            "content": "Persons who live in the village or town are called gräma-niväsé, and those who live in the forest are called vana-väsé or vänaprastha. The vänaprasthas, who have retired from family life, generally lament about their past family life because it engaged them in trying to fulfill lusty desires. Prahläda Mahäräja said that one should retire from family life as soon as possible, and he described family life as the darkest well (hitvätma-pätaà gåham andha-küpam). If one continuously or permanently concentrates on living with his family, he should be understood to be killing himself. In the Vedic civilization, therefore, it is recommended that one retire from family life at the end of his fiftieth year and go to vana, the forest. When he becomes expert or accustomed to forest life, or retired life as a vänaprastha, he should accept sannyäsa. Vanaà gato yad dharim äçrayeta . Sannyäsa means accepting unalloyed engagement in the service of the Lord. Vedic civilization therefore recommends four different stages of life-brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. One should be very much ashamed of remaining a householder and not promoting oneself to the two higher stages, namely vänaprastha and sannyäsa."
