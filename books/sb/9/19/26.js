Muktir hitvänyathä rüpaà svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù ). One thinks that there is no God or controller and that one is independent and can do anything. This is the material condition, and when one awakens from this ignorance, he is called liberated. Mahäräja Yayäti had delivered Devayäné from the well, and finally, as a dutiful husband, he instructed her with the story about the he-goat and she-goat and thus delivered her from the misconception of material happiness. Devayäné was quite competent to understand her liberated husband, and therefore she decided to follow him as his faithful wife."
