    "translation": "Because King Yayäti completely surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva, he was freed from all contamination of the material modes of nature. Because of his self-realization, he was able to fix his mind upon the Transcendence [Parabrahman, Väsudeva], and thus he ultimately achieved the position of an associate of the Lord.",

Caitanya Mahäprabhu also says, ceto-darpaëa-märjanam:  the process of hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord washes away the dirty things accumulated in the core of the heart. As soon as one is freed from all the dirt of material contamination, as Mahäräja Yayäti was, one's original position as an associate of the Lord is revealed. This is called svarüpa-siddhi, or personal perfection."
