A tiny baby bird, dependent fully on its father and mother even to eat, suddenly flies away from the nest when its wings have grown. Similarly, if one fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is immediately liberated from the bondage of conditioned life, as promised by the Lord Himself (ahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo mokñayiñyämi :"

I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.\" Lord Viñëu is so powerful that He can deliver anyone at once if He is pleased to do so. And Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, can be pleased immediately if we accept His order by surrendering unto Him, as Mahäräja Yayäti did. Mahäräja Yayäti was eager to serve Väsudeva, Kåñëa, and therefore as soon as he wanted to renounce material life, Lord Väsudeva helped him. We must therefore be very sincere in surrendering ourselves unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Then we can immediately be liberated from all the bondage of conditioned life. This is clearly expressed in the next verse."
