Unless one gives up such desires, one's mind cannot be freed from material contamination. Therefore, if one is at all interested in being freed from the bondage of repeated birth, death, old age and disease, after a certain age one must go to the forest. païcäçordhvaà vanaà vrajet. After fifty years of age, one should voluntarily give up family life and go to the forest. The best forest is Våndävana, where one need not live with the animals but can associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who never leaves Våndävana. Cultivating Kåñëa consciousness in Våndävana is the best means of being liberated from material bondage, for in Våndävana one can automatically meditate upon Kåñëa. Våndävana has many temples, and in one or more of these temples one may see the form of the Supreme Lord as Rädhä-Kåñëa or Kåñëa-Balaräma and meditate upon this form. As expressed here by the words brahmaëy adhyäya, one should concentrate one's mind upon the Supreme Lord, Parabrahman. This Parabrahman is Kåñëa, as confirmed by Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä (paraà brahma paraà dhäma pavitraà paramaà bhavän  Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu took sannyäsa to show His causeless mercy to the mäyä-mågas, the people of this material world, who suffer because of lusty desires. One should follow the principles of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and always think of Kåñëa in full Kåñëa consciousness. Then one will be eligible to live in Våndävana, and his life will be successful."
