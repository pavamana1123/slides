You live as the Supersoul in everyone's heart and are smaller than the smallest, yet You are greater than the greatest and are all-pervading. You appear completely silent, having nothing to do, but this is due to Your all-pervading nature and Your fullness in all opulences. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",

Surrender to Väsudeva is the result of hearing about Him for many, many births. As soon as one surrenders unto Väsudeva, one is liberated immediately. Because of her association with her great husband, Mahäräja Yayäti, Devayäné became purified, adopted the means of bhakti-yoga, and thus became liberated."
