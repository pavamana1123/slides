    "translation": "Thereafter, Devayäné, the daughter of Çukräcärya, understood that the materialistic association of husband, friends and relatives is like the association in a hotel full of tourists. The relationships of society, friendship and love are created by the mäyä of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exactly as in a dream. By the grace of Kåñëa, Devayäné gave up her imaginary position in the material world. Completely fixing her mind upon Kåñëa, she achieved liberation from the gross and subtle bodies.",

One should know that the association of society, friendship, love, nationalism, religion and so on are nothing but creations of mäyä. One's only business is to become Kåñëa conscious and render service unto Kåñëa as extensively as possible for a living being. In this way one is liberated from material bondage. By the grace of Kåñëa, Devayäné attained this state through the instructions of her husband."
