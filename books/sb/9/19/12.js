Existence in such a dark well is certainly suicidal. If one wants relief from the miserable condition of material life, one must voluntarily give up his lusty relationship with his wife; otherwise there is no question of self-realization. Unless one is extremely advanced in spiritual consciousness, household life is nothing but a dark well in which one commits suicide. Prahläda Mahäräja therefore recommended that in due time, at least after one's fiftieth year, one must give up household life and go to the forest. Vanaà gato yad dharim äçrayeta . There one should seek shelter at the lotus feet of Hari."
