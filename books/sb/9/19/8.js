    "translation": "Aggrieved by her husband's behavior with another, the she-goat thought that the he-goat was not actually her friend but was hardhearted and was her friend only for the time being. Therefore, because her husband was lusty, she left him and returned to her former maintainer.",

            "content": "The word sväminam is significant. Svämé means \"caretaker\" or \"master.\" Devayäné was cared for by Çukräcärya before her marriage, and after her marriage she was cared for by Yayäti, but here the word sväminam indicates that Devayäné left the protection of her husband, Yayäti, and returned to her former protector, Çukräcärya. Vedic civilization recommends that a woman stay under the protection of a man. During childhood she should be cared for by her father, in youth by her husband, and in old age by a grown son. In any stage of life, a woman should not have independence."
