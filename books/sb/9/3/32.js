Brahmä informed King Kakudmé that twenty-seven mahä-yugas, each consisting of the four periods Satya, Tretä, Dväpara and Kali, had already passed. All the kings and other great personalities born in those yugas had now departed from memory into obscurity. This is the way of time as it moves through past, present and future."
