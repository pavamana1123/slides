    "translation": "O my daughter, who were born in a respectable family, how have you degraded your consciousness in this way? How is it that you are shamelessly maintaining a paramour? You will thus degrade the dynasties of both your father and your husband to hellish life.",

            "content": "It is quite clear that according to Vedic culture a woman who accepts a paramour or second husband in the presence of the husband she has married is certainly responsible for the degradation of her father's family and the family of her husband. The rules of Vedic culture in this regard are strictly observed in the respectable families of brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas even today; only the çüdras are degraded in this matter. For a woman of the brähmaëa, kñatriya or vaiçya class to accept another husband in the presence of the husband she has married, or to file for divorce or accept a boyfriend or paramour, is unacceptable in the Vedic culture. Therefore King Çaryäti, who did not know the real facts of Cyavana Muni's transformation, was surprised to see the behavior of his daughter."
