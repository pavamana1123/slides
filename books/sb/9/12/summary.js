            "content": "Following in the genealogical table of Lord Rämacandra's dynasty, Kuça, the Lord's son, was followed consecutively by Atithi, Niñadha, Nabha, Puëòaréka, Kñemadhanvä, Devänéka, Anéha, Päriyätra, Balasthala, Vajranäbha, Sagaëa and Vidhåti. These personalities ruled the world. From Vidhåti came Hiraëyanäbha, who later became the disciple of Jaimini and propounded the system of mystic yoga in which Yäjïavalkya was initiated. Following in this dynasty were Puñpa, Dhruvasandhi, Sudarçana, Agnivarëa, Çéghra and Maru. Maru attained full perfection in the practice of yoga, and he still lives in the village of Kaläpa. At the end of this age of Kali, he will revive the dynasty of the sun-god. Next in the dynasty were Prasuçruta, Sandhi, Amarñaëa, Mahasvän, Viçvabähu, Prasenajit, Takñaka and Båhadbala, who was later killed by Abhimanyu. Çukadeva Gosvämé said that these were all kings who had passed away. The future descendants of Båhadbala will be Båhadraëa, Ürukriya, Vatsavåddha, Prativyoma, Bhänu, Diväka, Sahadeva, Båhadaçva, Bhänumän, Pratékäçva, Supratéka, Marudeva, Sunakñatra, Puñkara, Antarikña, Sutapä, Amitrajit, Båhadräja, Barhi, Kåtaïjaya, Raëaïjaya, Saïjaya, Çäkya, Çuddhoda, Läìgala, Prasenajit, Kñudraka, Raëaka, Suratha and Sumitra. All of them will become kings one after another. Sumitra, coming in this age of Kali, will be the last king in the Ikñväku dynasty; after him, the dynasty will be extinguished."
