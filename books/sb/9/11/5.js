The brähmaëas acted exactly like brähmaëas, the kñatriyas exactly like kñatriyas, and so on. Therefore, when Lord Rämacandra gave everything in charity to the brähmaëas, the brähmaëas, being qualified, wisely considered that brähmaëas are not meant to possess property to make a profit from it. The qualifications of a brähmaëa are given in Bhagavad-gétä :"

            "content": "\"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness—these are the qualities by which the brähmaëas work.\" The brahminical character offers no scope for possessing land and ruling citizens; these are the duties of a kñatriya. Therefore, although the brähmaëas did not refuse Lord Rämacandra's gift, after accepting it they returned it to the King. The brähmaëas were so pleased with Lord Rämacandra's affection toward them that their hearts melted. They saw that Lord Rämacandra, aside from being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was fully qualified as a kñatriya and was exemplary in character. One of the qualifications of a kñatriya is to be charitable. A kñatriya, or ruler, levies taxes upon the citizens not for his personal sense gratification but to give charity in suitable cases. Dänam éçvara-bhävaù. On one hand, kñatriyas have the propensity to rule, but on the other they are very liberal with charity. When Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira gave charity, he engaged Karëa to take charge of distributing it. Karëa was very famous as Dätä Karëa. The word dätä refers to one who gives charity very liberally. The kings always kept a large quantity of food grains in stock, and whenever there was any scarcity of grains, they would distribute grains in charity. A kñatriya's duty is to give charity, and a brähmaëa's duty is to accept charity, but not more than needed to maintain body and soul together. Therefore, when the brähmaëas were given so much land by Lord Rämacandra, they returned it to Him and were not greedy."
