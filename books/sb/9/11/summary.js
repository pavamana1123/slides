            "content": "Lord Rämacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, performed various sacrifices by which to worship Himself, and at the end of these sacrifices He gave land to the hotä, adhvaryu, udgätä and brahmä priests. He gave them the eastern, western, northern and southern directions respectively, and the balance He gave to the äcärya. Lord Rämacandra's faith in the brähmaëas and affection for His servants was observed by all the brähmaëas, who then offered their prayers to the Lord and returned whatever they had taken from Him. They regarded the enlightenment given to them by the Lord within the core of their hearts as a sufficient contribution. Lord Rämacandra subsequently dressed Himself like an ordinary person and began wandering within the capital to understand what impression the citizens had of Him. By chance, one night He heard a man talking to his wife, who had gone to another man's house. In the course of rebuking his wife, the man spoke suspiciously of the character of Sétädevé. The Lord immediately returned home, and, fearing such rumors, He superficially decided to give up Sétädevé's company. Thus He banished Sétädevé, who was pregnant, to the shelter of Välméki Muni, where she gave birth to twin sons, named Lava and Kuça. In Ayodhyä, Lakñmaëa begot two sons named Aìgada and Citraketu, Bharata begot two sons named Takña and Puñkala, and Çatrughna begot two sons named Subähu and Çrutasena. When Bharata went out to conquer various lands on behalf of the emperor, Lord Rämacandra, He fought many millions of Gandharvas. By killing them in the fight, He acquired immense wealth, which He then brought home. Çatrughna killed a demon named Lavaëa at Madhuvana and thus established the capital of Mathurä. Meanwhile, Sétädevé placed her two sons in the care of Välméki Muni and then entered into the earth. Upon hearing of this, Lord Rämacandra was very much aggrieved, and thus He performed sacrifices for thirteen thousand years. After describing the pastimes of Lord Rämacandra's disappearance and establishing that the Lord appears for His pastimes only, Çukadeva Gosvämé ends this chapter by describing the results of hearing about the activities of Lord Rämacandra and by describing how the Lord protected His citizens and displayed affection for His brothers."
