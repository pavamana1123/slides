I do not need any material benediction.\" Similarly, when Prahläda Mahäräja was offered a benediction by Lord Nåsiàhadeva, he also refused to accept it and instead declared that a devotee should not be like a vaëik, a mercantile man who gives something in exchange for some profit. One who becomes a devotee for some material profit is not a pure devotee. Brähmaëas are always enlightened by the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the heart (sarvasya cähaà hådi sanniviñöo mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca ). And because the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas are always directed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are not greedy for material wealth. What is absolutely necessary they possess, but they do not want an expanded kingdom. An example of this was given by Vämanadeva. Acting as a brahmacäré, Lord Vämanadeva wanted only three paces of land. Aspiring to possess more and more for personal sense gratification is simply ignorance, and this ignorance is conspicuous by its absence from the heart of a brähmaëa or Vaiñëava."
