            "content": "\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\" Here this is confirmed. All the inhabitants of Ayodhyä who saw Lord Rämacandra as citizens, served Him as servants, sat and talked with Him as friends or were somehow or other present during His reign went back home, back to Godhead. After giving up the body, the devotee who becomes perfect in devotional service enters that particular universe where Lord Rämacandra or Lord Kåñëa is engaged in His pastimes. Then, after being trained to serve the Lord in various capacities in that prakaöa-lélä, the devotee is finally promoted to sanätana-dhäma, the supreme abode in the spiritual world. This sanätana-dhäma is also mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä (paras tasmät tu bhävo 'nyo 'vyakto 'vyaktät sanätanaù ). One who enters the transcendental pastimes of the Lord is called nitya-lélä-praviñöa. To understand clearly why Lord Rämacandra returned, it is mentioned herewith that the Lord went to that particular place where the bhakti-yogés go. The impersonalists misunderstand the statements of Çrémad-Bhägavatam to mean that the Lord entered His own effulgence and therefore become impersonal. But the Lord is a person, and His devotees are persons. Indeed, the living entities, like the Lord, were persons in the past, they are persons in the present, and they will continue to be persons even after giving up the body. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä."
