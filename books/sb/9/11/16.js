In the spiritual world also there are feelings of separation, but such feelings are considered spiritual bliss. Grief in separation exists even in the Absolute, but such feelings of separation in the spiritual world are transcendentally blissful. Such feelings are a sign of tasya prema-vaçyatva-svabhäva, being under the influence of hlädiné-çakti and being controlled by love. In the material world such feelings of separation are only a perverted reflection."
