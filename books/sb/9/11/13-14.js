    "translation": "Çatrughna had two sons, named Subähu and Çrutasena. When Lord Bharata went to conquer all directions, He had to kill many millions of Gandharvas, who are generally pretenders. Taking all their wealth, He offered it to Lord Rämacandra. Çatrughna also killed a Räkñasa named Lavaëa, who was the son of Madhu Räkñasa. Thus He established in the great forest known as Madhuvana the town known as Mathurä.",
