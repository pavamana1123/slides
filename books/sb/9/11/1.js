            "content": "\"As pouring water on the root of a tree nourishes the trunk, branches, twigs and leaves, and as supplying food to the stomach enlivens the senses and limbs of the body, worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead satisfies the demigods, who are part of that Supreme Personality.\" Performing yajïa involves worshiping the Supreme Lord. Here the Supreme Lord worshiped the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is said, bhagavän ätmanätmänam éje: the Lord worshiped Himself by Himself. This does not, of course, justify the Mäyäväda philosophy, by which one thinks himself the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The jéva, the living entity, is always different from the Supreme Lord. The living entities (vibhinnäàça) never become one with the Lord, although Mäyävädés sometimes imitate the Lord's worship of Himself. Lord Kåñëa meditated upon Himself every morning as a gåhastha, and similarly Lord Rämacandra performed yajïas to satisfy Himself, but this does not mean that an ordinary living being should imitate the Lord by accepting the process of ahaìgraha-upäsanä. Such unauthorized worship is not recommended herein."
