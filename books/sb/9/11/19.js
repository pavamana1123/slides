    "translation": "After completing the sacrifice, Lord Rämacandra, whose lotus feet were sometimes pierced by thorns when He lived in Daëòakäraëya, placed those lotus feet in the hearts of those who always think of Him. Then He entered His own abode, the Vaikuëöha planet beyond the brahmajyoti.",

Sometimes when Lord Rämacandra wandered in the forest of Daëòakäraëya, thorns pricked His lotus feet. The devotees, upon thinking of this, would faint. The Lord does not feel pain or pleasure from any action or reaction of this material world, but the devotees cannot tolerate even the pricking of the Lord's lotus feet by a thorn. This was the attitude of the gopés when they thought of Kåñëa wandering in the forest, with pebbles and grains of sand pricking His lotus feet. This tribulation in the heart of a devotee cannot be understood by karmés, jïänés or yogés. The devotees, who could not tolerate even thinking of the Lord's lotus feet being pricked by a thorn, were again put into tribulation by thinking of the Lord's disappearance, for the Lord had to return to His abode after finishing His pastimes in this material world."

The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes.\" (BS 5.40) The brahmajyoti is the beginning of the spiritual world, and beyond the brahmajyoti are the Vaikuëöha planets. In other words, the brahmajyoti stays outside the Vaikuëöha planets, just as the sunshine stays outside the sun. To enter the sun planet, one must go through the sunshine. Similarly, when the Lord or His devotees enter the Vaikuëöha planets, they go through the brahmajyoti. The jïänés, or monistic philosophers, because of their impersonal conception of the Lord, cannot enter the Vaikuëöha planets, but they also cannot stay eternally in the brahmajyoti. Thus after some time they fall again to this material world. Äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù patanty adho 'nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù . The Vaikuëöha planets are covered by the brahmajyoti, and therefore one cannot properly understand what those Vaikuëöha planets are unless one is a pure devotee."
