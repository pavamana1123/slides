            "content": "The son of Rohita was known as Harita, and the son of Harita was Campa, who constructed a township known as Campäpuré. The son of Campa was Sudeva, the son of Sudeva was Vijaya, the son of Vijaya was Bharuka, and the son of Bharuka was Våka. Bähuka, the son of Våka, was greatly disturbed by his enemies, and therefore he left home with his wife and went to the forest. When he died there, his wife wanted to accept the principles of saté, dying with her husband, but when she was about to die a sage named Aurva found that she was pregnant and forbade her to do so. The co-wives of this wife of Bähuka gave her poison with her food, but still her son was born with the poison. The son was therefore named Sagara (sa means \"with,\" and gara means \"poison\"). Following the instructions of the great sage Aurva, King Sagara reformed many clans, including the Yavanas, Çakas, Haihayas and Barbaras. The king did not kill them, but reformed them. Then, again following the instructions of Aurva, King Sagara performed açvamedha sacrifices, but the horse needed for such a sacrifice was stolen by Indra, the King of heaven. King Sagara had two wives, named Sumati and Keçiné. While searching for the horse, the sons of Sumati extensively dug up the surface of the earth and in this way dug a trench, which later became known as the Sägara Ocean. In the course of this search, they came upon the great personality Kapiladeva and thought Him to have stolen the horse. With this offensive understanding, they attacked Him and were all burned to ashes. Keçiné, the second wife of King Sagara, had a son named Asamaïjasa, whose son Aàçumän later searched for the horse and delivered his uncles. Upon approaching Kapiladeva, Aàçumän saw both the horse meant for sacrifice and a pile of ashes. Aàçumän offered prayers to Kapiladeva, who was very pleased by his prayers and who returned the horse. After getting back the horse, however, Aàçumän still stood before Kapiladeva, and Kapiladeva could understand that Aàçumän was praying for the deliverance of his forefathers. Thus Kapiladeva offered the instruction that they could be delivered by water from the Ganges. Aàçumän then offered respectful obeisances to Kapiladeva, circumambulated Him, and left that place with the horse for sacrifice. When King Sagara finished his yajïa, he handed over the kingdom to Aàçumän and, following the advice of Aurva, attained salvation."
