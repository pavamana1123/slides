    "translation": "Aàçumän said: My Lord, even Lord Brahmä is to this very day unable to understand Your position, which is far beyond himself, either by meditation or by mental speculation. So what to speak of others like us, who have been created by Brahmä in various forms as demigods, animals, human beings, birds and beasts? We are completely in ignorance. Therefore, how can we know You, who are the Transcendence?",

Even Lord Brahmä is in the mode of goodness. Similarly, the demigods are generally in the mode of passion, and living entities lower than the demigods, such as human beings and animals, are in the mode of ignorance, or in mixed goodness, passion and ignorance. Therefore Aàçumän wanted to explain that because his uncles, who had burnt to ashes, were under the modes of material nature, they could not understand Lord Kapiladeva. \"Because You are beyond even the direct and indirect intelligence of Lord Brahmä,\" he prayed, \"unless we are enlightened by Your Lordship it will not be possible for us to understand You.\""
