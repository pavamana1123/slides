When situated in this original position, the living entity is unaffected by the modes of material nature. Sa guëän samatétyaitän brahma-bhüyäya kalpate , therefore, Kåñëa advises Arjuna, traiguëya-viñayä vedä nistraiguëyo bhavärjuna: one must rise above the influence of the three modes of material nature. One who stays within the influence of the three material modes is unable to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
