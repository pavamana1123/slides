    "translation": "Kapila Muni enunciated in this material world the Säìkhya philosophy, which is a strong boat with which to cross over the ocean of nescience. Indeed, a person eager to cross the ocean of the material world may take shelter of this philosophy. In such a greatly learned person, situated on the elevated platform of transcendence, how can there be any distinction between enemy and friend?",

He is unaffected by the false distinctions between good and bad in the material world. Therefore, such an exalted person is samaù sarveñu bhüteñu; that is to say, he is equal toward everyone, not distinguishing between friend and enemy. Because he is on the absolute platform, free from material contamination, he is called parätma-bhüta or brahma-bhüta. Kapila Muni, therefore, was not at all angry at the sons of Sagara Mahäräja; rather, they were burnt to ashes by the heat of their own bodies."
