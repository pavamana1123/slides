Therefore it is said that out of many siddhas, the souls who have already realized the Absolute Truth, one may understand Kåñëa, who exactly resembles a human being (naräkåti). This human form was explained by Kåñëa Himself after He manifested the viräö-rüpa. The viräö-rüpa is not the original form of the Lord; the Lord's original form is Dvibhuja-çyämasundara, Muralédhara, the Lord with two hands, playing a flute (yaà çyämasundaram acintya-guëa-svarüpam). The Lord's forms are proof of His inconceivable qualities. Although the Lord maintains innumerable universes within the period of His breath, He is dressed with a form exactly like that of a human being. That does not mean, however, that He is a human being. This is His original form, but because He looks like a human being, those with a poor fund of knowledge consider Him an ordinary man. The Lord says:"

Mäyäväda philosophy says that the Lord is originally impersonal but assumes a human form and many other forms when He descends. Actually, however, He is originally like a human being, and the impersonal Brahman consists of the rays of His body (yasya prabhä prabhavato jagad-aëòa-koöi (BS 5.40))."
