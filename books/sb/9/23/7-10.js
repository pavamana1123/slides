    "translation": "From Diviratha came a son named Dharmaratha, and his son was Citraratha, who was celebrated as Romapäda. Romapäda, however, was without issue, and therefore his friend Mahäräja Daçaratha gave him his own daughter, named Çäntä. Romapäda accepted her as his daughter, and thereafter she married Åñyaçåìga. When the demigods from the heavenly planets failed to shower rain, Åñyaçåìga was appointed the priest for performing a sacrifice, after being brought from the forest by the allurement of prostitutes, who danced, staged theatrical performances accompanied by music, and embraced and worshiped him. After Åñyaçåìga came, the rain fell. Thereafter, Åñyaçåìga performed a son-giving sacrifice on behalf of Mahäräja Daçaratha, who had no issue, and then Mahäräja Daçaratha had sons. From Romapäda, by the mercy of Åñyaçåìga, Caturaìga was born, and from Caturaìga came Påthuläkña.",
