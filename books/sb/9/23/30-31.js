The son of Yadu named Kroñöä had a son named Våjinavän. The son of Våjinavän was Svähita; the son of Svähita, Viñadgu; the son of Viñadgu, Citraratha; and the son of Citraratha, Çaçabindu. The greatly fortunate Çaçabindu, who was a great mystic, possessed fourteen opulences and was the owner of fourteen great jewels. Thus he became the emperor of the world.",
