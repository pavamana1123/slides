    "translation": "Long, long ago, Jyämagha had satisfied the demigods and Pitäs by worshiping them. Now, by their mercy, Jyämagha's words came true. Although Çaibyä was barren, by the grace of the demigods she became pregnant and in due course of time gave birth to a child named Vidarbha. Before the child's birth, the girl had been accepted as a daughter-in-law, and therefore Vidarbha actually married her when he grew up.",
