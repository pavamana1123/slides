By His pleasing smiles, His affectionate behavior, His instructions and His uncommon pastimes like raising Govardhana Hill, the Lord, appearing in His transcendental body, pleased all of human society.",

            "content": "The words nålokaà ramayäm äsa mürtyä sarväìga-ramyayä are significant. Kåñëa is the original form. Bhagavän, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is therefore described here by the word mürtyä. The word mürti means \"form.\" Kåñëa, or God, is never impersonal; the impersonal feature is but a manifestation of His transcendental body (yasya prabhä prabhavato jagad-aëòa-koöi (BS 5.40)). The Lord is naräkåti, exactly resembling the form of a human being, but His form is different from ours. Therefore the word sarväìga-ramyayä informs us that every part of His body is pleasing for everyone to see. Apart from His smiling face, every part of His body—His hands, His legs, His chest—is pleasing to the devotees, who cannot at any time stop seeing the beautiful form of the Lord."
