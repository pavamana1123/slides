The mission of Lord Kåñëa was performed on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, for by the Lord's mercy Arjuna was victorious due to being a great devotee whereas the others were killed simply by the Lord's glance, which cleansed them of all sinful activities and enabled them to attain särüpya. Finally, Lord Kåñëa instructed Uddhava about the transcendental life of devotional service, and then, in due course of time, He returned to His abode. The Lord's instructions in the form of Bhagavad-gétä are full of jïäna and vairägya, knowledge and renunciation. In the human form of life, one must learn these two things—how to become detached from the material world and how to acquire full knowledge in spiritual life. This is the Lord's mission (pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm). After executing His complete mission, the Lord returned to His home, Goloka Våndävana."
