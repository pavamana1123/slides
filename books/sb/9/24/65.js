    "translation": "Kåñëa's face is decorated with ornaments, such as earrings resembling sharks. His ears are beautiful, His cheeks brilliant, and His smiling attractive to everyone. Whoever sees Lord Kåñëa sees a festival. His face and body are fully satisfying for everyone to see, but the devotees are angry at the creator for the disturbance caused by the momentary blinking of their eyes.",

            "content": "\"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.\" Unless one is qualified to understand Kåñëa, one cannot appreciate the presence of Kåñëa on earth. Among the Bhojas, Våñëis, Andhakas, Päëòavas and many other kings intimately related with Kåñëa, the intimate relationship between Kåñëa and the inhabitants of Våndävana is especially to be noted. That relationship is described in this verse by the words nityotsavaà na tatåpur dåçibhiù pibantyaù. The inhabitants of Våndävana especially, such as the cowherd boys, the cows, the calves, the gopés and Kåñëa's father and mother, were never fully satisfied, although they saw Kåñëa's beautiful features constantly. Seeing Kåñëa is described here as nitya-utsava, a daily festival. The inhabitants of Våndävana saw Kåñëa almost every moment, but when Kåñëa left the village for the pasturing grounds, where He tended the cows and calves, the gopés were very much afflicted because they saw Kåñëa walking on the sand and thought that Kåñëa's lotus feet, which they dared not place on their breasts because they thought their breasts not soft enough, were being pierced by broken chips of stone. By even thinking of this, the gopés were affected, and they cried at home. These gopés, who were therefore the exalted friends of Kåñëa, saw Kåñëa constantly, but because their eyelids disturbed their vision of Kåñëa, the gopés condemned the creator, Lord Brahmä. Therefore the beauty of Kåñëa, especially the beauty of His face, is described here. At the end of the Ninth Canto, in the Twenty-fourth Chapter, we find a hint of Kåñëa's beauty. Now we are proceeding to the Tenth Canto, which is considered Kåñëa's head. The entire Çrémad-Bhägavata Puräëa is the embodiment of Kåñëa's form, and the Tenth Canto is His face. This verse gives a hint of how beautiful His face is. Kåñëa's smiling face, with His cheeks, His lips, the ornaments in His ears, His chewing of betel nuts—all this was minutely observed by the gopés, who thus enjoyed transcendental bliss, so much so that they were never fully satisfied to see Kåñëa's face, but instead condemned the creator of the body for making eyelids that obstructed their vision. The beauty of Kåñëa's face was therefore much more appreciated by the gopés than by His friends the cowherd boys or even by Yaçodä Mätä, who was also interested in decorating the face of Kåñëa."
