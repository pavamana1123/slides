Therefore although the sun-god, after appearing before Påthä, wanted to give her a child, Påthä hesitated because she was still unmarried. To keep her virginity undisturbed, the sun-god arranged to give her a child that came from her ear, and therefore the child was known as Karëa. The custom is that a girl should be married akñata-yoni, that is, with her virginity undisturbed. A girl should never bear a child before her marriage."
