    "translation": "To show causeless mercy to the devotees who would take birth in the future in this age of Kali, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, acted in such a way that simply by remembering Him one will be freed from all the lamentation and unhappiness of material existence. [In other words, He acted so that all future devotees, by accepting the instructions of Kåñëa consciousness stated in Bhagavad-gétä, could be relieved from the pangs of material existence.]",

Kåñëa actually appears for the deliverance of the sädhus, or bhaktas, but by killing the demons He shows them mercy also, for anyone killed by Kåñëa is liberated. Whether the Lord kills or gives protection, He is kind to both the demons and the devotees."
