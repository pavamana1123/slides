    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, known as lélä-puruñottama, appeared as the son of Vasudeva but immediately left His father's home and went to Våndävana to expand His loving relationship with His confidential devotees. In Våndävana the Lord killed many demons, and afterwards He returned to Dvärakä, where according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women, begot through them hundreds of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the principles of householder life.",

            "content": "As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm: the Lord appears in order to protect the devotees and kill the demons. This was fully exhibited by His personal behavior. In Bhagavad-gétä the Lord is understood by Arjuna to be puruñaà çäçvataà divyam—the eternal, transcendental Supreme Person. Here also we find the words utpädya teñu puruñaù. Therefore it is to be concluded that the Absolute Truth is puruña, a person. The impersonal feature is but one of the features of His personality. Ultimately, He is a person; He is not impersonal. And not only is He puruña, a person, but He is the lélä-puruñottama, the best of all persons."
