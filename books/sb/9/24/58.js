Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\" All the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are as good as the Lord qualitatively, but quantitatively there is a great difference between them, for the Lord is unlimited whereas the living entities are limited. Thus the Lord possesses unlimited potency for pleasure, and the living entities have a limited pleasure potency. Änandamayo 'bhyäsät (Vedänta-sütra 1.1.12). Both the Lord and the living entity, being qualitatively spirit soul, have the tendency for peaceful enjoyment, but when the part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead unfortunately wants to enjoy independently, without Kåñëa, he is put into the material world, where he begins his life as Brahmä and is gradually degraded to the status of an ant or a worm in stool. This is called manaù ñañöhänéndriyäëi prakåti-sthäni karñati. There is a great struggle for existence because the living entity conditioned by material nature is under nature's full control (prakåteù kriyamäëäni guëaiù karmäëi sarvaçaù ). Because of his limited knowledge, however, the living entity thinks he is enjoying in this material world. Manaù ñañöhänéndriyäëi prakåti-sthäni karñati. He is actually under the full control of material nature, but still he thinks himself independent (ahaìkära-vimüòhätmä kartäham iti manyate). Even when he is elevated by speculative knowledge and tries to merge into the existence of Brahman, the same disease continues."

Therefore out of compassion Kåñëa creates this material world to give the living entity a chance to understand his real position. Bhagavad-gétä and similar Vedic literatures are presented so that the living being may understand his relationship with Kåñëa. Vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù . All these Vedic literatures are meant to enable the human being to understand what he is, what his actual position is, and what his relationship is with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called brahma-jijïäsä. Every conditioned soul is struggling, but human life provides the best chance for him to understand his position. Therefore this verse says, anugrahas tan-nivåtteù, indicating that the false life of repeated birth and death must be stopped and the conditioned soul should be educated. This is the purpose of the creation."
