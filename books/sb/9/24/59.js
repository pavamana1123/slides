    "translation": "Although the demons who take possession of the government are dressed like men of government, they do not know the duty of the government. Consequently, by the arrangement of God, such demons, who possess great military strength, fight with one another, and thus the great burden of demons on the surface of the earth is reduced. The demons increase their military power by the will of the Supreme, so that their numbers will be diminished and the devotees will have a chance to advance in Kåñëa consciousness.",

Namo brahmaëya-deväya go-brähmaëa-hitäya ca. Kåñëa is very fond of brähmaëas and cows, The brähmaëas promulgate the cause of advancement in Kåñëa consciousness, and the cows give enough milk to maintain the body in the mode of goodness. The kñatriyas and the government should be advised by the brähmaëas. Next, the vaiçyas should produce enough foodstuffs, and the çüdras, who cannot do anything beneficial on their own, should serve the three higher classes (the brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas). This is the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that the conditioned souls will be released from the material condition and return home, back to Godhead. This is the purpose of Kåñëa's descent on the surface of the earth (pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm)."

Demons may falsely accuse the preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, but Kåñëa will arrange a fight between the demons in which all their military power will be engaged and both parties of demons will be annihilated."
