At the present time, in Kali-yuga, people are extremely sinful and bad (manda). They have no idea of spiritual life and are misusing the benefits of the human form to live like cats and dogs. Under these circumstances Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has inaugurated the Hare Kåñëa movement, which is not different from Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one associates with this movement, he directly associates with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. People should take advantage of the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra and thus gain relief from all the problems created in this age of Kali."
