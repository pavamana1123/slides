A kñatriya, however, is highly qualified when he is fierce in giving punishment to wrongdoers. These qualities are stated in Bhagavad-gétä ). If the son of a brähmaëa does not become like a brähmaëa, he may be called a kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra, according to his qualifications. The basic principle for dividing society is not a person's birth but his qualities and actions."
