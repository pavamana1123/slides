    "translation": "King Gädhi had a daughter named Satyavaté, whom a brähmaëa sage named Åcéka requested from the King to be his wife. King Gädhi, however, regarded Åcéka as an unfit husband for his daughter, and therefore he told the brähmaëa, \"My dear sir, I belong to the dynasty of Kuça. Because we are aristocratic kñatriyas, you have to give some dowry for my daughter. Therefore, bring at least one thousand horses, each as brilliant as moonshine and each having one black ear, whether right or left.\"",

From the marriage of Satyavaté with Åcéka Muni would come a son with the spirit of a kñatriya. King Gädhi demanded that an uncommon request be fulfilled before the brähmaëa Åcéka could marry his daughter."
