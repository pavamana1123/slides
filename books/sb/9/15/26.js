Havirdhäném refers to a cow required for supplying havis, or ghee, for the performance of ritualistic ceremonies in sacrifices. In human life, one should be trained to perform yajïas. As we are informed in Bhagavad-gétä ). Nonetheless, although they are forced to suffer, they think they are advancing in civilization (ahaìkära-vimüòhätmä kartäham iti manyate). The Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore meant to revive a mode of civilization in which everyone will be happy. This is the motive of our Kåñëa consciousness movement. Yajïe sukhena bhavantu."
