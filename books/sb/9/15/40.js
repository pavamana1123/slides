Cäëakya Paëòita says that the cuckoo bird, although very black, is beautiful because of its sweet voice. Similarly, a woman becomes beautiful by her chastity and faithfulness to her husband, and an ugly person becomes beautiful when he becomes a learned scholar. In the same way, brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras become beautiful by their qualities. Brähmaëas are beautiful when they are forgiving, kñatriyas when they are heroic and never retreat from fighting, vaiçyas when they enrich cultural activities and protect cows, and çüdras when they are faithful in the discharge of duties pleasing to their masters. Thus everyone becomes beautiful by his special qualities. And the special quality of the brähmaëa, as described here, is forgiveness."
