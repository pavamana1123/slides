            "content": "From the womb of Urvaçé came six sons, named Äyu, Çrutäyu, Satyäyu, Raya, Jaya and Vijaya. The son of Çrutäyu was Vasumän, the son of Satyäyu was Çrutaïjaya, the son of Raya was Eka, the son of Jaya was Amita, and the son of Vijaya was Bhéma. Bhéma's son was named Käïcana, the son of Käïcana was Hotraka, and the son of Hotraka was Jahnu, who was celebrated for having drunk all the water of the Ganges in one sip. The descendants of Jahnu, one after another, were Puru, Baläka, Ajaka and Kuça. The sons of Kuça were Kuçämbu, Tanaya, Vasu and Kuçanäbha. From Kuçämbu came Gädhi, who had a daughter named Satyavaté. Satyavaté married Åcéka Muni after the muni contributed a substantial dowry, and from the womb of Satyavaté by Åcéka Muni, Jamadagni was born. The son of Jamadagni was Räma, or Paraçuräma. When a king named Kärtavéryärjuna stole Jamadagni's desire cow, Paraçuräma, who is ascertained by learned experts to be a saktyäveça incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed Kärtavéryärjuna. Later, he annihilated the kñatriya dynasty twenty-one times. After Paraçuräma killed Kärtavéryärjuna, Jamadagni told him that killing a king is sinful and that as a brähmaëa he should have tolerated the offense. Therefore Jamadagni advised Paraçuräma to atone for his sin by traveling to various holy places."
