From the very day or moment he fully surrenders to Çré Kåñëa, even the most sinful person is freed. Nonetheless, as an example, Jamadagni advised his son Paraçuräma to worship the holy places. Because an ordinary person cannot immediately surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is advised to go from one holy place to another to find saintly persons and thus gradually be released from sinful reactions."
