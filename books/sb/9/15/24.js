            "content": "The Brahma-saàhitä informs us that the spiritual world, and especially the planet Goloka Våndävana, where Kåñëa lives, is full of surabhi cows (surabhér abhipälayantam (BS 5.29)). The surabhi cow is also called kämadhenu. Although Jamadagni possessed only one kämadhenu, he was able to get from it everything desirable. Thus he was able to receive the King, along with the King's great number of followers, ministers, soldiers, animals and palanquin carriers. When we speak of a king, we understand that he is accompanied by many followers. Jamadagni was able to receive all the King's followers properly and feed them sumptuously with food prepared in ghee. The King was astonished at how opulent Jamadagni was because of possessing only one cow, and therefore he became envious of the great sage. This was the beginning of his offense. Paraçuräma, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed Kärtavéryärjuna because Kärtavéryärjuna was too proud. One may possess unusual opulence in this material world, but if one becomes puffed up and acts whimsically he will be punished by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the lesson to learn from this history, in which Paraçuräma became angry at Kärtavéryärjuna and killed him and rid the entire world of kñatriyas twenty-one times."
