    "translation": "When the royal dynasty, being excessively proud because of the material modes of passion and ignorance, became irreligious and ceased to care for the laws enacted by the brähmaëas, Paraçuräma killed them. Although their offense was not very severe, he killed them to lessen the burden of the world.",

            "content": "The kñatriyas, or the ruling class, must govern the world in accordance with the rules and regulations enacted by great brähmaëas and saintly persons. As soon as the ruling class becomes irresponsible in regard to the religious principles, it becomes a burden on the earth. As stated here, rajas-tamo-våtaà, bhäram abrahmaëyam: when the ruling class is influenced by the lower modes of nature, namely ignorance and passion, it becomes a burden to the world and must then be annihilated by superior power. We actually see from modern history that monarchies have been abolished by various revolutions, but unfortunately the monarchies have been abolished to establish the supremacy of third-class and fourth-class men. Although monarchies overpowered by the modes of passion and ignorance have been abolished in the world, the inhabitants of the world are still unhappy, for although the qualities of the former monarchs were degraded by taints of ignorance, these monarchs have been replaced by men of the mercantile and worker classes whose qualities are even more degraded. When the government is actually guided by brähmaëas, or God conscious men, then there can be real happiness for the people. Therefore in previous times, when the ruling class was degraded to the modes of passion and ignorance, the brähmaëas, headed by such a kñatriya-spirited brähmaëa as Paraçuräma, killed them twenty-one consecutive times."

But if this system is neglected and the qualities and divisions of society are not considered, the result will be brahma-viö-kñatra-çüdräëäà yo balé bhavitä nåpaù: the so-called caste system of brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra will be meaningless. As a result, whoever somehow or other becomes powerful will be the king or president, and thus the prajäs, or citizens, will be so harassed that they will give up hearth and home and will go to the forest (yäsyanti giri-känanam) to escape harassment by government officials who have no mercy and are addicted to the ways of plunderers. Therefore the prajäs, or the people in general, must take to the Kåñëa consciousness movement, the Hare Kåñëa movement, which is the sound incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kali-käle näma-rüpe kåñëa-avatära: Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has now appeared as an incarnation by His holy name. Therefore, when the prajäs become Kåñëa conscious, they can then expect a good government and good society, a perfect life, and liberation from the bondage of material existence."
