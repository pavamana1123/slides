Therefore, although the great saints and sages were also powerful brähmaëas, they requested the demigods to revive Mahäräja Nimi's body, which had been preserved in various perfumed balms. One should not think that the demigods are powerful only in enjoying the senses; they are also powerful in such deeds as bringing life back to a dead body. There are many similar instances in the Vedic literature. For example, according to the history of Sävitré and Satyavän, Satyavän died and was being taken away by Yamaräja, but on the request of his wife, Sävitré, Satyavän was revived in the same body. This is an important fact about the power of the demigods."
