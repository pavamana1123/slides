Vasiñöha therefore requested Mahäräja Nimi to wait until Lord Indra's sacrifice was finished, but Mahäräja Nimi did not wait. He thought, \"Life is very short, so there is no need to wait.\" He therefore appointed another priest to perform the yajïa. Vasiñöha was very angry at King Nimi and cursed him, saying, \"May your body fall down.\" Cursed in that way, Mahäräja Nimi also became very angry, and he retaliated by saying, \"May your body also fall down.\" As a result of this cursing and countercursing, both of them died. After this incident, Vasiñöha took birth again, begotten by Mitra and Varuëa, who were agitated by Urvaçé."

When the sacrifice was over, the priests prayed for Nimi's life to all the demigods who had come to the arena of yajïa, but Mahäräja Nimi refused to take birth again in a material body because he considered the material body obnoxious. The great sages then churned Nimi's body, and as a result of this churning, Janaka was born."
