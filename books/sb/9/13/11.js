Under the circumstances, the demigods, having been requested by the saintly persons, gave him the benediction that he would be able to stay in his spiritual body. There are two kinds of spiritual bodies, as generally understood by common men. The term \"spiritual body\" is sometimes taken to refer to a ghostly body. An impious man who dies after sinful activities is sometimes condemned so that he cannot possess a gross material body of five material elements, but must live in a subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego. However, as explained in Bhagavad-gétä, devotees can give up the material body and attain a spiritual body free from all material tinges, gross and subtle (tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti mäm eti so 'rjuna ). Thus the demigods gave King Nimi the benediction that he would be able to stay in a purely spiritual body, free from all gross and subtle material contamination."

            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead can be seen or unseen according to His own transcendental desire; similarly, a devotee, being jévan-mukta, can be seen or not, as he chooses. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, nähaà prakäçaù sarvasya yogamäyä-samävåtaù:  [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.2.234] Kåñëa and His name, fame, qualities and paraphernalia cannot be materially understood. Unless one is advanced in spiritual life (sevonmukhe hi jihvädau), one cannot see Kåñëa. Therefore the ability to see Kåñëa depends on Kåñëa's mercy. The same privilege of being seen or unseen according to one's own desire was given to Mahäräja Nimi. Thus he lived in his original, spiritual body as an associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
