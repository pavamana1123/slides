At the present moment this danger always exists because of government by the people. Here we can see that the great sages got a son from Nimi's material body to guide the citizens properly, for such guidance is the duty of a kñatriya king. A kñatriya is one who saves the citizens from being injured. In the so-called people's government there is no trained kñatriya king; as soon as someone strong accumulates votes, he becomes the minister or president, without training from the learned brähmaëas expert in the çästras. Indeed, we see that in some countries the government changes from party to party, and therefore the men in charge of the government are more eager to protect their position than to see that the citizens are happy. The Vedic civilization prefers monarchy. People liked the government of Lord Rämacandra, the government of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and the governments of Mahäräja Parékñit, Mahäräja Ambaréña and Mahäräja Prahläda. There are many instances of excellent government under a monarch. Gradually the democratic government is becoming unfit for the needs of the people, and therefore some parties are trying to elect a dictator. A dictatorship is the same as a monarchy, but without a trained leader. Actually people will be happy when a trained leader, whether a monarch or a dictator, takes control of the government and rules the people according to the standard regulations of the authorized scriptures."
