    "translation": "King Rantideva had no ambition to enjoy material benefits from the demigods. He offered them obeisances, but because he was factually attached to Lord Viñëu, Väsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he fixed his mind at Lord Viñëu's lotus feet.",

As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , kämais tais tair håta jïänäù prapadyante 'nya-devatäù: those befooled by the illusion of the material energy worship gods other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, although Rantideva was personally able to see Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, he did not hanker to take material benefits from them. Rather, he fixed his mind upon Lord Väsudeva and rendered devotional service unto Him. This is the sign of a pure devotee, whose heart is not adulterated by material desires."
