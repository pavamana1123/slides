On the other hand, if one is born a vaiçya, by his activities he can become a brähmaëa. This is confirmed by Närada Muni. Yasya yal-lakñaëaà proktam. The members of the varëas, or social orders-brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra-must be ascertained by their symptoms, not by birth. Birth is immaterial; quality is essential."
