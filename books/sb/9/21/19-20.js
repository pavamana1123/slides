    "translation": "From Garga came a son named Çini, and his son was Gärgya. Although Gärgya was a kñatriya, there came from him a generation of brahmaëas. From Mahävérya came a son named Duritakñaya, whose sons were Trayyäruëi, Kavi and Puñkaräruëi. Although these sons of Duritakñaya took birth in a dynasty of kñatriyas, they too attained the position of brähmaëas. Båhatkñatra had a son named Hasté, who established the city of Hastinäpura [now New Delhi].",
