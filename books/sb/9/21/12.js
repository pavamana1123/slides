    "synonyms": "na—not; kämaye—desire; aham—I; gatim—destination; éçvarät—from the Supreme Personality of Godhead; paräm—great; añöa-åddhi-yuktäm—composed of the eight kinds of mystic perfection; apunaù-bhavam—cessation of repeated birth (liberation, salvation); vä—either; ärtim—sufferings; prapadye—I accept; akhila-deha-bhäjäm—of all living entities; antaù-sthitaù—staying among them; yena—by which; bhavanti—they become; aduùkhäù—without distress.",
    "translation": "I do not pray to the Supreme Personality of Godhead for the eight perfections of mystic yoga, nor for salvation from repeated birth and death. I want only to stay among all the living entities and suffer all distresses on their behalf, so that they may be freed from suffering.",

Väsudeva Datta submitted that if they were unfit to be liberated, he himself would take all their sinful reactions and suffer personally so that the Lord might deliver them. A Vaiñëava is therefore described as being para-duùkha-duùkhé, very much aggrieved by the sufferings of others. As such, a Vaiñëava engages in activities for the real welfare of human society."
