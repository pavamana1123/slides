            "content": "\"The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brähmaëa, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste].\" A paëòita, or learned person, perceives the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being. Therefore, although it has now become fashionable to give preference to the so-called daridra-näräyaëa, or \"poor Näräyaëa,\" Rantideva had no reason to give preference to any one person. The idea that because Näräyaëa is present in the heart of one who is daridra, or poor, the poor man should be called daridra-näräyaëa is a wrong conception. By such logic, because the Lord is present within the hearts of the dogs and hogs, the dogs and hogs would also be Näräyaëa. One should not mistakenly think that Rantideva subscribed to this view. Rather, he saw everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (hari-sambandhi-vastunaù). It is not that everyone is the Supreme Godhead. Such a theory, which is propounded by the Mäyäväda philosophy, is always misleading, and Rantideva would never have accepted it."
