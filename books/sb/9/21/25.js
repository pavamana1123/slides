            "content": "The Çuka mentioned here is different from the Çukadeva Gosvämé who spoke Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Çukadeva Gosvämé, the son of Vyäsadeva, is described in great detail in the Brahma-vaivarta Puräëa. There it is said that Vyäsadeva maintained the daughter of Jäbäli as his wife and that after they performed penances together for many years, he placed his seed in her womb. The child remained in the womb of his mother for twelve years, and when the father asked the son to come out, the son replied that he would not come out unless he were completely liberated from the influence of mäyä. Vyäsadeva then assured the child that he would not be influenced by mäyä, but the child did not believe his father, for the father was still attached to his wife and children. Vyäsadeva then went to Dvärakä and informed the Personality of Godhead about his problem, and the Personality of Godhead, at Vyäsadeva's request, went to Vyäsadeva's cottage, where He assured the child in the womb that he would not be influenced by mäyä. Thus assured, the child came out, but he immediately went away as a parivräjakäcärya. When the father, very much aggrieved, began to follow his saintly boy, Çukadeva Gosvämé, the boy created a duplicate Çukadeva, who later entered family life. Therefore, the çuka-kanyä, or daughter of Çukadeva, mentioned in this verse is the daughter of the duplicate or imitation Çukadeva. The original Çukadeva was a lifelong brahmacäré."
