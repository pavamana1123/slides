But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.\" If one wants to be free from the influence of mäyä, the illusory energy, one must become Kåñëa conscious and always keep Kåñëa prominent within the core of his heart. In Bhagavad-gétä ). Because Rantideva was Kåñëa conscious, he was not under the influence of the illusory energy. The word svapnavat is significant in this connection. Because in the material world the mind is absorbed in materialistic activities, when one is asleep many contradictory activities appear in one's dreams. When one awakens, however, these activities automatically merge into the mind. Similarly, as long as one is under the influence of the material energy he makes many plans and schemes, but when one is Kåñëa conscious such dreamlike plans automatically disappear."
