            "content": "\"Of all yogés, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\" The best yogé is he who constantly thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the core of the heart. Because Rantideva was the king, the chief executive in the state, all the residents of the state became devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, by the king's transcendental association. This is the influence of a pure devotee. If there is one pure devotee, his association can create hundreds and thousands of pure devotees. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has said that a Vaiñëava is meritorious in proportion to the number of devotees he has created. A Vaiñëava becomes superior not simply by jugglery of words but by the number of devotees he has created for the Lord. Here the word rantidevänuvartinaù indicates that Rantideva's officers, friends, relatives and subjects all became first-class Vaiñëavas by his association. In other words, Rantideva is confirmed herein to be a first-class devotee, or mahä-bhägavata. Mahat-seväà dväram ähur vimukteù:  one should render service to such mahätmäs, for then one will automatically achieve the goal of liberation. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura has also said, chäòiyä vaiñëava-sevä nistära päyeche kebä: one cannot be liberated by his own effort, but if one becomes subordinate to a pure Vaiñëava, the door to liberation is open."
