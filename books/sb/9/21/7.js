    "translation": "Thereafter, having divided the remaining food with his relatives, Rantideva was just about to eat his own share when a çüdra guest arrived. Seeing the çüdra in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Rantideva gave him also a share of the food.",

Such equal vision is called sama-darçinaù (paëòitäù sama-darçinaù ). One who has actually realized that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone's heart and that every living being is part of the Lord does not make any distinction between the brähmaëa and the çüdra, the poor (daridra) and the rich (dhané). Such a person sees all living beings equally and treats them equally, without discrimination."
