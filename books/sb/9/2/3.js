Because Påñadhra was engaged in this way, it is to be understood that he had no dynasty. We can further understand from this vow accepted by Påñadhra how essential it is to protect the cows. Some son of a kñatriya would take this vow to protect the cows from ferocious animals, even at night. What then is to be said of sending cows to slaughterhouses? This is the most sinful activity in human society."
