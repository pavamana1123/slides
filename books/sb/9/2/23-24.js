The son of Näbhäga was known as Bhalandana, the son of Bhalandana was Vatsapréti, and his son was Präàçu. Präàçu's son was Pramati, Pramati's son was Khanitra, Khanitra's son was Cäkñuña, and his son was Viviàçati.",

            "content": "From Manu, one son became a kñatriya, another a brähmaëa, and another a vaiçya. This confirms the statement by Närada Muni, yasya yal lakñaëaà proktaà puàso varëäbhivyaïjakam ). So one is a brähmaëa, kñatriya or vaiçya never by birth, but by quality. There is a great need of brähmaëas. Therefore, in the Kåñëa consciousness movement, we are trying to train some brähmaëas to guide human society. Because at present there is a scarcity of brähmaëas, the brain of human society is lost. Because practically everyone is a çüdra, no one at the present moment can guide the members of society to the proper path by which to achieve perfection in life."
