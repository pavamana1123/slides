As the family priest or spiritual master of Påñadhra, Vasiñöha should have taken Påñadhra's offense very lightly, but instead Vasiñöha cursed him to become a çüdra. It is the duty of a family priest not to curse a disciple but to give him relief through the performance of some sort of atonement. Vasiñöha, however, did just the opposite. Therefore Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says that he was durmati; in other words, his intelligence was not very good."
