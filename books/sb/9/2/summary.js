            "content": "After Sudyumna accepted the order of vänaprastha and departed for the forest, Vaivasvata Manu, being desirous of sons, worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead and consequently begot ten sons like Mahäräja Ikñväku, all of whom were like their father. One of these sons, Påñadhra, was engaged in the duty of protecting cows at night with a sword in his hand. Following the order of his spiritual master, he would stand in this way for the entire night. Once, in the darkness of night, a tiger seized a cow from the cowshed, and when Påñadhra came to know this, he took a sword in his hand and followed the tiger. Unfortunately, when he finally approached the tiger, he could not distinguish between the cow and the tiger in the dark, and thus he killed the cow. Because of this, his spiritual master cursed him to take birth in a çüdra family, but Påñadhra practiced mystic yoga, and in bhakti-yoga he worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then he voluntarily entered a blazing forest fire, thus relinquishing his material body and going back home, back to Godhead."

            "content": "Kavi, the youngest son of Manu, was a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from his very childhood. From Manu's son known as Karüña, a sect of kñatriyas known as Kärüñas was generated. Manu also had a son known as Dhåñöa, from whom another sect of kñatriyas was generated, but although they were born of one who had the qualities of a kñatriya, they became brähmaëas. From Någa, another son of Manu, came the sons and grandsons known as Sumati, Bhütajyoti and Vasu. From Vasu, in succession, came Pratéka, and from him came Oghavän. Descending in order from the seminal dynasty of Nariñyanta, another son of Manu, were Citrasena, Åkña, Méòhvän, Pürëa, Indrasena, Vétihotra, Satyaçravä, Uruçravä, Devadatta and Agniveçya. From the kñatriya known as Agniveçya came the celebrated brähmaëa dynasty known as Ägniveçyäyana. From the seminal dynasty of Diñöa, another son of Manu, came Näbhäga, and from him in succession came Bhalandana, Vatsapréti, Präàçu, Pramati, Khanitra, Cäkñuña, Viviàçati, Rambha, Khanénetra, Karandhama, Avékñit, Marutta, Dama, Räjyavardhana, Sudhåti, Nara, Kevala, Dhundhumän, Vegavän, Budha and Tåëabindu. In this way, many sons and grandsons were born in this dynasty. From Tåëabindu came a daughter named Ilavilä, from whom Kuvera took birth. Tåëabindu also had three sons, named Viçäla, Çünyabandhu and Dhümraketu. The son of Viçäla was Hemacandra, his son was Dhümräkña, and his son was Saàyama. The sons of Saàyama were Devaja and Kåçäçva. Kåçäçva's son, Somadatta, performed an Açvamedha sacrifice, and by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, he achieved the supreme perfection of going back home, back to Godhead."
