The heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same to a devotee.\"  A devotee is always situated in the spiritual world. Therefore he does not desire anything. He is known as akäma, or desireless, because he has nothing to desire except to render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because Mahäräja Ambaréña was a most exalted devotee of the Lord, he trained his subjects in such a way that the citizens in his state were not interested in anything material, including even the happiness of the heavenly planets."
