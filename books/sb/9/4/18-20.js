    "translation": "Mahäräja Ambaréña always engaged his mind in meditating upon the lotus feet of Kåñëa, his words in describing the glories of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the Lord's temple, and his ears in hearing the words spoken by Kåñëa or about Kåñëa. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity of Kåñëa, Kåñëa's temples and Kåñëa's places like Mathurä and Våndävana, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of the Lord's devotees, he engaged his sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of tulasé offered to the Lord, and he engaged his tongue in tasting the Lord's prasäda. He engaged his legs in walking to the holy places and temples of the Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and all his desires in serving the Lord, twenty-four hours a day. Indeed, Mahäräja Ambaréña never desired anything for his own sense gratification. He engaged all his senses in devotional service, in various engagements related to the Lord. This is the way to increase attachment for the Lord and be completely free from all material desires.",

            "content": "In Bhagavad-gétä  bhakti means to engage the senses in the service of the master of the senses, Kåñëa, who is called Håñékeça or Acyuta. These words are used in these verses. Acyuta-sat-kathodaye, håñékeça-padäbhivandane. The words Acyuta and Håñékeça are also used in Bhagavad-gétä. Bhagavad-gétä is kåñëa-kathä spoken directly by Kåñëa, and Çrémad-Bhägavatam is also kåñëa-kathä because everything described in the Bhägavatam is in relationship with Kåñëa."
