    "translation": "O brähmaëa, let Me now advise you for your own protection. Please hear from Me. By offending Mahäräja Ambaréña, you have acted with self-envy. Therefore you should go to him immediately, without a moment's delay. One's so-called prowess, when employed against the devotee, certainly harms he who employs it. Thus it is the subject, not the object, who is harmed.",

To give a practical example, Hiraëyakaçipu was envious of Prahläda Mahäräja, but this envy of the devotee was harmful to Hiraëyakaçipu, not to Prahläda. Every action taken by Hiraëyakaçipu against his son Prahläda Mahäräja was taken very seriously by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus when Hiraëyakaçipu was on the verge of killing Prahläda, the Lord personally appeared and killed Hiraëyakaçipu. Service to a Vaiñëava gradually accumulates and becomes an asset for the devotee. Similarly, harmful activities directed against the devotee gradually become the ultimate cause of the performer's falldown. Even such a great brähmaëa and mystic yogé as Durväsä was in a most dangerous situation because of his offense at the lotus feet of Mahäräja Ambaréña, a pure devotee."
