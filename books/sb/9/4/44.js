            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has diverted the entire meaning of this verse as spoken by Durväsä Muni. Durväsä Muni used the word nå-çaàsasya to indicate that the King was cruel, but Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura interprets it to mean that the King's character was glorified by all the local people. He says that the word nå means \"by all the local people\" and that çaàsasya means \"of he (Ambaréña) whose character was glorified.\" Similarly, one who is very rich becomes mad because of his wealth and is therefore called çriyä-unmattasya, but Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura interprets these words to mean that although Mahäräja Ambaréña was such an opulent king, he was not mad after money, for he had already surpassed the madness of material opulence. Similarly, the word éça-mäninaù is interpreted to mean that he was so respectful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that he did not transgress the laws for observing Ekädaçé-päraëa, despite the thinking of Durväsä Muni, for he only took water. In this way, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has supported Ambaréña Mahäräja and all his activities."
