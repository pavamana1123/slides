In Näbhäga's absence, his brothers did not consider his share of the kingdom, but instead divided the property among themselves. When Näbhäga returned home, his brothers bestowed upon him their father as his share, but when Näbhäga went to his father and told him about the dealings of the brothers, his father informed him that this was cheating and advised him that for his livelihood he should go to the sacrificial arena and describe two mantras to be chanted there. Näbhäga executed the order of his father, and thus Aìgirä and other great saintly persons gave him all the money collected in that sacrifice. To test Näbhäga, Lord Çiva challenged his claim to the wealth, but when Lord Çiva was satisfied by Näbhäga's behavior, Lord Çiva offered him all the riches."

            "content": "From Näbhäga was born Ambaréña, the most powerful and celebrated devotee. Mahäräja Ambaréña was the emperor of the entire world, but he considered his opulence temporary. Indeed, knowing that such material opulence is the cause of downfall into conditional life, he was unattached to this opulence. He engaged his senses and mind in the service of the Lord. This process is called yukta-vairägya, or feasible renunciation, which is quite suitable for worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because Mahäräja Ambaréña, as the emperor, was immensely opulent, he performed devotional service with great opulence, and therefore, despite his wealth, he had no attachment to his wife, children or kingdom. He constantly engaged his senses and mind in the service of the Lord. Therefore, to say nothing of enjoying material opulence, he never desired even liberation."

            "content": "Once Mahäräja Ambaréña was worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Våndävana, observing the vow of Dvädaçé. On Dvädaçé, the day after Ekädaçé, when he was about to break his Ekädaçé fast, the great mystic yogé Durväsä appeared in his house and became his guest. King Ambaréña respectfully received Durväsä Muni, and Durväsä Muni, after accepting his invitation to eat there, went to bathe in the Yamunä River at noontime. Because he was absorbed in samädhi, he did not come back very soon. Mahäräja Ambaréña, however, upon seeing that the time to break the fast was passing, drank a little water, in accordance with the advice of learned brähmaëas, just to observe the formality of breaking the fast. By mystic power, Durväsä Muni could understand that this had happened, and he was very angry. When he returned he began to chastise Mahäräja Ambaréña, but he was not satisfied, and finally he created from his hair a demon appearing like the fire of death. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is always the protector of His devotee, and to protect Mahäräja Ambaréña, He sent His disc, the Sudarçana cakra, which immediately vanquished the fiery demon and then pursued Durväsä, who was so envious of Mahäräja Ambaréña. Durväsä fled to Brahmaloka, Çivaloka and all the other higher planets, but he could not protect himself from the wrath of the Sudarçana cakra. Finally he went to the spiritual world and surrendered to Lord Näräyaëa, but Lord Näräyaëa could not excuse a person who had offended a Vaiñëava. To be excused from such an offense, one must submit to the Vaiñëava whom he has offended. There is no other way to be excused. Thus Lord Näräyaëa advised Durväsä to return to Mahäräja Ambaréña and beg his pardon."
