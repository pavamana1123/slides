Therefore, offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee are serious. Caitanya Mahäprabhu has very strongly recommended that one not commit any offense at the lotus feet of a devotee. Such offenses are compared to a mad elephant because when a mad elephant enters a garden it causes devastation. Therefore one should be extremely careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of a pure devotee. Actually Mahäräja Ambaréña was not at all at fault; Durväsä Muni unnecessarily wanted to chastise him on flimsy grounds. Mahäräja Ambaréña wanted to complete the Ekädaçé-päraëa as part of devotional service to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he drank a little water. But although Durväsä Muni was a great mystic brähmaëa, he did not know what is what. That is the difference between a pure devotee and a so-called learned scholar of Vedic knowledge. The devotees, being always situated in the core of the Lord's heart, surely get all instructions directly from the Lord, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä :"

No one, therefore, should criticize a pure Vaiñëava. A Vaiñëava knows his own business; whatever he does is precisely right because he is always guided by the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
