    "translation": "The King said: \"To transgress the laws of respectful behavior toward the brähmaëas is certainly a great offense. On the other hand, if one does not observe the breaking of the fast within the time of Dvädaçé, there is a flaw in one's observance of the vow. Therefore, O brähmaëas, if you think that it will be auspicious and not irreligious, I shall break the fast by drinking water.\" In this way, after consulting with the brähmaëas, the King reached this decision, for according to brahminical opinion, drinking water may be accepted as eating and also as not eating.",

            "content": "When Mahäräja Ambaréña, in his dilemma, consulted the brähmaëas about whether he should break the fast or wait for Durväsä Muni, apparently they could not give a definite answer about what to do. A Vaiñëava, however, is the most intelligent personality. Therefore Mahäräja Ambaréña himself decided, in the presence of the brähmaëas, that he would drink a little water, for this would confirm that the fast was broken but would not transgress the laws for receiving a brähmaëa. In the Vedas it is said, apo 'çnäti tan naiväçitaà naivänaçitam. This Vedic injunction declares that the drinking of water may be accepted as eating or as not eating. Sometimes in our practical experience we see that some political leader adhering to satyägraha will not eat but will drink water. Considering that drinking water would not be eating, Mahäräja Ambaréña decided to act in this way."
