The Lord has given perfect advice in Bhagavad-gétä, and Ambaréña Mahäräja, as the ideal executive head, ruled the entire world as a Vaiñëava, taking advice from Vaiñëava brähmaëas. The çästras enjoin that even though a brähmaëa may be well versed in the occupational brahminical duties and may be very learned in Vedic knowledge, he cannot give advice as a guru until he is a Vaiñëava."

Such advisors or members of the legislative assembly should not be professional politicians, nor should they be selected by the ignorant public. Rather, they should be appointed by the king. When the king, the executive head of the state, is a devotee and he follows the instructions of devotee brähmaëas in ruling the country, everyone will be peaceful and prosperous. When the king and his advisors are perfect devotees, nothing can be wrong in the state. All the citizens should become devotees of the Lord, and then their good character will automatically follow."

This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material energy.\"  Citizens under the guidance of a Kåñëa conscious king will become devotees, and then there will be no need to enact new laws every day to reform the way of life in the state. If the citizens are trained to become devotees, they will automatically become peaceful and honest, and if they are guided by a devoted king advised by devotees, the state will not be in the material world but in the spiritual world. All the states of the world should therefore follow the ideal of the rule or administration of Mahäräja Ambaréña, as described here."
