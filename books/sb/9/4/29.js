Those interested in advancing in Kåñëa consciousness must observe Ekädaçé-vrata regularly. Mahäräja Ambaréña's queen was equally as qualified as the King. Therefore it was possible for Mahäräja Ambaréña to engage his life in household affairs. In this regard, the word tulya-çélayä is very significant. Unless a wife is equally as qualified as her husband, household affairs are very difficult to continue. Cäëakya Paëòita advises that a person in such a situation should immediately give up household life and become a vänaprastha or sannyäsé:"
