    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: The son of Nabhaga named Näbhäga lived for a long time at the place of his spiritual master. Therefore, his brothers thought that he was not going to become a gåhastha and would not return. Consequently, without providing a share for him, they divided the property of their father among themselves. When Näbhäga returned from the place of his spiritual master, they gave him their father as his share.",

One may return home, marry and become a householder, whereas the other, known as båhad-vrata, takes a vow to remain a brahmacäré perpetually. The båhad-vrata brahmacäré does not return from the place of the spiritual master; he stays there, and later he directly takes sannyäsa. Because Näbhäga did not return from the place of his spiritual master, his brothers thought that he had taken båhadvrata-brahmacarya. Therefore, they did not preserve his share, and when he returned they gave him their father as his share."
