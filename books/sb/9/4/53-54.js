    "translation": "Lord Brahmä said: At the end of the dvi-parärdha, when the pastimes of the Lord come to an end, Lord Viñëu, by a flick of His eyebrows, vanquishes the entire universe, including our places of residence. Such personalities as me and Lord Çiva, as well as Dakña, Bhågu and similar great saints of which they are the head, and also the rulers of the living entities, the rulers of human society and the rulers of the demigods—all of us surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viñëu, bowing our heads, to carry out His orders for the benefit of all living entities.",

In other words, all opulence, prestige and everything we possess is given by the Supreme Lord for some purpose. It is the duty of the surrendered soul to execute the orders of the Supreme. No one can disregard Him. Under the circumstances, Lord Brahmä refused to give shelter to Durväsä Muni from the powerful Sudarçana cakra sent by the Lord."
