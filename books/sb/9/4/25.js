    "translation": "Those who are saturated with the transcendental happiness of rendering service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead are uninterested even in the achievements of great mystics, for such achievements do not enhance the transcendental bliss felt by a devotee who always thinks of Kåñëa within the core of his heart.",

As far as the perfection of mystic powers is concerned, a devotee compares it to a venomous snake with no teeth. A mystic yogé is especially concerned with controlling the senses, but because the senses of a devotee are engaged in the service of the Lord (håñékeëa håñékeça-sevanaà bhaktir ucyate . A devotee's senses are not attracted by material enjoyment. And even though the material world is full of misery, the devotee considers this material world to be also spiritual because everything is engaged in the service of the Lord. The difference between the spiritual world and material world is the mentality of service. Nirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe yuktaà vairägyam ucyate. When there is no mentality of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one's activities are material."
