    "translation": "In desert countries where there flowed the River Sarasvaté, Mahäräja Ambaréña performed great sacrifices like the açvamedha-yajïa and thus satisfied the master of all yajïas, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such sacrifices were performed with great opulence and suitable paraphernalia and with contributions of dakñiëä to the brähmaëas, who were supervised by great personalities like Vasiñöha, Asita and Gautama, representing the king, the performer of the sacrifices.",

In Kali-yuga, however, there is a scarcity of such brähmaëas. Therefore in Kali-yuga the sacrifice recommended in çästra is saìkértana-yajïa (yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù ). The king or head of state must see that things go on well under proper guidance, and he must be an ideal devotee, as exemplified by Mahäräja Ambaréña. It is the duty of the king to see that food grains are produced even in desert countries, what to speak of elsewhere."
