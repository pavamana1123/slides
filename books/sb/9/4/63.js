    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said to the brähmaëa: I am completely under the control of My devotees. Indeed, I am not at all independent. Because My devotees are completely devoid of material desires, I sit only within the cores of their hearts. What to speak of My devotee, even those who are devotees of My devotee are very dear to Me.",

            "content": "All the great stalwart personalities in the universe, including Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, are fully under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is fully under the control of His devotee. Why is this? Because the devotee is anyäbhiläñitä-çünya; in other words, he has no material desires in his heart. His only desire is to think always of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and how to serve Him best. Because of this transcendental qualification, the Supreme Lord is extremely favorable to the devotees—indeed, not only the devotees, but also the devotees of the devotees. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, chäòiyä vaiñëava-sevä nistära päyeche kebä: without being a devotee of a devotee, one cannot be released from material entanglement. Therefore Caitanya Mahäprabhu identified Himself as gopé-bhartuù pada-kamalayor däsa-däsänudäsaù . Thus he instructed us to become not directly servants of Kåñëa but servants of the servant of Kåñëa. Devotees like Brahmä, Närada, Vyäsadeva and Çukadeva Gosvämé are directly servants of Kåñëa, and one who becomes a servant of Närada, Vyäsadeva and Çukadeva, like the six Gosvämés, is still more devoted. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura therefore says, yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädaù: if one very sincerely serves the spiritual master, Kåñëa certainly becomes favorable to such a devotee. Following the instructions of a devotee is more valuable than following the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly."
