Rather, everywhere he immediately sees manifest the form of the Supreme Lord.\" Although a devotee is within the material world, he has no connection with it. Nirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe. He accepts this material world in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee may be engaged in earning money, but he uses that money for propagating the Kåñëa consciousness movement by constructing large temples and establishing worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Khaöväìga Mahäräja, therefore, was not a materialist. A materialist is always attached to wife, children, home, property and many other things for sense gratification, but, as stated above, Khaöväìga Mahäräja was not attached to such things, nor could he think of anything existing without the purpose of the Supreme Lord. Éçäväsyam idaà sarvam:  everything is related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Of course, this consciousness is not for the ordinary person, but if one takes to the path of devotional service, as prescribed in The Nectar of Devotion, he can be trained in this consciousness and attain perfect understanding. For a Kåñëa conscious person, nothing is palatable without a relationship with Kåñëa."
