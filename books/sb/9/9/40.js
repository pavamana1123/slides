    "translation": "From Açmaka, Bälika took birth. Because Bälika was surrounded by women and was therefore saved from the anger of Paraçuräma, he was known as Närékavaca [\"one who is protected by women\"]. When Paraçuräma vanquished all the kñatriyas, Bälika became the progenitor of more kñatriyas. Therefore he was known as Mülaka, the root of the kñatriya dynasty.",
