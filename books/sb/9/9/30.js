    "translation": "My lord, you are completely aware of the religious principles. As a son never deserves to be killed by his father, here is a brähmaëa who should be protected by the king, and never killed. How does he deserve to be killed by a räjarñi like you?",

Because his duty is to rule the kingdom to maintain brahminical culture, he never desires to kill a brähmaëa. Generally, a brähmaëa, woman, child, old man or cow is never regarded as punishable. Thus the wife of the brähmaëa requested the King to refrain from this sinful act."
