Bhagératha, the son of Dilépa, was determined to bring the Ganges to the material world, and for this purpose he underwent severe austerities. Mother Ganges, being fully satisfied by his austerities, made herself visible to him, wanting to give him a benediction. Bhagératha then asked her to deliver his forefathers. Although mother Ganges agreed to come down to earth, she made two conditions: first, she wanted some suitable male to be able to control her waves; second, although all sinful men would be freed from sinful reactions by bathing in the Ganges, mother Ganges did not want to keep all these sinful reactions. These two conditions were subject matters for consideration. Bhagératha replied to mother Ganges, \"The Personality of Godhead Lord Çiva will be completely able to control the waves of your water, and when pure devotees bathe in your water, the sinful reactions left by sinful men will be counteracted.\" Bhagératha then performed austerities to satisfy Lord Çiva, who is called Äçutoña because he is naturally satisfied very easily. Lord Çiva agreed to Bhagératha's proposal to check the force of the Ganges. In this way, simply by the touch of the Ganges, Bhagératha's forefathers were delivered and allowed to go to the heavenly planets."

            "content": "The son of Bhagératha was Çruta, the son of Çruta was Näbha, and Näbha's son was Sindhudvépa. The son of Sindhudvépa was Ayutäyu, and the son of Ayutäyu was Åtüparëa, who was a friend of Nala. Åtüparëa gave Nala the art of gambling and learned from him the art of açva-vidyä. The son of Åtüparëa was known as Sarvakäma, the son of Sarvakäma was Sudäsa, and his son was Saudäsa. The wife of Saudäsa was named Damayanté or Madayanté, and Saudäsa was also known as Kalmäñapäda. Because of some defect in his fruitive activities, Saudäsa was cursed by Vasiñöha to become a Räkñasa. While walking through the forest, he saw a brähmaëa engaged in sex with his wife, and because he had become a Räkñasa he wanted to devour the brähmaëa. Although the brähmaëa's wife pleaded with him in many ways, Saudäsa devoured the brähmaëa, and the wife therefore cursed him, saying, \"As soon as you engage in sex you will die.\" After twelve years, therefore, even though Saudäsa was released from the curse of Vasiñöha Muni, he remained sonless. At that time, with Saudäsa's permission, Vasiñöha impregnated Saudäsa's wife, Madayanté. Because Madayanté bore the child for many years but still could not give birth, Vasiñöha struck her abdomen with a stone, and thus a son was born. The son was named Açmaka."

            "content": "The son of Açmaka was known as Bälika. He was protected from the curse of Paraçuräma because of being surrounded by many women, and therefore he is also known as Närékavaca. When the entire world was devoid of kñatriyas, he became the original father of more kñatriyas. He is therefore sometimes called Mülaka. From Bälika, Daçaratha was born, from Daçaratha came Aiòaviòi, and from Aiòaviòi came Viçvasaha. The son of Viçvasaha was Mahäräja Khaöväìga. Mahäräja Khaöväìga joined the demigods in fighting the demons and was victorious, and the demigods therefore wanted to give him a benediction. But when the King inquired how long he would live and understood that his life would last only a few seconds more, he immediately left the heavenly planets and returned to his own abode by airplane. He could understand that everything in this material world is insignificant, and thus he fully engaged in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari."
