Materialistic persons become attached to Lord Çiva because Lord Çiva bestows benedictions upon anyone and everyone very quickly, not caring to know how his devotees prosper or suffer. Although materialistic persons know that material happiness is nothing but another side of suffering, they want it, and to get it very quickly they worship Lord Çiva. We find that materialists are generally devotees of many demigods, especially Lord Çiva and mother Durgä. They do not actually want spiritual happiness, for it is almost unknown to them. But if one is serious about being happy spiritually, he must take shelter of Lord Viñëu, as the Lord personally demands:"
