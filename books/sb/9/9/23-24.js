    "translation": "When Vasiñöha understood that the human flesh had been served by the Räkñasa, not by the King, he undertook twelve years of austerity to cleanse himself for having cursed the faultless King. Meanwhile, King Saudäsa took water and chanted the çapa-mantra, preparing to curse Vasiñöha, but his wife, Madayanté, forbade him to do so. Then the King saw that the ten directions, the sky and the surface of the globe were full of living entities everywhere.",
