I offer my repeated obeisances to Govinda, who is the pleasure reservoir for all the senses.\" A devotee of Kåñëa is very much attached to brahminical culture. Indeed, an expert personality who knows who Kåñëa is and what He wants is a real brähmaëa. Brahma jänätéti brähmaëaù. Kåñëa is the Parabrahman, and therefore all Kåñëa conscious persons, or devotees of Kåñëa, are exalted brähmaëas. Khaöväìga Mahäräja regarded the devotees of Kåñëa as the real brähmaëas and the real light for human society. One who desires to advance in Kåñëa consciousness and spiritual understanding must give the utmost importance to brahminical culture and must understand Kåñëa (kåñëäya govindäya). Then his life will be successful."
