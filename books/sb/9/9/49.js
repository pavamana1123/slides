            "content": "The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases-as Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän. Bhagavän is the origin of everything. Brahman is a partial representation of Bhagavän, and Väsudeva, the Supersoul living everywhere and in everyone's heart, is also an advanced realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But when one comes to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead (väsudevaù sarvam iti), when one realizes that Väsudeva is both Paramätmä and the impersonal Brahman, he is then in perfect knowledge. Kåñëa is therefore described by Arjuna as paraà brahma paraà dhäma pavitraà paramaà bhavän , this means that the perfect devotee, after perfect realization, returns home, back to Godhead. Mahäräja Khaöväìga accepted the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because of his full surrender he achieved perfection."
