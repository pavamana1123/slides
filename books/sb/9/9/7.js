Similarly, Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, assumes the form of Lord Çiva for the special purpose of material transactions. I offer my obeisances at Lord Govinda's lotus feet.\" Lord Çiva is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the same sense that yogurt is also milk although at the same time it is not milk. For the maintenance of the material world there are three incarnations—Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara (Lord Çiva). Lord Çiva is Viñëu in an incarnation for the mode of ignorance. The material world exists predominantly in the mode of ignorance. Therefore Lord Çiva is compared here to the longitude and latitude of the entire universe, which resembles a cloth woven of threads extending for both its length and breadth."
