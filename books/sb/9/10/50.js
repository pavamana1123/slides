            "content": "People are very fond of the pattern of Räma-räjya, and even today politicians sometimes form a party called Räma-räjya, but unfortunately they have no obedience to Lord Räma. It is sometimes said that people want the kingdom of God without God. Such an aspiration, however, is never to be fulfilled. Good government can exist when the relationship between the citizens and the government is like that exemplified by Lord Rämacandra and His citizens. Lord Rämacandra ruled His kingdom exactly as a father takes care of his children, and the citizens, being obliged to the good government of Lord Rämacandra, accepted the Lord as their father. Thus the relationship between the citizens and the government should be exactly like that between father and son. When the sons in a family are well trained, they are obedient to the father and mother, and when the father is well qualified, he takes good care of the children. As indicated here by the words sva-dharma-niratä varëäçrama-guëän-vitäù, the people were good citizens because they accepted the institution of varëa and äçrama, which arranges society in the varëa divisions of brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra and the äçrama divisions of brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. This is actual human civilization. People must be trained according to the different varëäçrama occupational duties. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä . The entire varëäçrama scheme is intended to enable people to become Vaiñëavas. Viñëur asya devatä. When people worship Lord Viñëu as the Supreme Lord, they become Vaiñëavas. Thus people should be trained to become Vaiñëavas through the system of varëa and äçrama, as they were during the reign of Lord Rämacandra, when everyone was fully trained to follow the varëäçrama principles."

            "content": "Simply enforcing laws and ordinances cannot make the citizens obedient and lawful. That is impossible. Throughout the entire world there are so many states, legislative assemblies and parliaments, but still the citizens are rogues and thieves. Good citizenship, therefore, cannot be enforced; the citizens must be trained. As there are schools and colleges to train students to become chemical engineers, lawyers or specialists in many other departments of knowledge, there must be schools and colleges to train students to become brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas, çüdras, brahmacärés, gåhasthas, vänaprasthas and sannyäsés. This will provide the preliminary condition for good citizenship (varëäçrama-guëän-vitäù). Generally speaking, if the king or president is a räjarñi, the relationship between the citizens and the chief executive will be clear, and there will be no possibility of disruption in the state, because the number of thieves and rogues will decrease. In Kali-yuga, however, because the varëäçrama system is neglected, people are generally thieves and rogues. In the system of democracy, such thieves and rogues naturally collect money from other thieves and rogues, and thus there is chaos in every government, and no one is happy. But here the example of good government is to be found in the reign of Lord Rämacandra. If people follow this example, there will be good government all over the world."
