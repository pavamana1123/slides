    "translation": "After entering Laìkä, the monkey soldiers, led by chiefs like Sugréva, Néla and Hanumän, occupied all the sporting houses, granaries, treasuries, palace doorways, city gates, assembly houses, palace frontages and even the resting houses of the pigeons. When the city's crossroads, platforms, flags and golden waterpots on its domes were all destroyed, the entire city of Laìkä appeared like a river disturbed by a herd of elephants.",
