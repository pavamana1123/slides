The son of Raghu was Aja, the son of Aja was Daçaratha, and the son of Daçaratha was Lord Rämacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the Lord descended into this world in His full quadruple expansion-as Lord Rämacandra, Lakñmaëa, Bharata and Çatrughna-great sages like Välméki who were actually in knowledge of the Absolute Truth described His transcendental pastimes. Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé describes these pastimes in brief."

            "content": "Lord Rämacandra went with Viçvämitra and killed Räkñasas like Märéca. After breaking the stout and strong bow known as Haradhanu, the Lord married mother Sétä and cut down the prestige of Paraçuräma. To obey the order of His father, He entered the forest, accompanied by Lakñmaëa and Sétä. There He cut off the nose of Çürpaëakhä and killed the associates of Rävaëa, headed by Khara and Düñaëa. Rävaëa's kidnapping of Sétädevé was the beginning of this demon's misfortune. When Märéca assumed the form of a golden deer, Lord Rämacandra went to bring the deer to please Sétädevé, but in the meantime Rävaëa took advantage of the Lord's absence to kidnap her. When Sétädevé was kidnapped, Lord Rämacandra, accompanied by Lakñmaëa, searched for her throughout the forest. In the course of this search, They met Jaöäyu. Then the Lord killed the demon Kabandha and the commander Väli and established a friendly relationship with Sugréva. After organizing the military strength of the monkeys and going with them to the shore of the sea, the Lord awaited the arrival of Samudra, the ocean personified, but when Samudra did not come, the Lord, the master of Samudra, became angry. Then Samudra came to the Lord with great haste and surrendered to Him, wanting to help Him in every way. The Lord then attempted to bridge the ocean, and, with the help of advice from Vibhéñaëa, He attacked Rävaëa's capital, Laìkä. Previously, Hanumän, the eternal servant of the Lord, had set fire to Laìkä, and now, with the help of Lakñmaëa, the forces of Lord Rämacandra killed all the Räkñasa soldiers. Then Lord Rämacandra personally killed Rävaëa. Mandodaré and other wives lamented for Rävaëa, and in accordance with Lord Rämacandra's order, Vibhéñaëa performed the funeral ceremonies for all the dead in the family. Lord Rämacandra then gave Vibhéñaëa the right to rule Laìkä and also granted him a long duration of life. The Lord delivered Sétädevé from the Açoka forest and carried her in a flower airplane to His capital Ayodhyä, where He was received by His brother Bharata. When Lord Rämacandra entered Ayodhyä, Bharata brought His wooden shoes, Vibhéñaëa and Sugréva held a whisk and fan, Hanumän carried an umbrella, Çatrughna carried the Lord's bow and two quivers, and Sétädevé carried a waterpot containing water from holy places. Aìgada carried a sword, and Jämbavän (Åkñaräja) carried a shield. After Lord Rämacandra, accompanied by Lord Lakñmaëa and mother Sétädevé, met all His relatives, the great sage Vasiñöha enthroned Him as King. The chapter ends with a short description of Lord Rämacandra's rule in Ayodhyä."
