    "translation": "Thereafter, having been welcomed by His brother Bharata, Lord Rämacandra entered the city of Ayodhyä in the midst of a festival. When He entered the palace, He offered obeisances to all the mothers, including Kaikeyé and the other wives of Mahäräja Daçaratha, and especially His own mother, Kauçalyä. He also offered obeisances to the spiritual preceptors, such as Vasiñöha. Friends of His own age and younger friends worshiped Him, and He returned their respectful obeisances, as did Lakñmaëa and mother Sétä. In this way they all entered the palace.",
