But those who are learned and spiritually advanced will never accept such notions; they will accept the descriptions of Lord Rämacandra and His activities only as presented by tattva-darçés, those who know the Absolute Truth.

The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\" Unless one is tattva-darçé, in complete knowledge of the Absolute Truth, one cannot describe the activities of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore although there are many so-called Rämäyaëas, or histories of Lord Rämacandra's activities, some of them are not actually authoritative. Sometimes Lord Rämacandra's activities are described in terms of one's own imaginations, speculations or material sentiments. But the characteristics of Lord Rämacandra should not be handled as something imaginary. While describing the history of Lord Rämacandra, Çukadeva Gosvämé told Mahäräja Parékñit, \"You have already heard about the activities of Lord Rämacandra.\" Apparently, therefore, five thousand years ago there were many Rämäyaëas, or histories of Lord Rämacandra's activities, and there are many still. But we must select only those books written by tattva-darçés (jïäninas tattva-darçinaù ), not the books of so-called scholars who claim knowledge only on the basis of a doctorate. This is a warning by Çukadeva Gosvämé. Åñibhis tattva-darçibhiù. Although the Rämäyaëa composed by Välméki is a huge literature, the same activities are summarized here by Çukadeva Gosvämé in a few verses."
