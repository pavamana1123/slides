Kaikeyé, however, said that she would ask for the benediction when it was necessary. At the time of the coronation of Prince Rämacandra, Kaikeyé requested her husband to enthrone her son Bharata and send Rämacandra to the forest. Mahäräja Daçaratha, being bound by his promise, ordered Rämacandra to go to the forest, according to the dictation of his beloved. And the Lord, as an obedient son, accepted the order immediately. He left everything without hesitation, just as a liberated soul or great yogé gives up his life without material attraction."
