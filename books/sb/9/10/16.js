    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: After constructing a bridge over the ocean by throwing into the water the peaks of mountains whose trees and other vegetation had been shaken by the hands of great monkeys, Lord Rämacandra went to Laìkä to release Sétädevé from the clutches of Rävaëa. With the direction and help of Vibhéñaëa, Rävaëa's brother, the Lord, along with the monkey soldiers, headed by Sugréva, Néla and Hanumän, entered Rävaëa's kingdom, Laìkä, which had previously been burnt by Hanumän.",

By the supreme will of the Lord, many great planets float weightlessly in space like swabs of cotton. If this is possible, why should great mountain peaks not be able to float on water? This is the omnipotence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He can do anything and everything He likes, because He is not under the control of the material nature; indeed, material nature is controlled by Him. Mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sacaräcaram:  only under His direction does prakåti, or material nature, work. Similar information is given in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38):"

Consequently, for Lord Rämacandra to construct a bridge over the Indian Ocean with the help of monkey soldiers who threw great mountain peaks into the water is not at all wonderful; it is wonderful only in the sense that it has kept the name and fame of Lord Rämacandra eternally celebrated."
