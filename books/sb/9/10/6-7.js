    "translation": "O King, the pastimes of Lord Rämacandra were wonderful, like those of a baby elephant. In the assembly where mother Sétä was to choose her husband, in the midst of the heroes of this world, He broke the bow belonging to Lord Çiva. This bow was so heavy that it was carried by three hundred men, but Lord Rämacandra bent and strung it and broke it in the middle, just as a baby elephant breaks a stick of sugarcane. Thus the Lord achieved the hand of mother Sétä, who was equally as endowed with transcendental qualities of form, beauty, behavior, age and nature. Indeed, she was the goddess of fortune who constantly rests on the chest of the Lord. While returning from Sétä's home after gaining her at the assembly of competitors, Lord Rämacandra met Paraçuräma. Although Paraçuräma was very proud, having rid the earth of the royal order twenty-one times, he was defeated by the Lord, who appeared to be a kñatriya of the royal order.",
