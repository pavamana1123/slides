            "content": "\"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.\" Thus the destination of godless atheists such as Rävaëa, Hiraëyakaçipu, Kaàsa and Dantavakra is a hellish condition of life. Mandodaré, the wife of Rävaëa, could understand all this because she was a chaste woman. Although lamenting for the death of her husband, she knew what would happen to his body and soul, for although one cannot see directly with one's material eyes, one can see with eyes of knowledge (paçyanti jïäna-cakñuñaù). In Vedic history there are many instances of how one becomes godless and is condemned by the laws of nature."
