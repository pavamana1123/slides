A similar situation could be introduced immediately, even in this age called Kali, the worst of all ages. It is said, kali-käle näma-rüpe kåñëa-avatära: Kåñëa descends in this Kali-yuga in the form of His holy name—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Räma. If we chant offenselessly, Räma and Kåñëa are still present in this age. The kingdom of Räma was immensely popular and beneficial, and the spreading of this Hare Kåñëa movement can immediately introduce a similar situation, even in this Kali-yuga."
