Advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam (BS 5.33). Although they are one and the same, viñëu-tattva has many forms and incarnations. As confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38), rämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan. The Lord is situated in many forms, such as Räma, Lakñmaëa, Bharata and Çatrughna, and these forms may exist in any part of His creation. All these forms exist permanently, eternally, as individual Personalities of Godhead, and they resemble many candles, all equally powerful. Lord Rämacandra, Lakñmaëa, Bharata and Çatrughna, who, being viñëu-tattva, are all equally powerful, became the sons of Mahäräja Daçaratha in response to prayers by the demigods."
