To save a deceased person from ghostly life, the funeral ceremony, or çräddha ceremony, as prescribed in authorized çästra, must be performed. Rävaëa was killed by Lord Rämacandra and was destined for hellish life, but by Lord Rämacandra's advice, Vibhéñaëa, Rävaëa's brother, performed all the duties prescribed in relation to the dead. Thus Lord Rämacandra was kind to Rävaëa even after Rävaëa's death."
