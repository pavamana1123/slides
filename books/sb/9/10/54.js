    "translation": "Lord Rämacandra took a vow to accept only one wife and have no connection with any other women. He was a saintly king, and everything in His character was good, untinged by qualities like anger. He taught good behavior for everyone, especially for householders, in terms of varëäçrama-dharma. Thus He taught the general public by His personal activities.",

            "content": "Eka-patné-vrata, accepting only one wife, was the glorious example set by Lord Rämacandra. One should not accept more than one wife. In those days, of course, people did marry more than one wife. Even Lord Rämacandra's father accepted more wives than one. But Lord Rämacandra, as an ideal king, accepted only one wife, mother Sétä. When mother Sétä was kidnapped by Rävaëa and the Räkñasas, Lord Rämacandra, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could have married hundreds and thousands of Sétäs, but to teach us how faithful He was to His wife, He fought with Rävaëa and finally killed him. The Lord punished Rävaëa and rescued His wife to instruct men to have only one wife. Lord Rämacandra accepted only one wife and manifested sublime character, thus setting an example for householders. A householder should live according to the ideal of Lord Rämacandra, who showed how to be a perfect person. Being a householder or living with a wife and children is never condemned, provided one lives according to the regulative principles of varëäçrama-dharma. Those who live in accordance with these principles, whether as householders, brahmacärés or vänaprasthas, are all equally important."
