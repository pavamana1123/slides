There are many instances of this in the history of Vedic literature. Whenever we find a description of ideal chaste women, mother Sétä is among them. Mandodaré, the wife of Rävaëa, was also very chaste. Similarly, Draupadé was one of five exalted chaste women. As a man must follow great personalities like Brahmä and Närada, a woman must follow the path of such ideal women as Sétä, Mandodaré and Draupadé. By staying chaste and faithful to her husband, a woman enriches herself with supernatural power. It is a moral principle that one should not be influenced by lusty desires for another's wife. Mätåvat para-däreñu: an intelligent person must look upon another's wife as being like his mother. This is a moral injunction from Cäëakya-çloka (10)."

Because she was a chaste woman, she knew the power of another chaste woman, especially such a wife as mother Sétädevé."
