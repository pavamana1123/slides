    "translation": "My Lord, You may use my water as You like. Indeed, You may cross it and go to the abode of Rävaëa, who is the great source of disturbance and crying for the three worlds. He is the son of Viçravä, but is condemned like urine. Please go kill him and thus regain Your wife, Sétädevé. O great hero, although my water presents no impediment to Your going to Laìkä, please construct a bridge over it to spread Your transcendental fame. Upon seeing this wonderfully uncommon deed of Your Lordship, all the great heroes and kings in the future will glorify You.",

When a son is a devotee or a great learned person, the seminal discharge for begetting a son is successful, but if the son is unqualified and brings no glory to his family, he is no better than urine. Here Rävaëa is compared to urine because he was a cause of disturbances to the three worlds. Thus the ocean personified wanted him killed by Lord Rämacandra."

The Lord can act without regard to material impediments or inconveniences, but to prove that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and was not merely advertised as Godhead or elected by popular vote, He constructed a wonderful bridge over the ocean. Nowadays it has become fashionable to create some artificial God who performs no uncommon activities; a little magic will bewilder a foolish person into selecting an artificial God because he does not understand how powerful God is. Lord Rämacandra, however, constructed a bridge over the water with stone by making the stone float. This is proof of God's uncommonly wonderful power. Why should someone be accepted as God without displaying extraordinary potency by doing something never to be done by any common man? We accept Lord Rämacandra as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He constructed this bridge, and we accept Lord Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He lifted Govardhana Hill when He was only seven years old. We should not accept any rascal as God or an incarnation of God, for God displays special features in His various activities. Therefore, the Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gétä :"

The symptoms of the Lord's activities are all mentioned in the çästras, and after one understands them one can accept the Lord as He is."
