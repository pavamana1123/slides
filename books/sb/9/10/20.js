    "translation": "Aìgada and the other commanders of the soldiers of Rämacandra faced the elephants, infantry, horses and chariots of the enemy and hurled against them big trees, mountain peaks, clubs and arrows. Thus the soldiers of Lord Rämacandra killed Rävaëa's soldiers, who had lost all good fortune because Rävaëa had been condemned by the anger of mother Sétä.",

            "content": "The soldiers Lord Rämacandra recruited in the jungle were all monkeys and did not have proper equipment with which to fight the soldiers of Rävaëa, for Rävaëa's soldiers were equipped with weapons of modern warfare whereas the monkeys could only throw stones, mountain peaks and trees. It was only Lord Rämacandra and Lakñmaëa who shot some arrows. But because the soldiers of Rävaëa were condemned by the curse of mother Sétä, the monkeys were able to kill them simply by throwing stones and trees. There are two kinds of strength—daiva and puruñäkära. Daiva refers to the strength achieved from the Transcendence, and puruñäkära refers to the strength organized by one's own intelligence and power. Transcendental power is always superior to the power of the materialist. Depending on the mercy of the Supreme Lord, one must fight one's enemies even though one may not be equipped with modern weapons. Therefore Kåñëa instructed Arjuna, mäm anusmara yudhya ca:  \"Think of Me and fight.\" We should fight our enemy to the best of our ability, but for victory we must depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
