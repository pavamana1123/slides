    "translation": "When Rämacandra entered the forest and Lakñmaëa was also absent, the worst of the Räkñasas, Rävaëa, kidnapped Sétädevé, the daughter of the King of Videha, just as a tiger seizes unprotected sheep when the shepherd is absent. Then Lord Rämacandra wandered in the forest with His brother Lakñmaëa as if very much distressed due to separation from His wife. Thus He showed by His personal example the condition of a person attached to women.",

According to moral instructions, gåhe näréà vivarjayet: when one goes on a tour, one should not bring his wife. Formerly men used to travel without conveyances, but still, as far as possible, when one leaves home one should not take his wife with him, especially if one is in such a condition as Lord Rämacandra when banished by the order of His father. Whether in the forest or at home, if one is attached to women this attachment is always troublesome, as shown by the Supreme Personality of Godhead by His personal example."

            "content": "Of course, this is the material side of stré-saìgé, but the situation of Lord Rämacandra is spiritual, for He does not belong to the material world. Näräyaëaù paro 'vyaktät: Näräyaëa is beyond the material creation. Because He is the creator of the material world, He is not subject to the conditions of the material world. The separation of Lord Rämacandra from Sétä is spiritually understood as vipralambha, which is an activity of the hlädiné potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead belonging to the çåìgära-rasa, the mellow of conjugal love in the spiritual world. In the spiritual world the Supreme Personality of Godhead has all the dealings of love, displaying the symptoms called sättvika, saïcäré, viläpa, mürcchä and unmäda. Thus when Lord Rämacandra was separated from Sétä, all these spiritual symptoms were manifested. The Lord is neither impersonal nor impotent. Rather, He is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1), the eternal form of knowledge and bliss. Thus He has all the symptoms of spiritual bliss. Feeling separation from one's beloved is also an item of spiritual bliss. As explained by Çréla Svarüpa Dämodara Gosvämé, rädhä-kåñëa-praëaya-vikåtir hlädiné-çaktiù: the dealings of love between Rädhä and Kåñëa are displayed as the pleasure potency of the Lord. The Lord is the original source of all pleasure, the reservoir of all pleasure. Lord Rämacandra, therefore, manifested the truth both spiritually and materially. Materially those who are attached to women suffer, but spiritually when there are feelings of separation between the Lord and His pleasure potency the spiritual bliss of the Lord increases. This is further explained in Bhagavad-gétä :"

Here the words vaideha-räja-duhitari indicate that before mother Sétä was married to Lord Rämacandra she was protected by her father, Vaideha-räja. And when she was married she was protected by her husband. Therefore the conclusion is that a woman should always be protected. According to the Vedic rule, there is no scope for a woman's being independent (asamakñam), for a woman cannot protect herself independently."
