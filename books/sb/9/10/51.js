Anyone, anywhere, can easily take to this Hare Kåñëa movement; one need only chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, observe the rules and regulations, and stay free from the contamination of sinful life. Even if one is sinful and cannot give up sinful life immediately, if he chants the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra with devotion and faith he will certainly be freed from all sinful activities, and his life will be successful. Paraà vijayate çré-kåñëa-saìkértanam. This is the blessing of Lord Rämacandra, who has appeared in this age of Kali as Lord Gaurasundara."
