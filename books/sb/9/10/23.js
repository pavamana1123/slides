    "translation": "After thus rebuking Rävaëa, Lord Rämacandra fixed an arrow to His bow, aimed at Rävaëa, and released the arrow, which pierced Rävaëa's heart like a thunderbolt. Upon seeing this, Rävaëa's followers raised a tumultuous sound, crying, \"Alas! Alas! What has happened? What has happened?\" as Rävaëa, vomiting blood from his ten mouths, fell from his airplane, just as a pious man falls to earth from the heavenly planets when the results of his pious activities are exhausted.",
