    "translation": "When the demigod named Båhaspati was attracted by his brother's wife, Mamatä, who at that time was pregnant, he desired to have sexual relations with her. The son within her womb forbade this, but Båhaspati cursed him and forcibly discharged semen into the womb of Mamatä.",

This can happen even in the society of the higher demigods, so what to speak of human society? The sex impulse is so strong that it can agitate even a learned personality like Båhaspati."
