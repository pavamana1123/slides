            "content": "In her reception of Mahäräja Duñmanta, Çakuntalä clearly said, \"Your Majesty may stay here, and you may accept whatever reception I can offer.\" Thus she indicated that she wanted Mahäräja Duñmanta as her husband. As far as Mahäräja Duñmanta was concerned, he desired Çakuntalä as his wife from the very beginning, as soon as he saw her, so the agreement to unite as husband and wife was natural. To induce Çakuntalä to accept the marriage, Mahäräja Duñmanta reminded her that as the daughter of a king she could select her husband in an open assembly. In the history of Äryan civilization there have been many instances in which famous princesses have selected their husbands in open competitions. For example, it was in such a competition that Sétädevé accepted Lord Rämacandra as her husband and that Draupadé accepted Arjuna, and there are many other instances. So marriage by agreement or by selecting one's own husband in an open competition is allowed. There are eight kinds of marriage, of which marriage by agreement is called gändharva marriage. Generally the parents select the husband or wife for their daughter or son, but gändharva marriage takes place by personal selection. Still, although marriage by personal selection or by agreement took place in the past, we find no such thing as divorce by disagreement. Of course, divorce by disagreement took place among low-class men, but marriage by agreement was found even in the very highest classes, especially in the royal kñatriya families. Mahäräja Duñmanta's acceptance of Çakuntalä as his wife was sanctioned by Vedic culture. How the marriage took place is described in the next verse."
