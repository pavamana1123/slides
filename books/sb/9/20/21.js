The mother is simply like a storekeeper, because the seed of the child is placed in her womb, but it is the father who is responsible for maintaining the son. In Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says that He is the seed-giving father of all living entities (ahaà béja-pradaù pitä  the Lord also says, béjaà mäà sama-bhütänäm: \"I am the seed of all living entities.\" A particular type of seed is sown within the earth, and then a particular type of tree or plant comes out. The mother resembles the earth, and when a particular type of seed is sown by the father, a particular type of body takes birth."
