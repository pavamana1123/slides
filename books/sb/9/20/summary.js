Raudräçva had ten sons-Åteyu, Kakñeyu, Sthaëòileyu, Kåteyuka, Jaleyu, Sannateyu, Dharmeyu, Satyeyu, Vrateyu and Vaneyu. The son of Åteyu was Rantinäva, who had three sons-Sumati, Dhruva and Apratiratha. The son of Apratiratha was Kaëva, and Kaëva's son was Medhätithi. The sons of Medhätithi, headed by Praskanna, were all brähmaëas. The son of Rantinäva named Sumati had a son named Rebhi, and his son was Duñmanta."

That woman was the daughter of Viçvämitra, and her name was Çakuntalä. Her mother was Menakä, who had left her in the forest, where Kaëva Muni found her. Kaëva Muni brought her to his äçrama, where he raised and maintained her. When Çakuntalä accepted Mahäräja Duñmanta as her husband, he married her according to the gändharva-vidhi. Çakuntalä later became pregnant by her husband, who left her in the äçrama of Kaëva Muni and returned to his kingdom."

            "content": "In due course of time, Çakuntalä gave birth to a Vaiñëava son, but Duñmanta, having returned to the capital, forgot what had taken place. Therefore, when Çakuntalä approached him with her newly born child, Mahäräja Duñmanta refused to accept them as his wife and son. Later, however, after a mysterious omen, the King accepted them. After Mahäräja Duñmanta's death, Bharata, the son of Çakuntalä, was enthroned. He performed many great sacrifices, in which he gave great riches in charity to the brähmaëas. This chapter ends by describing the birth of Bharadväja and how Mahäräja Bharata accepted Bharadväja as his son."
