    "translation": "Mahäräja Bharata, the son of Duñmanta, had the mark of Lord Kåñëa's disc on the palm of his right hand, and he had the mark of a lotus whorl on the soles of his feet. By worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead with a grand ritualistic ceremony, he became the emperor and master of the entire world. Then, under the priesthood of Mämateya, Bhågu Muni, he performed fifty-five horse sacrifices on the bank of the Ganges, beginning from its mouth and ending at its source, and seventy-eight horse sacrifices on the bank of the Yamunä, beginning from the confluence at Prayäga and ending at the source. He established the sacrificial fire on an excellent site, and he distributed great wealth to the brähmaëas. Indeed, he distributed so many cows that each of thousands of brähmaëas had one badva [13,084] as his share.",

As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , yajïärthät karmaëo 'nyatra loko 'yaà karma-bandhanaù: \"Work done as a sacrifice for Viñëu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world.\" Everyone should engage in the performance of yajïa, and the sacrificial fire should be ignited everywhere, the entire purpose being to make people happy, prosperous and progressive in spiritual life. Of course, these things were possible before the beginning of Kali-yuga because there were qualified brähmaëas who could perform such yajïas. For the present, however, the Brahma-vaivarta Puräëa enjoins:"

This verse says, mämateyaà purodhäya: Mahäräja Bharata engaged the son of Mamatä, Bhågu Muni, to take charge of performing this yajïa. Now, however, such brähmaëas are impossible to find. Therefore the çästras recommend, yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù: those who are intelligent should perform the saìkértana-yajïa inaugurated by Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu."

In conclusion, therefore, in this age of Kali people all over the world should refrain from the four principles of sinful life-illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling-and in a pure state of existence should perform the simple yajïa of chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. Then the earth will certainly produce all the necessities for life, and people will be happy economically, politically, socially, religiously and culturally. Everything will be in proper order."
