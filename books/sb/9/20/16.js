    "synonyms": "om iti ukte—by reciting the Vedic praëava, invoking the Supreme Personality of Godhead to witness the marriage; yathä-dharmam—exactly according to the principles of religion (because Näräyaëa becomes the witness in an ordinary religious marriage also); upayeme—he married; çakuntaläm—the girl Çakuntalä; gändharva-vidhinä—by the regulative principle of the Gandharvas, without deviation from religious principles; räjä—Mahäräja Duñmanta; deça-käla-vidhäna-vit—completely aware of duties according to time, position and objective.",
    "translation": "When Çakuntalä responded to Mahäräja Duñmanta's proposal with silence, the agreement was complete. Then the King, who knew the laws of marriage, immediately married her by chanting the Vedic praëava [oàkära], in accordance with the marriage ceremony as performed among the Gandharvas.",

            "content": "The oàkära, praëava, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead represented by letters. Bhagavad-gétä says that the letters a-u-m, combined together as oà, represent the Supreme Lord. Religious principles are meant to invoke the blessings and mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, who says in Bhagavad-gétä that He is personally present in sexual desires that are not contrary to religious principles. The word vidhinä means, \"according to religious principles.\" The association of men and women according to religious principles is allowed in the Vedic culture. In our Kåñëa consciousness movement we allow marriage on the basis of religious principles, but the sexual combination of men and women as friends is irreligious and is not allowed."
