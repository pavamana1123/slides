The Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gétä , cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù: \"According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me.\" Therefore, regardless of the family in which one takes birth, when one is qualified with the symptoms of a particular section, he is to be described accordingly. Yal-lakñaëaà proktam. One's place in the varëa divisions of society is determined according to one's symptoms or qualities. This is maintained everywhere in the çästra. Birth is a secondary consideration; the first consideration is one's qualities and activities."
