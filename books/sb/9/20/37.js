            "content": "According to Vedic scripture, whenever a child is born there are some ceremonies known as jäta-karma and näma-karaëa, in which learned brähmaëas, immediately after the birth of the child, make a horoscope according to astrological calculations. But the child to which Mamatä gave birth was begotten by Båhaspati irreligiously, for although Mamatä was the wife of Utathya, Båhaspati made her pregnant by force. Therefore Båhaspati became bhartä. According to Vedic culture, a wife is considered the property of her husband, and a son born by illicit sex is called dväja. The common word still current in Hindu society for such a son is doglä, which refers to a son not begotten by the husband of his mother. In such a situation, it is difficult to give the child a name according to proper regulative principles. Mamatä, therefore, was perplexed, but the demigods gave the child the appropriate name Bharadväja, which indicated that the child born illegitimately should be maintained by both Mamatä and Båhaspati."
