            "content": "The word gotrajaù is significant in this connection. Brähmaëas generally act as spiritual masters of two dynasties. One is their disciplic succession, and the other is the dynasty born of their semen. Both descendants belong to the same gotra, or dynasty. In the Vedic system we sometimes find that both brähmaëas and kñatriyas and even vaiçyas come in the disciplic succession of the same åñis. Because the gotra and dynasty are one, there is no difference between the disciples and the family born of the semen. The same system still prevails in Indian society, especially in regard to marriage, for which the gotra is calculated. Here the word gotrajaù refers to those born in the same dynasty, whether they be disciples or members of the family."
