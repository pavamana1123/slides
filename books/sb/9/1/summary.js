While describing this dynasty, he also described how the Supreme Personality of Godhead, while lying down in the waters of devastation, gave birth to Lord Brahmä from a lotus generated from His navel. From the mind of Lord Brahmä, Maréci was generated, and his son was Kaçyapa. From Kaçyapa, through Aditi, Vivasvän was generated, and from Vivasvän came Çräddhadeva Manu, who was born from the womb of Saàjïä. Çräddhadeva's wife, Çraddhä, gave birth to ten sons, such as Ikñväku and Någa."

Then, although Vaivasvata Manu wanted a son, by the desire of his wife he got a daughter named Ilä. Manu, however, was not satisfied with the daughter. Consequently, for Manu's satisfaction, the great sage Vasiñöha prayed for Ilä to be transformed into a boy, and his prayer was fulfilled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Ilä became a beautiful young man named Sudyumna."

            "content": "Once upon a time, Sudyumna went on tour with his ministers. At the foot of the mountain Sumeru there is a forest named Sukumära, and as soon as they entered that forest, they were all transformed into women. When Mahäräja Parékñit inquired from Çukadeva Gosvämé about the reason for this transformation, Çukadeva Gosvämé described how Sudyumna, being transformed into a woman, accepted Budha, the son of the moon, as her husband and had a son named Purüravä. By the grace of Lord Çiva, Sudyumna received the benediction that he would live one month as a woman and one month as a man. Thus he regained his kingdom and had three sons, named Utkala, Gaya and Vimala, who were all very religious. Thereafter, he entrusted his kingdom to Purüravä and took the order of vänaprastha life."
