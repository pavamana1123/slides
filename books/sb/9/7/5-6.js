    "translation": "The son of Tribandhana was Satyavrata, who is celebrated by the name Triçaìku. Because he kidnapped the daughter of a brähmaëa when she was being married, his father cursed him to become a caëòäla, lower than a çüdra. Thereafter, by the influence of Viçvämitra, he went to the higher planetary system, the heavenly planets, in his material body, but because of the prowess of the demigods he fell back downward. Nonetheless, by the power of Viçvämitra, he did not fall all the way down; even today he can still be seen hanging in the sky, head downward.",
