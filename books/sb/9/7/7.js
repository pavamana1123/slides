            "content": "Viçvämitra and Vasiñöha were always inimical. Formerly, Viçvämitra was a kñatriya, and by undergoing severe austerities he wanted to become a brähmaëa, but Vasiñöha would not agree to accept him. In this way there was always disagreement between the two. Later, however, Vasiñöha accepted him because of Viçvämitra's quality of forgiveness. Once Hariçcandra performed a yajïa for which Viçvämitra was the priest, but Viçvämitra, being angry at Hariçcandra, took away all his possessions, claiming them as a contribution of dakñiëä. Vasiñöha, however, did not like this, and therefore a fight arose between Vasiñöha and Viçvämitra. The fighting became so severe that each of them cursed the other. One of them said, \"May you become a bird,\" and the other said, \"May you become a duck.\" Thus both of them became birds and continued fighting for many years because of Hariçcandra. We can see that such a great mystic yogé as Saubhari became a victim of sense gratification, and such great sages as Vasiñöha and Viçvämitra became birds. This is the material world. Äbrahma-bhuvanäl lokäù punar ävartino 'rjuna  at every step here there is danger. Therefore, because the Kåñëa consciousness movement provides the opportunity for the human being to get out of this material world simply by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra, this movement is the greatest benediction in human society."
