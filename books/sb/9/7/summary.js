            "content": "The most prominent son of Mändhätä was Ambaréña, his son was Yauvanäçva, and Yauvanäçva's son was Häréta. These three personalities were the best in the dynasty of Mändhätä. Purukutsa, another son of Mändhätä, married the sister of the snakes (sarpa-gaëa) named Narmadä. The son of Purukutsa was Trasaddasyu, whose son was Anaraëya. Anaraëya's son was Haryaçva, Haryaçva's son was Präruëa, Präruëa's son was Tribandhana, and Tribandhana's son was Satyavrata, also known as Triçaìku. When Triçaìku kidnapped the daughter of a brähmaëa, his father cursed him for this sinful act, and Triçaìku became a caëòäla, worse than a çüdra. Later, by the influence of Viçvämitra, he was brought to the heavenly planets, but by the influence of the demigods he fell back downward. He was stopped in his fall, however, by the influence of Viçvämitra. The son of Triçaìku was Hariçcandra. Hariçcandra once performed a Räjasüya-yajïa, but Viçvämitra cunningly took all of Hariçcandra's possessions as a dakñiëa contribution and chastised Hariçcandra in various ways. Because of this, a quarrel arose between Viçvämitra and Vasiñöha. Hariçcandra had no sons, but on the advice of Närada he worshiped Varuëa and in this way got a son named Rohita. Hariçcandra promised that Rohita would be used to perform a Varuëa-yajïa. Varuëa reminded Hariçcandra repeatedly about this yajïa, but the King, because of affection for his son, gave various arguments to avoid sacrificing him. Thus time passed, and gradually the son grew up. To safeguard his life, the boy then took bow and arrows in hand and went to the forest. Meanwhile, at home, Hariçcandra suffered from dropsy because of an attack from Varuëa. When Rohita received the news that his father was suffering, he wanted to return to the capital, but King Indra prevented him from doing so. Following the instructions of Indra, Rohita lived in the forest for six years and then returned home. Rohita purchased Çunaùçepha, the second son of Ajégarta, and gave him to his father, Hariçcandra, as the sacrificial animal. In this way, the sacrifice was performed, Varuëa and the other demigods were pacified, and Hariçcandra was freed from disease. In this sacrifice, Viçvämitra was the hotä priest, Jamadagni was the adhvaryu, Vasiñöha was the brahmä, and Ayäsya was the udgätä. King Indra, being very satisfied by the sacrifice, gave Hariçcandra a golden chariot, and Viçvämitra gave him transcendental knowledge. Thus Çukadeva Gosvämé describes how Hariçcandra achieved perfection."
