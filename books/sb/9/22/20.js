Ambä thought that Bhéñmadeva would marry her and became attached to him, but Bhéñmadeva refused to marry her, for he had taken the vow of brahmacarya. Ambä therefore approached Bhéñmadeva's military spiritual master, Paraçuräma, who instructed Bhéñma to marry her. Bhéñmadeva refused, and therefore Paraçuräma fought with him to force him to accept the marriage. But Paraçuräma was defeated, and he was pleased with Bhéñma."
