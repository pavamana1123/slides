    "translation": "When the brähmaëas said this, Mahäräja Çäntanu went to the forest and requested his elder brother Deväpi to take charge of the kingdom, for it is the duty of a king to maintain his subjects. Previously, however, Çäntanu's minister Açvavära had instigated some brähmaëas to induce Deväpi to transgress the injunctions of the Vedas and thus make himself unfit for the post of ruler. The brähmaëas deviated Deväpi from the path of the Vedic principles, and therefore when asked by Çäntanu he did not agree to accept the post of ruler. On the contrary, he blasphemed the Vedic principles and therefore became fallen. Under the circumstances, Çäntanu again became the king, and Indra, being pleased, showered rains. Deväpi later took to the path of mystic yoga to control his mind and senses and went to the village named Kaläpagräma, where he is still living.",
