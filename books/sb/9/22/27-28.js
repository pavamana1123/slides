    "translation": "Päëòu was restrained from sexual life because of having been cursed by a sage, and therefore his three sons Yudhiñöhira, Bhéma and Arjuna were begotten through the womb of his wife, Kunté, by Dharmaräja, by the demigod controlling the wind, and by the demigod controlling the rain. Päëòu's second wife, Mädré, gave birth to Nakula and Sahadeva, who were begotten by the two Açviné-kumäras. The five brothers, headed by Yudhiñöhira, begot five sons through the womb of Draupadé. These five sons were your uncles.",
