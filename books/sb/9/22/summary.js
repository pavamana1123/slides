Kuru had four sons-Parékñi, Sudhanu, Jahnu and Niñadha. Among the descendants in the dynasty from Sudhanu were Suhotra, Cyavana, Kåté and Uparicara Vasu.

In the dynasty from Båhadratha came Kuçägra, Åñabha, Satyahita, Puñpavän and Jahu, and from Båhadratha through the womb of another wife came Jaräsandha, who was followed by Sahadeva, Somäpi and Çrutaçravä.

Although Çäntanu, being younger, was not eligible to occupy the throne, he disregarded his elder brother. Consequently, there was no rainfall for twelve years. Following the advice of the brähmaëas, Çäntanu was ready to return the kingdom to Deväpi, but by the intrigue of Çäntanu's minister, Deväpi became unfit to be king. Therefore Çäntanu resumed charge of the kingdom, and rain fell properly during his regime. By mystic power, Deväpi still lives in the village known as Kaläpa-gräma. In this Kali-yuga, when the descendants of Soma known as the candra-vaàça (the lunar dynasty) die out, Deväpi, at the beginning of Satya-yuga, will reestablish the dynasty of the moon. The wife of Çäntanu named Gaìgä gave birth to Bhéñma, one of the twelve authorities. Two sons named Citräìgada and Vicitravérya were also born from the womb of Satyavaté by the semen of Çäntanu, and Vyäsadeva was born from Satyavaté by the semen of Paräçara, Vyäsadeva instructed the history of the Bhägavatam to his son Çukadeva. Through the womb of the two wives and the maidservant of Vicitravérya, Vyäsadeva begot Dhåtaräñöra, Päëòu and Vidura."
