            "content": "It is to be understood that Pärvaté is the daughter of the king of the very, very old mountainous country known as the Maëipura state. Five thousand years ago, therefore, when the Päëòavas ruled, Maëipura existed, as did its king. Therefore this kingdom is a very old, aristocratic Vaiñëava kingdom. If this kingdom is organized as a Vaiñëava state, this revitalization will be a great success because for five thousand years this state has maintained its identity. If the Vaiñëava spirit is revived there, it will be a wonderful place, renowned throughout the entire world. Maëipuri Vaiñëavas are very famous in Vaiñëava society. In Våndävana and Navadvépa there are many temples constructed by the king of Maëipura. Some of our devotees belong to the Maëipura state. The Kåñëa consciousness movement, therefore, can be well spread in the state of Maëipura by the cooperative efforts of the Kåñëa conscious devotees."
