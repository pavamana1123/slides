Therefore, after Vicitravérya's death, his mother, Satyavaté, who was also the mother of Vyäsadeva, asked Vyäsadeva to beget children through the wives of Vicitravérya. In those days, the brother of the husband could beget children through the womb of his sister-in-law. This was known as devareëa sutotpatti. If the husband was somehow unable to beget children, his brother could do so through the womb of his sister-in-law. This devareëa sutotpatti and the sacrifices of açvamedha and gomedha are forbidden in the age of Kali."
