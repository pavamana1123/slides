If marriages sometimes take place between different classes, these marriages are of two types, namely anuloma and pratiloma. Anuloma, marriage between a brähmaëa and the daughter of a kñatriya, is permissible, but pratiloma, marriage between a kñatriya and the daughter of a brähmaëa, is not generally allowed. Therefore Mahäräja Parékñit was curious about how Çukräcärya, a powerful brähmaëa, could accept the principle of pratiloma. Mahäräja Parékñit was eager to know the cause for this uncommon marriage."
