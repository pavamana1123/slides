    "translation": "The powerful Çukräcärya was angry for a few moments, but upon being satisfied he said to Våñaparvä: My dear King, kindly fulfill the desire of Devayäné, for she is my daughter and in this world I cannot give her up or neglect her.",

            "content": "Sometimes a great personality like Çukräcärya cannot neglect sons and daughters, for sons and daughters are by nature dependent on their father and the father has affection for them. Although Çukräcärya knew that the quarrel between Devayäné and Çarmiñöhä was childish, as Devayäné's father he had to side with his daughter. He did not like to do this, but he was obliged to because of affection. He plainly admitted that although he should not have asked the King for mercy for his daughter, because of affection he could not avoid doing so."
