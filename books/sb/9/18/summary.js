            "content": "When Nahuña, who had six sons, was cursed to become a python, his eldest son, Yati, took sannyäsa, and therefore the next son, Yayäti, was enthroned as king. By providence, Yayäti married the daughter of Çukräcärya. Çukräcärya was a brähmaëa and Yayäti a kñatriya, but Yayäti married her nonetheless. Çukräcärya's daughter, named Devayäné, had a girl friend named Çarmiñöhä, who was the daughter of Våñaparvä. King Yayäti married Çarmiñöhä also. The history of this marriage is as follows. Once Çarmiñöhä was sporting in the water with thousands of her girl friends, and Devayäné was also there. When the young girls saw Lord Çiva, seated on his bull with Umä, they immediately dressed themselves, but Çarmiñöhä mistakenly put on Devayäné's clothes. Devayäné, being very angry, rebuked Çarmiñöhä, who also became very angry and responded by rebuking Devayäné and throwing her into a well. By chance, King Yayäti came to that well to drink water, and he found Devayäné and rescued her. Thus Devayäné accepted Mahäräja Yayäti as her husband. Thereafter, Devayäné, crying loudly, told her father about Çarmiñöhä's behavior. Upon hearing of this incident, Çukräcärya was very angry and wanted to chastise Våñaparvä, Çarmiñöhä's father. Våñaparvä, however, satisfied Çukräcärya by offering Çarmiñöhä as Devayäné's maidservant. Thus Çarmiñöhä, as the maidservant of Devayäné, also went to the house of Devayäné's husband. When Çarmiñöhä found her friend Devayäné with a son she also desired to have a son. Therefore, at the proper time for conception, she also requested Mahäräja Yayäti for sex. When Çarmiñöhä became pregnant also, Devayäné was very envious. In great anger, she immediately left for her father's house and told her father everything. Çukräcärya again became angry and cursed Mahäräja Yayäti to become old, but when Yayäti begged Çukräcärya to be merciful to him, Çukräcärya gave him the benediction that he could transfer his old age and invalidity to some young man. Yayäti exchanged his old age for the youth of his youngest son, Püru, and thus he was able to enjoy with young girls."
