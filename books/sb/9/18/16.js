Therefore, because a brähmaëa depends on his disciples, when Çarmiñöhä was heavily rebuked by Devayäné she charged Devayäné with belonging to a family of crowlike beggars. It is the nature of women to fight verbally at even a slight provocation. As we see from this incident, this has been their nature for a long, long time."
