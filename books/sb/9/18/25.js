            "content": "When a brähmaëa adopts the profession of a kapota, or pigeon, he lives by collecting grains from the field. This is called uïcha-våtti. A brähmaëa who takes to this uïcha-våtti profession is called first class because he depends completely on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and does not beg from anyone. Although the profession of begging is allowed for a brähmaëa or sannyäsé, one does better if he can avoid such a profession and completely depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead for maintenance. Çukräcärya was certainly very sorry that because of his daughter's complaint he had to go to his disciple to beg some mercy, which he was obliged to do because he had accepted the profession of priesthood. In his heart, Çukräcärya did not like his profession, but since he had accepted it, he was obliged to go unwillingly to his disciple to settle the grievance submitted by his daughter."
