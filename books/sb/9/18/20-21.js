    "translation": "With words saturated with love and affection, Devayäné said to King Yayäti: O great hero, O King, conqueror of the cities of your enemies, by accepting my hand you have accepted me as your married wife. Let me not be touched by others, for our relationship as husband and wife has been made possible by providence, not by any human being.",

            "content": "While taking Devayäné out of the well, King Yayäti must certainly have appreciated her youthful beauty, and therefore he might have asked her which caste she belonged to. Thus Devayäné would have immediately replied, \"We are already married because you have accepted my hand.\" Uniting the hands of the bride and bridegroom is a system perpetually existing in all societies. Therefore, as soon as Yayäti accepted Devayäné's hand, they could be regarded as married. Because Devayäné was enamored with the hero Yayäti, she requested him not to change his mind and let another come to marry her."
