    "translation": "Because of falling in the well, I met you. Indeed, this has been arranged by providence. After I cursed Kaca, the son of the learned scholar Båhaspati, he cursed me by saying that I would not have a brähmaëa for a husband. Therefore, O mighty-armed one, there is no possibility of my becoming the wife of a brähmaëa.",

            "content": "Kaca, the son of the learned celestial priest Båhaspati, had been a student of Çukräcärya, from whom he had learned the art of reviving a man who has died untimely. This art, called måta-saïjévané, was especially used during wartime. When there was a war, soldiers would certainly die untimely, but if a soldier's body was intact, he could be brought to life again by this art of måta-saïjévané. This art was known to Çukräcärya and many others, and Kaca, the son of Båhaspati, became Çukräcärya's student to learn it. Devayäné desired to have Kaca as her husband, but Kaca, out of regard for Çukräcärya, looked upon the guru's daughter as a respectable superior and therefore refused to marry her. Devayäné angrily cursed Kaca by saying that although he had learned the art of måta-saïjévané from her father, it would be useless. When cursed in this way, Kaca retaliated by cursing Devayäné never to have a husband who was a brähmaëa. Because Devayäné liked Yayäti, who was a kñatriya, she requested him to accept her as his bona fide wife. Although this would be pratiloma-viväha, a marriage between the daughter of a high family and the son of a lower family, she explained that this arrangement was made by providence."
