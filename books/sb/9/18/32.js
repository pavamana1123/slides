    "translation": "When Princess Çarmiñöhä begged King Yayäti for a son, the King was certainly aware of the principles of religion, and therefore he agreed to fulfill her desire. Although he remembered the warning of Çukräcärya, he thought of this union as the desire of the Supreme, and thus he had sex with Çarmiñöhä.",

            "content": "King Yayäti was completely aware of the duty of a kñatriya. When a kñatriya is approached by a woman, he cannot deny her. This is a religious principle. Consequently, when Dharmaräja, Yudhiñöhira, saw Arjuna unhappy after Arjuna returned from Dvärakä, he asked whether Arjuna had refused a woman who had begged for a son. Although Mahäräja Yayäti remembered Çukräcärya's warning, he could not refuse Çarmiñöhä. He thought it wise to give her a son, and thus he had sexual intercourse with her after her menstrual period. This kind of lust is not against religious principles. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , dharmäviruddho bhüteñu kämo 'smi: sex life not contrary to the principles of religion is sanctioned by Kåñëa. Because Çarmiñöhä, the daughter of a king, had begged Yayäti for a son, their combination was not lust but an act of religion."
