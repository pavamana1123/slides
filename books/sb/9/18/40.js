It aims at giving one the facility to return home, back to Godhead, which one cannot do without completely renouncing all connections with the material world. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu said, niñkiïcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya: one who wants to go back home, back to Godhead, must be niñkiïcana, free from all affinity for material enjoyment. Brahmaëy upaçamäçrayam: unless one is fully renounced, one cannot engage in devotional service or stay in Brahman. Devotional service is rendered on the Brahman platform. Therefore, unless one attains the Brahman platform, or spiritual platform, one cannot engage in devotional service; or, in other words, a person engaged in devotional service is already on the Brahman platform."

Generally, unless one enjoys material happiness, one cannot attain renunciation. Varëäçrama therefore gives the opportunity for gradual elevation. Yadu, the son of Mahäräja Yayäti, explained that he was unable to give up his youth, for he wanted to use it to attain the renounced order in the future."

            "content": "Mahäräja Yadu was different from his brothers. As stated in the next verse, turvasuç coditaù piträ druhyuç cänuç ca bhärata/ pratyäcakhyur adharmajïäù. Mahäräja Yadu's brothers refused to accept their father's proposal because they were not completely aware of dharma. To accept orders that follow religious principles, especially the orders of one's father, is very important. Therefore when the brothers of Mahäräja Yadu refused their father's order, this was certainly irreligious. Mahäräja Yadu's refusal, however, was religious. As stated in the Tenth Canto, yadoç ca dharma-çéläya: Mahäräja Yadu was completely aware of the principles of religion. The ultimate principle of religion is to engage oneself in devotional service to the Lord. Mahäräja Yadu was very eager to engage himself in the Lord's service, but there was an impediment: during youth the material desire to enjoy the material senses is certainly present, and unless one fully satisfies these lusty desires in youth, there is a chance of one's being disturbed in rendering service to the Lord. We have actually seen that many sannyäsés who accept sannyäsa prematurely, not having satisfied their material desires, fall down because they are disturbed. Therefore the general process is to go through gåhastha life and vänaprastha life and finally come to sannyäsa and devote oneself completely to the service of the Lord. Mahäräja Yadu was ready to accept his father's order and exchange youth for old age because he was confident that the youth taken by his father would be returned. But because this exchange would delay his complete engagement in devotional service, he did not want to accept his father's old age, for he was eager to achieve freedom from disturbances. Moreover, among the descendants of Yadu would be Lord Kåñëa. Therefore, because Yadu was eager to see the Lord's appearance in his dynasty as soon as possible, Yadu refused to accept his father's proposal. This was not irreligious, however, because Yadu's purpose was to serve the Lord. Because Yadu was a faithful servant of the Lord, Lord Kåñëa appeared in his dynasty. As confirmed in the prayers of Kunté, yadoù priyasyänvaväye. Yadu was very dear to Kåñëa, who was therefore eager to descend in Yadu's dynasty. In conclusion, Mahäräja Yadu should not be considered adharma jïa, ignorant of religious principles, as the next verse designates his brothers. He was like the four Sanakas (catuù-sana), who refused the order of their father, Brahmä, for the sake of a better cause. Because the four Kumäras wanted to engage themselves completely in the service of the Lord as brahmacärés, their refusal to obey their father's order was not irreligious."
