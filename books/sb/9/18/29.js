    "translation": "Våñaparvä wisely thought that Çukräcärya's displeasure would bring danger and that his pleasure would bring material gain. Therefore he carried out Çukräcärya's order and served him like a slave. He gave his daughter Çarmiñöhä to Devayäné, and Çarmiñöhä served Devayäné like a slave, along with thousands of other women.",

            "content": "In the beginning of these affairs concerning Çarmiñöhä and Devayäné, we saw that Çarmiñöhä had many friends. Now these friends became maidservants of Devayäné. When a girl married a kñatriya king, it was customary for all her girl friends to go with her to her husband's house. For instance, when Vasudeva married Devaké, the mother of Kåñëa, he married all six of her sisters, and she also had many friends who accompanied her. A king would maintain not only his wife but also the many friends and maidservants of his wife. Some of these maidservants would become pregnant and give birth to children. Such children were accepted as däsé-putra, the sons of the maidservants, and the king would maintain them. The female population is always greater than the male, but since a woman needs to be protected by a man, the king would maintain many girls, who acted either as friends or as maidservants of the queen. In the history of Kåñëa's household life we find that Kåñëa married 16,108 wives. These were not maidservants but direct queens, and Kåñëa expanded Himself into 16,108 forms to maintain different establishments for each and every wife. This is not possible for ordinary men. Therefore although the kings had to maintain many, many servants and wives, not all of them had different establishments."
