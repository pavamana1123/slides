    "translation": "We are among the qualified brähmaëas, who are accepted as the face of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The brähmaëas have created the entire universe by their austerity, and they always keep the Absolute Truth within the core of their hearts. They have directed the path of good fortune, the path of Vedic civilization, and because they are the only worshipable objects within this world, they are offered prayers and worshiped even by the great demigods, the directors of the various planets, and even by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul, the supreme purifier, the husband of the goddess of fortune. And we are even more respectable because we are in the dynasty of Bhågu. Yet although this woman's father, being among the demons, is our disciple, she has put on my dress, exactly like a çüdra taking charge of Vedic knowledge.",
