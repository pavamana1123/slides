    "translation": "Urvaçé said: My dear King, you are a man, a hero. Don't be impatient and give up your life. Be sober and don't allow the senses to overcome you like foxes. Don't let the foxes eat you. In other words, you should not be controlled by your senses. Rather, you should know that the heart of a woman is like that of a fox. There is no use making friendship with women.",

Women have been compared to çüdras and vaiçyas (striyo vaiçyäs tathä çüdräù ). On the spiritual platform, however, when one is elevated to the platform of Kåñëa consciousness, whether one is a man, woman, çüdra or whatever, everyone is equal. Otherwise, Urvaçé, who was a woman herself and who knew the nature of women, said that a woman's heart is like that of a sly fox. If a man cannot control his senses, he becomes a victim of such sly foxes. But if one can control the senses, there is no chance of his being victimized by sly, foxlike women. Cäëakya Paëòita has also advised that if one has a wife like a sly fox, he must immediately give up his life at home and go to the forest."
