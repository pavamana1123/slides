Çukra, being an enemy of Båhaspati, also joined the moon-god to retaliate in wrath against Båhaspati. To counteract this situation, Lord Çiva, who was affectionate toward Båhaspati, joined Båhaspati. The father of Båhaspati was Aìgirä, from whom Lord Çiva had received knowledge. Therefore Lord Çiva had some affection for Båhaspati and joined his side in this fight. Çrédhara Svämé remarks, aìgirasaù sakäçät präpta-vidyo hara iti prasiddhaù: \"Lord Çiva is well known to have received knowledge from Aìgirä.\""
