    "translation": "By means of that fire, Purüravä, who desired to go to the planet where Urvaçé resided, performed a sacrifice, by which he satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, the enjoyer of the results of sacrifice. Thus he worshiped the Lord, who is beyond the perception of the senses and is the reservoir of all the demigods.",

Therefore although Purüravä desired something material, he factually performed yajïa to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is adhokñaja, beyond the perception of Purüravä and everyone else. Consequently, some kind of yajïa must be performed to fulfill the desires of the living entity. Yajïas can be performed in human society only when society is divided by varëäçrama-dharma into four varëas and four äçramas. Without such a regulative process, no one can perform yajïas, and without the performance of yajïas, no material plans can make human society happy at any time. Everyone should therefore be induced to perform yajïas. In this age of Kali, the yajïa recommended is saìkértana, the individual or collective chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. This will bring the fulfillment of all necessities for human society."
