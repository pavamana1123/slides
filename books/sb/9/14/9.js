But instead she preferred to be impregnated by Soma, the moon-god, and therefore she was unchaste. Although Båhaspati accepted Tärä from Brahmä, when he saw that she was pregnant he wanted her to deliver a son immediately. Tärä certainly very much feared her husband, and she thought she might be punished after giving birth. Thus Båhaspati assured her that he would not punish her, for although she was unchaste and had become pregnant illicitly, she wanted a son."
