    "translation": "King Purüravä then left Agnisthälé in the forest and returned home, where he meditated all night upon Urvaçé. In the course of his meditation, the Tretä millennium began, and therefore the principles of the three Vedas, including the process of performing yajïa to fulfill fruitive activities, appeared within his heart.",

            "content": "It is said, tretäyäà yajato makhaiù: in Tretä-yuga, if one performed yajïas, he would get the results of those yajïas. By performing viñëu-yajïa specifically, one could even achieve the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Of course, yajïa is intended to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. While Purüravä was meditating upon Urvaçé, the Tretä-yuga began, and therefore the Vedic yajïas were revealed in his heart. But Purüravä was a materialistic man, especially interested in enjoying the senses. Yajïas for enjoyment of the senses are called karma-käëòéya-yajïas. Therefore, he decided to perform karma-käëòéya-yajïas to fulfill his lusty desires. In other words, karma-käëòéya-yajïas are meant for sensuous persons, whereas yajïa should actually be performed to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To please the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Kali-yuga, the saìkértana-yajïa is recommended. Yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù . Only those who are very intelligent take to saìkértana-yajïa to fulfill all their desires, material and spiritual, whereas those who are lusty for sense enjoyment perform karma-käëòéya-yajïas."
