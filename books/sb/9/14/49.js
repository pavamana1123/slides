Indeed, everyone always meditated upon Lord Viñëu, Näräyaëa, and achieved every success by this process of meditation. In the next yuga, Tretä-yuga, the performance of yajïa began (tretäyäà yajato mukhaiù). Therefore this verse says, trayé tretä-mukhe. Ritualistic ceremonies are generally called fruitive activities. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says that in Tretä-yuga, beginning in the Sväyambhuva-manvantara, ritualistic fruitive activities were similarly manifested from Priyavrata, etc."
