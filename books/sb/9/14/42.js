    "translation": "Urvaçé said: \"My dear King, seek shelter of the Gandharvas, for they will be able to deliver me to you again.\" In accordance with these words, the King satisfied the Gandharvas by prayers, and the Gandharvas, being pleased with him, gave him an Agnisthälé girl who looked exactly like Urvaçé. Thinking that the girl was Urvaçé, the King began walking with her in the forest, but later he could understand that she was not Urvaçé but Agnisthälé.",

Immediately after getting the Agnisthälé girl, he wanted to have sex with her, but during sexual intercourse he could understand that the girl was Agnisthälé, not Urvaçé. This indicates that every man attached to a particular woman knows the particular characteristics of that woman during sex life. Thus Purüravä understood during sexual intercourse that the Agnisthälé girl was not Urvaçé."
