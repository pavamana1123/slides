But here we find that Soma was born from the tears in the eyes of Atri. This appears contradictory to the Vedic information, but actually it is not, for this birth of the moon is understood to have taken place in another millennium. When tears appear in the eyes because of jubilation, the tears are soothing. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says, dågbhya änandäçrubhya ata evämåtamayaù: \"Here the word dågbhyaù means 'from tears of jubilation.' Therefore the moon-god is called amåtamayaù, 'full of soothing rays.' \" In the Fourth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam  we find this verse:"
