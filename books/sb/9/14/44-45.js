    "translation": "When the process of fruitive yajïa became manifest within his heart, King Purüravä went to the same spot where he had left Agnisthälé. There he saw that from the womb of a çamé tree, an açvattha tree had grown. He then took a piece of wood from that tree and made it into two araëis. Desiring to go to the planet where Urvaçé resided, he chanted mantras, meditating upon the lower araëi as Urvaçé, the upper one as himself, and the piece of wood between them as his son. In this way he began to ignite a fire.",

            "content": "The Vedic fire for performing yajïa was not ignited with ordinary matches or similar devices. Rather, the Vedic sacrificial fire was ignited by the araëis, or two sacred pieces of wood, which produced fire by friction with a third. Such a fire is necessary for the performance of yajïa. If successful, a yajïa will fulfill the desire of its performer. Thus Purüravä took advantage of the process of yajïa to fulfill his lusty desires. He thought of the lower araëi as Urvaçé, the upper one as himself, and the middle one as his son. A relevant Vedic mantra quoted herein by Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura is çamé-garbhäd agnià mantha. A similar mantra is urvaçyäm urasi purüraväù. Purüravä wanted to have children continuously by the womb of Urvaçé. His only ambition was to have sex life with Urvaçé and thereby get a son. In other words, he had so much lust in his heart that even while performing yajïa he thought of Urvaçé, instead of thinking of the master of yajïa, Yajïeçvara, Lord Viñëu."
