    "synonyms": "tasya—of Purüravä; nirmanthanät—because of interaction; jätaù—was born; jäta-vedäù—meant for material enjoyment according to the Vedic principles; vibhävasuù—a fire; trayyä—following the Vedic principles; saù—the fire; vidyayä—by such a process; räjïä—by the King; putratve—a son's being born; kalpitaù—it so became; tri-våt—the three letters a-u-m combined together as oà.",
    "translation": "From Purüravä's rubbing of the araëis came a fire. By such a fire one can achieve all success in material enjoyment and be purified in seminal birth, initiation and in the performance of sacrifice, which are invoked with the combined letters a-u-m. Thus the fire was considered the son of King Purüravä.",

            "content": "According to the Vedic process, one can get a son through semen (çukra), one can get a bona fide disciple through initiation (sävitra), or one can get a son or disciple through the fire of sacrifice (yajïa). Thus when Mahäräja Purüravä generated the fire by rubbing the araëis, the fire became his son. Either by semen, by initiation or by yajïa one may get a son. The Vedic mantra oàkära, or praëava, consisting of the letters a-u-m, can call each of these three methods into existence. Therefore the words nirmanthanäj jätaù indicate that by the rubbing of the araëis a son was born."
