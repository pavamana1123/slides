    "translation": "My dear King Purüravä, please give protection to these two lambs, who have fallen down with me. Although I belong to the heavenly planets and you belong to earth, I shall certainly enjoy sexual union with you. I have no objection to accepting you as my husband, for you are superior in every respect.",

There are various planets and various atmospheres within this universe. The atmosphere of the heavenly planet from which Urvaçé descended after being cursed by Mitra and Varuëa was different from the atmosphere of this earth. Indeed, the inhabitants of the heavenly planets are certainly far superior to the inhabitants of earth. Nonetheless, Urvaçé agreed to remain the consort of Purüravä, although she belonged to a superior community. A woman who finds a man with superior qualities may accept such a man as her husband. Similarly, if a man finds a woman who is from an inferior family but who has good qualities, he can accept such a brilliant wife, as advised by Çré Cäëakya Paëòita (stré-ratnaà duñkuläd api). The combination of male and female is worthwhile if the qualities of both are on an equal level."
