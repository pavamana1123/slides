    "translation": "In the Satya-yuga, the first millennium, all the Vedic mantras were included in one mantra-praëava, the root of all Vedic mantras. In other words, the Atharva Veda alone was the source of all Vedic knowledge. The Supreme Personality of Godhead Näräyaëa was the only worshipable Deity; there was no recommendation for worship of the demigods. Fire was one only, and the only order of life in human society was known as haàsa.",

            "content": "In Satya-yuga there was only one Veda, not four. Later, before the beginning of Kali-yuga, this one Veda, the Atharva Veda (or, some say, the Yajur Veda), was divided into four—Säma, Yajur, Åg and Atharva—for the facility of human society. In Satya-yuga the only mantra was oàkära (oà tat sat). The same name oàkära is manifest in the mantra Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Unless one is a brähmaëa, one cannot utter oàkära and get the desired result. But in Kali-yuga almost everyone is a çüdra, unfit for pronouncing the praëava, oàkära. Therefore the çästras have recommended the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. Oàkära is a mantra, or mahä-mantra, and Hare Kåñëa is also a mahä-mantra. The purpose of pronouncing oàkära is to address the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva (oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya). And the purpose of chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra is the same. Hare: \"O energy of the Lord!\" Kåñëa: \"O Lord Kåñëa!\" Hare: \"O energy of the Lord!\" Räma: \"O Supreme Lord, O supreme enjoyer!\" The only worshipable Lord is Hari, who is the goal of the Vedas (vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù . Simply by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra, one becomes free from the bondage of material existence and thus becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead."
