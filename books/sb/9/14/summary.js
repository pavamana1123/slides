            "content": "Lord Brahmä was born from the lotus that sprouted from the navel of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu. Brahmä had a son named Atri, and Atri's son was Soma, the king of all drugs and stars. Soma became the conqueror of the entire universe, and, being inflated with pride, he kidnapped Tärä, who was the wife of Båhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods. A great fight ensued between the demigods and the asuras, but Brahmä rescued Båhaspati's wife from the clutches of Soma and returned her to her husband, thus stopping the fighting. In the womb of Tärä, Soma begot a son named Budha, who later begot in the womb of Ilä a son named Aila, or Purüravä. Urvaçé was captivated by Purüravä's beauty, and therefore she lived with him for some time, but when she left his company he became almost like a madman. While traveling all over the world, he met Urvaçé again at Kurukñetra, but she agreed to join with him for only one night in a year."

            "content": "One year later, Purüravä saw Urvaçé at Kurukñetra and was glad to be with her for one night, but when he thought of her leaving him again, he was overwhelmed by grief. Urvaçé then advised Purüravä to worship the Gandharvas. Being satisfied with Purüravä, the Gandharvas gave him a woman known as Agnisthälé. Purüravä mistook Agnisthälé for Urvaçé, but while he was wandering in the forest his misunderstanding was cleared, and he immediately gave up her company. After returning home and meditating upon Urvaçé all night, he wanted to perform a Vedic ritualistic ceremony to satisfy his desire. Thereafter he went to the same place where he had left Agnisthälé, and there he saw that from the womb of a çamé tree had come an açvattha tree. Purüravä made two sticks from this tree and thus produced a fire. By such a fire one can satisfy all lusty desires. The fire was considered the son of Purüravä. In Satya-yuga there was only one social division, called haàsa; there were no divisions of varëa like brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra. The Veda was the oàkära. The various demigods were not worshiped, for only the Supreme Personality of Godhead was the worshipable Deity."
