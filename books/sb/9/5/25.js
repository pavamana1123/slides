Because of his devotion, he thought even the topmost planet of this material world no better than the hellish planets.",

The Absolute Truth is realized in three features—Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän (brahmeti paramätmeti bhagavän iti çabdyate ). And as far as jïäna is concerned, if one is a perfect devotee of Väsudeva, he is the greatest mahätmä (väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù). A mahätmä is one who has full knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Thus Mahäräja Ambaréña, being a devotee of the Personality of Godhead, was in full awareness of Paramätmä, Brahman, mäyä, the material world, the spiritual world, and how things are going on everywhere. Everything was known to him. Yasmin vijïäte sarvam evaà vijïätaà bhavati (Muëòaka Upaniñad 1.3). Because the devotee knows Väsudeva, he knows everything within the creation of Väsudeva (väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù). Such a devotee does not give much value to the highest standard of happiness within this material world."

As far as the heavenly planets are concerned, to a devotee they are like a phantasmagoria or will-o'-the-wisp, and as far as yogic perfection is concerned, a devotee does not care a fig for such perfection, since the purpose of yogic perfection is achieved automatically by the devotee. This is all possible when one becomes a devotee of the Lord through the medium of Caitanya Mahäprabhu's instructions."
