    "translation": "After one year, when Durväsä Muni had returned, King Ambaréña sumptuously fed him all varieties of pure food, and then he himself also ate. When the King saw that the brähmaëa Durväsä had been released from the great danger of being burned, he could understand that by the grace of the Lord he himself was also powerful, but he did not take any credit, for everything had been done by the Lord.",

Of course, this material world is full of dangers that one has to meet, but a devotee, because of his full dependence on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is never disturbed. The vivid example is Mahäräja Ambaréña. He was the emperor of the entire world and had many duties to perform, and in the course of these duties there were many disturbances created by persons like Durväsä Muni, but the King tolerated everything, patiently depending fully on the mercy of the Lord. The Lord, however, is situated in everyone's heart (sarvasya cähaà hådi sanniviñöaù :"
