            "content": "By the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, Durväsä Muni immediately went to Mahäräja Ambaréña and fell at his lotus feet. Mahäräja Ambaréña, being naturally very humble and meek, felt shy and ashamed because Durväsä Muni had fallen at his feet, and thus he began to offer prayers to the Sudarçana cakra just to save Durväsä. What is this Sudarçana cakra? The Sudarçana cakra is the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by which He creates the entire material world. Sa aikñata, sa asåjata. This is the Vedic version. The Sudarçana cakra, which is the origin of creation and is most dear to the Lord, has thousands of spokes. This Sudarçana cakra is the killer of the prowess of all other weapons, the killer of darkness, and the manifester of the prowess of devotional service; it is the means of establishing religious principles, and it is the killer of all irreligious activities. Without his mercy, the universe cannot be maintained, and therefore the Sudarçana cakra is employed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Mahäräja Ambaréña thus prayed that the Sudarçana cakra be merciful, the Sudarçana cakra, being appeased, refrained from killing Durväsä Muni, who thus achieved the Sudarçana cakra's mercy. Durväsä Muni thus learned to give up the nasty idea of considering a Vaiñëava an ordinary person (vaiñëave jäti-buddhi). Mahäräja Ambaréña belonged to the kñatriya group, and therefore Durväsä Muni considered him lower than the brähmaëas and wanted to exercise brahminical power against him. By this incident, everyone should learn how to stop mischievous ideas of neglecting Vaiñëavas. After this incident, Mahäräja Ambaréña gave Durväsä Muni sumptuous food to eat, and then the King, who had been standing in the same place for one year without eating anything, also took prasäda. Mahäräja Ambaréña later divided his property among his sons and went to the bank of the Mänasa-sarovara to execute devotional meditation."
