    "translation": "O Sudarçana, you have a very auspicious hub, and therefore you are the upholder of all religion. You are just like an inauspicious comet for the irreligious demons. Indeed, you are the maintainer of the three worlds, you are full of transcendental effulgence, you are as quick as the mind, and you are able to work wonders. I can simply utter the word namaù, offering all obeisances unto you.",

            "content": "The disc of the Lord is called Sudarçana because he does not discriminate between high and low criminals or demons. Durväsä Muni was certainly a powerful brähmaëa, but his acts against the pure devotee Mahäräja Ambaréña were no better than the activities of asuras. As stated in the çästras, dharmaà tu säkñäd bhagavat-praëétam:  real dharma is surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore real dharma means bhakti, or devotional service to the Lord. The Sudarçana cakra is here addressed as dharma-setave, the protector of dharma. Mahäräja Ambaréña was a truly religious person, and consequently for his protection the Sudarçana cakra was ready to punish even such a strict brähmaëa as Durväsä Muni because he had acted like a demon. There are demons even in the form of brähmaëas. Therefore the Sudarçana cakra does not discriminate between brähmaëa demons and çüdra demons. Anyone against the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees is called a demon. In the çästras we find many brähmaëas and kñatriyas who acted as demons and have been described as demons. According to the verdict of the çästras, one has to be understood according to his symptoms. If one is born of a brähmaëa father but his symptoms are demoniac, he is regarded as a demon. The Sudarçana cakra is always concerned with annihilating the demons. Therefore he is described as adharma-çéläsura-dhüma-ketave. Those who are not devotees are called adharma-çéla. The Sudarçana cakra is just like an inauspicious comet for all such demons."
