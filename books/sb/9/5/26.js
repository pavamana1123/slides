Mahäräja Ambaréña was undoubtedly liberated in any condition, but as an ideal king he accepted the vänaprastha order of retirement from family life. It is essential for one to renounce family responsibilities and fully concentrate on the lotus feet of Väsudeva. Therefore Mahäräja Ambaréña divided the kingdom among his sons and retired from family life."
