    "translation": "Durväsä Muni said: I am very pleased with you, my dear King. At first I thought of you as an ordinary human being and accepted your hospitality, but later I could understand, by my own intelligence, that you are the most exalted devotee of the Lord. Therefore, simply by seeing you, touching your feet and talking with you, I have been pleased and have become obliged to you.",

            "content": "It is said, vaiñëavera kriyä mudrä vijïeha nä bujhaya:  even a very intelligent man cannot understand the activities of a pure Vaiñëava. Therefore, because Durväsä Muni was a great mystic yogé, he first mistook Mahäräja Ambaréña for an ordinary human being and wanted to punish him. Such is the mistaken observation of a Vaiñëava. When Durväsä Muni was persecuted by the Sudarçana cakra, however, his intelligence developed. Therefore the word ätma-medhasä is used to indicate that by his personal experience he would understand how great a Vaiñëava the King was. When Durväsä Muni was chased by the Sudarçana cakra, he wanted to take shelter of Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, and he was even able to go to the spiritual world, meet the Personality of Godhead and talk with Him face to face, yet he was unable to be rescued from the attack of the Sudarçana cakra. Thus he could understand the influence of a Vaiñëava by personal experience. Durväsä Muni was certainly a great yogé and a very learned brähmaëa, but despite his being a real yogé he was unable to understand the influence of a Vaiñëava. Therefore it is said, vaiñëavera kriyä mudrä vijïeha nä bujhaya: even the most learned person cannot understand the value of a Vaiñëava. There is always a possibility for so-called jïänés and yogés to be mistaken when studying the character of a Vaiñëava. A Vaiñëava can be understood by how much he is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in terms of his inconceivable activities."
