This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti ). If one is free from the bondage of both the gross and subtle material bodies and remains a pure soul, he returns home, back to Godhead, to be engaged in the service of the Lord. Tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti mäm eti: he goes back home, back to Godhead. Thus it appears that Saubhari Muni attained that perfect stage."
