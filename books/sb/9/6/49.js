The history is that when Garuòa wanted to eat fish, Saubhari Muni unnecessarily gave the fish shelter under his care. Because Garuòa's plans for eating were disappointed, Saubhari Muni certainly committed a great offense to a Vaiñëava. Because of this vaiñëava-aparädha, an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava, Saubhari Muni fell from his exalted position of mystic tapasya. One should not, therefore, impede the activities of a Vaiñëava. This is the lesson we must learn from this incident concerning Saubhari Muni."
