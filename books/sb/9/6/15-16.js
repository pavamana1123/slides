    "translation": "Well protected by armor and desiring to fight, Puraïjaya took up a transcendental bow and very sharp arrows, and, while being highly praised by the demigods, he got up on the back of the bull [Indra] and sat on its hump. Thus he is known as Kakutstha. Being empowered by Lord Viñëu, who is the Supersoul and the Supreme Person, Puraïjaya sat on the great bull and is therefore known as Indraväha. Surrounded by the demigods, he attacked the residence of the demons in the west.",
