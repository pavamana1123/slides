Offering oblations to the forefathers in the ceremony known as çräddha is also a kind of yajïa. In this yajïa, flesh obtained from the forest by hunting could be offered. However, in the present age, Kali-yuga, this kind of offering is forbidden. Quoting from the Brahma-vaivarta Puräëa, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu said:"

Formerly, such an offering was allowed, but in this age it is forbidden. In this age, Kali-yuga, everyone is expert in hunting animals, but most of the people are çüdras, not kñatriyas. According to Vedic injunctions, however, only kñatriyas are allowed to hunt, whereas çüdras are allowed to eat flesh after offering goats or other insignificant animals before the deity of goddess Kälé or similar demigods. On the whole, meat-eating is not completely forbidden; a particular class of men is allowed to eat meat according to various circumstances and injunctions. As far as eating beef is concerned, however, it is strictly prohibited to everyone. Thus in Bhagavad-gétä Kåñëa personally speaks of go-rakñyam, cow protection. Meat-eaters, according to their different positions and the directions of the çästra, are allowed to eat flesh, but never the flesh of cows. Cows must be given all protection."
