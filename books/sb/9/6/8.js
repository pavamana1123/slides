    "translation": "Vikukñi offered the remnants of the flesh to King Ikñväku, who gave it to Vasiñöha for purification. But Vasiñöha could immediately understand that part of the flesh had already been taken by Vikukñi, and therefore he said that it was unfit to be used in the çräddha ceremony.",

One cannot eat food from the kitchen unless it is offered to the Deity. If something is taken before being offered to the Deity, the entire preparation is polluted and can no longer be offered. Those engaged in Deity worship must know this very well so that they may be saved from committing offenses in Deity worship."
