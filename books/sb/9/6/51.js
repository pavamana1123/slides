One should always stay in a secluded place, completely fixing his mind at the lotus feet of the unlimited Personality of Godhead, and if one wants any association at all, he should associate with persons similarly engaged.",

He must not associate with viñayé—materialistic persons or those interested in sex life. Every materialist is interested in sex. Thus in plain language it is advised that an exalted saintly person avoid the association of those who are materially inclined. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura also recommends that one engage in the service of the äcäryas, and if one wants to live in association, he must live in the association of devotees (täìdera caraëa sevi bhakta-sane väsa). The Kåñëa consciousness movement is creating many centers just to create devotees so that by associating with the members of such a center people will automatically become uninterested in material affairs. Although this is an ambitious proposal, this association is proving effective by the mercy of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. By gradually associating with the members of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, simply by taking prasäda and taking part in chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra, ordinary persons are being considerably elevated. Saubhari Muni regrets that he had bad association even in the deepest part of the water. Because of the bad association of the sexually engaged fish, he fell down. A secluded place is also not secure unless there is good association."
