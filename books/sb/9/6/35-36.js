    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not different from the auspicious aspects of great sacrifices, such as the ingredients of the sacrifice, the chanting of Vedic hymns, the regulative principles, the performer, the priests, the result of the sacrifice, the arena of sacrifice, and the time of sacrifice. Knowing the principles of self-realization, Mändhätä worshiped that transcendentally situated Supreme Soul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viñëu, who comprises all the demigods. He also gave immense charity to the brähmaëas, and thus he performed yajïa to worship the Lord.",
