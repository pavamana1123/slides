The sons of Mahäräja Ikñväku became kings of different parts of the world. Because of violating sacrificial rules and regulations, one of these sons, Vikukñi, was banished from the kingdom. By the mercy of Vasiñöha and the power of mystic yoga, Mahäräja Ikñväku attained liberation after giving up his material body. When Mahäräja Ikñväku expired, his son Vikukñi returned and took charge of the kingdom. He performed various types of sacrifices, and thus he pleased the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This Vikukñi later became celebrated as Saçäda."

The son of Puraïjaya was Anenä, the son of Anenä was Påthu, and the son of Påthu was Viçvagandhi. The son of Viçvagandhi was Candra, the son of Candra was Yuvanäçva, and his son was Çrävasta, who constructed Çrävasté Puré. The son of Çrävasta was Båhadaçva. Båhadaçva's son Kuvalayäçva killed a demon named Dhundhu, and thus he became celebrated as Dhundhumära, \"the killer of Dhundhu.\" The sons of the killer of Dhundhu were Dåòhäçva, Kapiläçva and Bhadräçva. He also had thousands of other sons, but they burned to ashes in the fire emanating from Dhundhu. The son of Dåòhäçva was Haryaçva, the son of Haryaçva was Nikumbha, the son of Nikumbha was Bahuläçva, and the son of Bahuläçva was Kåçäçva. The son of Kåçäçva was Senajit, and his son was Yuvanäçva."

In the forest, the sages performed a sacrifice known as Indra-yajïa on his behalf. Once, however, the King became so thirsty in the forest that he drank the water kept for performing yajïa. Consequently, after some time, a son came forth from the right side of his abdomen. The son, who was very beautiful, was crying to drink breast milk, and Indra gave the child his index finger to suck. Thus the son became known as Mändhätä. In due course of time, Yuvanäçva achieved perfection by performing austerities."

These sons were Purukutsa, Ambaréña and Mucukunda. These three sons had fifty sisters, all of whom became wives of the great sage known as Saubhari."

Later, Saubhari Muni became very regretful. Thus he accepted the order of vänaprastha, performed very severe austerities, and thus attained perfection. In this regard, Çukadeva Gosvämé described how Saubhari Muni's wives also became perfect."
