He thought that if he refused to carry out the order he would be cursed, but if he carried it out his father would be pleased, and when his father was pleased, Paraçuräma would ask the benediction of having his mother and brothers brought back to life. Paraçuräma was confident in this regard, and therefore he agreed to kill his mother and brothers."
