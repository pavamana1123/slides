This certainly was a sinful act, and therefore Jamadagni was killed by the sons of Kärtavéryärjuna, as described herein. Lord Paraçuräma was also infected by sin because of killing Kärtavéryärjuna, although this was not very offensive. Therefore, whether one be Kärtavéryärjuna, Lord Paraçuräma, Jamadagni or whoever one may be, one must act very cautiously and sagaciously; otherwise one must suffer the results of sinful activities. This is the lesson we receive from Vedic literature."
