From the history of Paraçuräma we can understand that although Paraçuräma belonged to the brahminical group, he circumstantially had to work as a kñatriya. Later, after finishing his work as a kñatriya, he again became a brähmaëa and returned to Mahendra-parvata. Similarly, we can see that although Viçvämitra was born in a kñatriya family, by austerities and penances he achieved the position of a brähmaëa. These histories confirm the statements in çästra that a brähmaëa may become a kñatriya, a kñatriya may become a brähmaëa or vaiçya, and a vaiçya may become a brähmaëa, by achieving the required qualities. One's status does not depend upon birth. As confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  by Närada:"

If all the unqualified çüdras become so-called brähmaëas and kñatriyas, social order will be impossible to maintain. Thus there will be discrepancies, human society will turn into a society of animals, and the situation all over the world will be hellish."
