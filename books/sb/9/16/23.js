Kåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëam: although He is Kåñëa Himself, He always chants Hare Kåñëa and preaches Kåñëa consciousness. One is recommended to worship this incarnation by chanting, the saìkértana-yajïa. The performance of saìkértana-yajïa is a special concession for human society to save people from being affected by known or unknown sinful activities. We are surrounded by unlimited sins, and therefore it is compulsory that one take to Kåñëa consciousness and chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra."
