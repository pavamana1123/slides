            "content": "When Jamadagni's wife, Reëukä, went to bring water from the Ganges and saw the King of the Gandharvas enjoying the company of Apsaräs, she was captivated, and she slightly desired to associate with him. Because of this sinful desire, she was punished by her husband. Paraçuräma killed his mother and brothers, but later, by dint of the austerities of Jamadagni, they were revived. The sons of Kärtavéryärjuna, however, remembering the death of their father, wanted to take revenge against Lord Paraçuräma, and therefore when Paraçuräma was absent from the äçrama, they killed Jamadagni, who was meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Paraçuräma returned to the äçrama and saw his father killed, he was very sorry, and after asking his brothers to take care of the dead body, he went out with determination to kill all the kñatriyas on the surface of the world. Taking up his axe, he went to Mähiñmaté-pura, the capital of Kärtavéryärjuna, and killed all of Kärtavéryärjuna's sons, whose blood became a great river. Paraçuräma, however, was not satisfied with killing only the sons of Kärtavéryärjuna; later, when the kñatriyas became disturbing, he killed them twenty-one times, so that there were no kñatriyas on the surface of the earth. Thereafter, Paraçuräma joined the head of his father to the dead body and performed various sacrifices to please the Supreme Lord. Thus Jamadagni got life again in his body, and later he was promoted to the higher planetary system known as Saptarñi-maëòala. Paraçuräma, the son of Jamadagni, still lives in Mahendra-parvata. In the next manvantara, he will become a preacher of Vedic knowledge."

            "content": "In the dynasty of Gädhi, the most powerful Viçvämitra took birth. By dint of his austerity and penance, he became a brähmaëa. He had 101 sons, who were celebrated as the Madhucchandäs. In the sacrificial arena of Hariçcandra, the son of Ajégarta named Çunaùçepha was meant to be sacrificed, but by the mercy of the Prajäpatis he was released. Thereafter, he became Devaräta in the dynasty of Gädhi. The fifty elder sons of Viçvämitra, however, did not accept Çunaùçepha as their elder brother, and therefore Viçvämitra cursed them to become mlecchas, unfaithful to the Vedic civilization. Viçvämitra's fifty-first son, along with his younger brothers, then accepted Çunaùçepha as their eldest brother, and their father, Viçvämitra, being satisfied, blessed them. Thus Devaräta was accepted in the dynasty of Kauçika, and consequently there are different divisions of that dynasty."
