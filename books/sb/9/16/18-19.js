    "translation": "With the blood of the bodies of these sons, Lord Paraçuräma created a ghastly river, which brought great fear to the kings who had no respect for brahminical culture. Because the kñatriyas, the men of power in government, were performing sinful activities, Lord Paraçuräma, on the plea of retaliating for the murder of his father, rid all the kñatriyas from the face of the earth twenty-one times. Indeed, in the place known as Samanta-païcaka he created nine lakes filled with their blood.",

According to the laws of nature, whether at the time of Paraçuräma or at the present, if the government becomes irresponsible and sinful, not caring for brahminical culture, there will certainly be an incarnation of God like Paraçuräma to create a devastation by fire, famine, pestilence or some other calamity. Whenever the government disrespects the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead and fails to protect the institution of varëäçrama-dharma, it will certainly have to face such catastrophes as formerly brought about by Lord Paraçuräma."
