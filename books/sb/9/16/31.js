When Hariçcandra was to sacrifice his son Rohita, Rohita arranged to save his own life by purchasing Çunaùçepha from Çunaùçepha's father to be sacrificed in the yajïa. Çunaùçepha was sold to Mahäräja Hariçcandra because he was the middle son, between the oldest and the youngest. It appears that the sacrifice of a man as an animal in yajïa has been practiced for a very long time."
