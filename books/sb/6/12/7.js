    "translation": "Våträsura continued: O Indra, no one is guaranteed of being always victorious but the original enjoyer, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän. He is the cause of creation, maintenance and annihilation, and He knows everything. Being dependent and being obliged to accept material bodies, belligerent subordinates are sometimes victorious and sometimes defeated.",

Victory or defeat is not actually theirs; it is an arrangement by the Lord through the agency of material nature. Pride in victory, or moroseness in defeat, is useless. One should fully depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is responsible for the victory and defeat of all living entities. The Lord advises, niyataà kuru karma tvaà karma jyäyo hy akarmaëaù: \"Perform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction.\" The living entity is ordered to act according to his position. Victory or defeat depends on the Supreme Lord. Karmaëy evädhikäras te mä phaleñu kadäcana: \"You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of actions.\" One must act sincerely, according to his position. Victory or defeat depends on the Lord."

When Kåñëa desires, you will certainly be victorious.\" This verse is very instructive for sincere workers in the Kåñëa consciousness movement. We should not be jubilant in victory or morose in defeat. We should make a sincere effort to implement the will of Kåñëa, or Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, and we should not be concerned with victory and defeat. Our only duty is to work sincerely, so that our activities may be recognized by Kåñëa."
