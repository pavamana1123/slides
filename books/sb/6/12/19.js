Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of the greatest difficulty.\" An unalloyed devotee is never disturbed by any kind of trying circumstance. Indra was surprised to see that Våträsura, undisturbed, was fixed in devotional service to the Lord, for such a mentality is impossible for a demon. However, by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, anyone can become an exalted devotee (striyo vaiçyäs tathä çüdräs te 'pi yänti paräà gatim). An unalloyed devotee is sure to return home, back to Godhead."
