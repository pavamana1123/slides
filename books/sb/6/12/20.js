It is said in the Padma Puräëa that the distinction between a demigod and a demon is that a demigod is a devotee of Lord Viñëu whereas a demon is just the opposite: viñëu-bhaktaù småto daiva äsuras tad-viparyayaù. Våträsura was considered a demon, but actually he was more than qualified as a devotee, or mahä-pauruñya. If one somehow becomes a devotee of the Supreme Lord, whatever his position, he can be brought to the position of a perfect person. This is possible if an unalloyed devotee tries to serve the Lord by delivering him in this way. Therefore Çukadeva Gosvämé says in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.\" Anyone can be purified if he takes shelter of a pure devotee and molds his character according to the pure devotee's direction. Then, even if one is a Kiräta, Ändhra, Pulinda or whatever, he can be purified and elevated to the position of a mahä-pauruñya."
