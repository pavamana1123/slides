Nevertheless, Våträsura used his remaining arm to strike Indra with an iron mace, making the thunderbolt fall from Indra's hand. Indra, being very ashamed of this, did not pick up the thunderbolt from the ground, but Våträsura encouraged King Indra to pick it up and fight. Våträsura then spoke to King Indra as follows, instructing him very well."

Not knowing that the Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes, fools and rascals try to take credit for victory or defeat themselves, but everything is actually under the control of the Lord. No one but Him has any independence. The puruña (the enjoyer) and prakåti (the enjoyed) are under the control of the Lord, for it is by His supervision that everything works systematically. Not seeing the hand of the Supreme in every action, a fool considers himself the ruler and controller of everything. When one understands, however, that the real controller is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is freed from the relativities of the world, such as distress, happiness, fear and impurity.\" Thus Indra and Våträsura not only fought, but also engaged in philosophical discourses. Then they began to fight again."

Våträsura then assumed a gigantic form and swallowed King Indra, but Indra, being protected by the talisman known as Näräyaëa-kavaca, was able to protect himself even within Våträsura's body. Thus he emerged from Våträsura's abdomen and severed the demon's head from his body with his powerful thunderbolt. Severing the demon's head took one complete year to accomplish."
