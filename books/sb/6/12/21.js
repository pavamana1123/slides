    "translation": "O Våträsura, demons are generally conducted by the mode of passion. Therefore, what a great wonder it is that although you are a demon, you have adopted the mentality of a devotee and have fixed your mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva, who is always situated in pure goodness.",

As for Prahläda Mahäräja, he was initiated by Närada Muni, and therefore it was possible for him to become a great devotee, although he was born in a family of demons. For Våträsura, however, Indra could not detect such causes. Therefore he was struck with wonder that Våträsura was such an exalted devotee that he could fix his mind without deviation upon the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa, Väsudeva."
