    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: Desiring to give up his body, Våträsura considered death in the battle preferable to victory. O King Parékñit, he vigorously took up his trident and with great force attacked Lord Indra, the King of heaven, just as Kaiöabha had forcefully attacked the Supreme Personality of Godhead when the universe was inundated.",

Våträsura, disappointed that King Indra was reluctant despite his encouragement, took the initiative very forcefully by throwing his trident at Indra. Våträsura was not at all interested in victory; he was interested in being killed so that he could immediately return home, back to Godhead. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä , tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti: after giving up his body, a devotee immediately returns to Lord Kåñëa and never returns to accept another body. This was Våträsura's interest."
