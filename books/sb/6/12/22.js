I simply want to return home, back to Godhead.\" This is the determination of a pure devotee. A pure devotee is never attracted to any exalted position within this material world. He simply wants to associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead like the inhabitants of Våndävana—Çrématé Rädhäräëé, the gopés, Kåñëa's father and mother (Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä), Kåñëa's friends and Kåñëa's servants. He wants to associate with Kåñëa's atmosphere of Våndävana's beauty. These are the highest ambitions of a devotee of Kåñëa. Devotees of Lord Viñëu may aspire for a position in Vaikuëöhaloka, but a devotee of Kåñëa never aspires even for the facilities of Vaikuëöha; he wants to return to Goloka Våndävana and associate with Lord Kåñëa in His eternal pastimes. Any material happiness is like water in a ditch, whereas the spiritual happiness eternally enjoyed in the spiritual world is like an ocean of nectar in which a devotee wants to swim."
