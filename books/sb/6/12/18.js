He was struck with wonder that a demon could speak so intelligently. Then he remembered great devotees like Prahläda Mahäräja and Bali Mahäräja, who had been born in the families of demons, and thus he came to his senses. Even so-called demons sometimes have exalted devotion for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore Indra smiled reassuringly at Våträsura."
