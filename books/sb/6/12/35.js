He says that when Våträsura swallowed King Indra and his carrier, the elephant, he thought, \"Now I have killed Indra, and therefore there is no more need of fighting. Now let me return home, back to Godhead.\" Thus he stopped all his bodily activities and became situated in trance. Taking advantage of the silence of Våträsura's body, Indra pierced the demon's abdomen, and because of Våträsura's trance, Indra was able to come out. Now, Våträsura was in yoga-samadhi, and therefore although King Indra wanted to cut his throat, the demon's neck was so stiff that Indra's thunderbolt took 360 days to cut it to pieces. Actually it was the body left by Våträsura that was cut to pieces by Indra; Våträsura himself was not killed. In his original consciousness, Våträsura returned home, back to Godhead, to become an associate of Lord Saìkarñaëa. Here the word alokam means the transcendental world, Vaikuëöhaloka, where Saìkarñaëa eternally resides."
