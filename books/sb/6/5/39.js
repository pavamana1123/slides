    "translation": "All the devotees of the Lord but you are very kind to the conditioned souls and are eager to benefit others. Although you wear the dress of a devotee, you create enmity with people who are not your enemies, or you break friendship and create enmity between friends. Are you not ashamed of posing as a devotee while performing these abominable actions?",

Through the Kåñëa consciousness movement, we are trying to train young people to become devotees and return home, back to Godhead, by following rigid regulative principles, but our service is appreciated neither in India nor abroad in the Western countries where we are endeavoring to spread this Kåñëa consciousness movement. In India the caste brähmaëas have become enemies of the Kåñëa consciousness movement because we elevate foreigners, who are supposed to be mlecchas and yavanas, to the position of brähmaëas. We train them in austerities and penances and recognize them as brähmaëas by awarding them sacred threads. Thus the caste brähmaëas of India are very displeased by our activities in the Western world. In the West also, the parents of the young people who join this movement have also become enemies. We have no business creating enemies, but the process is such that nondevotees will always be inimical toward us. Nevertheless, as stated in the çästras, a devotee should be both tolerant and merciful. Devotees engaged in preaching should be prepared to be accused by ignorant persons, and yet they must be very merciful to the fallen conditioned souls. If one can execute his duty in the disciplic succession of Närada Muni, his service will surely be recognized. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä :"

            "content": "In this verse the word sauhåda-ghnam (\"a breaker of friendship\") is used. Because Närada Muni and the members of his disciplic succession disrupt friendships and family life, they are sometimes accused of being sauhåda-ghnam, creators of enmity between relatives. Actually such devotees are friends of every living entity (suhådaà sarva-bhütänäm ), but they are misunderstood to be enemies. Preaching can be a difficult, thankless task, but a preacher must follow the orders of the Supreme Lord and be unafraid of materialistic persons."
