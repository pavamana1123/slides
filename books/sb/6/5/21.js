They all believed in his instructions and reached the same conclusion. Having accepted him as their spiritual master, they circumambulated that great sage and followed the path by which one never returns to this world.",

The spiritual master never instructs his disciple, \"Take a mantra from me, pay me some money, and by practicing this yoga system you will become very expert in materialistic life.\" This is not the duty of a spiritual master. Rather, the spiritual master teaches the disciple how to give up materialistic life, and the disciple's duty is to assimilate his instructions and ultimately follow the path back home, back to Godhead, from whence no one returns to this material world."

This would have been unnecessarily entangling. The Haryaçvas did not consider pious and impious activities. Their materialistic father had instructed them to increase the population, but because of the words of Närada Muni, they could not heed that instruction. Närada Muni, as their spiritual master, gave them the çästric instructions that they should give up this material world, and as bona fide disciples they followed his instructions. One should not endeavor to wander to different planetary systems within this universe, for even if one goes to the topmost planetary system, Brahmaloka, one must return again (kñéëe puëye martya-lokaà viçanti :"
