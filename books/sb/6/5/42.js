    "translation": "Although I live in household life with my wife and children, I honestly follow the Vedic injunctions by engaging in fruitive activities to enjoy life without sinful reactions. I have performed all kinds of yajïas, including the deva-yajïa, åñi-yajïa, pitå-yajïa and nå-yajïa. Because these yajïas are called vratas [vows], I am known as a gåhavrata. Unfortunately, you have given me great displeasure by misguiding my sons, for no reason, to the path of renunciation. This can be tolerated once.",

Sometimes householders are accused of being gåhamedhés, for gåhamedhés are satisfied with family life without spiritual advancement. Gåhasthas, however, are different because although gåhasthas live in householder life with their wives and children, they are eager for spiritual advancement. Wanting to prove that he had been magnanimous to Närada Muni, Prajäpati Dakña stressed that when Närada had misled his first sons, Dakña had taken no action; he had been kind and tolerant. He was aggrieved, however, because Närada Muni had misled his sons for a second time. Therefore he wanted to prove that Närada Muni, although dressed like a sädhu, was not actually a sädhu; he himself, although a householder, was a greater sädhu than Närada Muni."
