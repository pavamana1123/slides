These sons, who were all of the same character and mentality, were known as the Haryaçvas. Ordered by their father to create more and more population, the Haryaçvas went west to the place where the River Sindhu (now the Indus) meets the Arabian Sea. In those days this was the site of a holy lake named Näräyaëa-saras, where there were many saintly persons. The Haryaçvas began practicing austerities, penances and meditation, which are the engagements of the highly exalted renounced order of life. However, when Çréla Närada Muni saw these boys engaged in such commendable austerities simply for material creation, he thought it better to release them from this tendency. Närada Muni described to the boys their ultimate goal of life and advised them not to become ordinary karmés to beget children. Thus all the sons of Dakña became enlightened and left, never to return."

These sons, who were named the Savaläçvas, also engaged in worshiping Lord Viñëu to beget children, but Närada Muni convinced them to become mendicants and not beget children. Foiled twice in his attempts to increase population, Prajäpati Dakña became most angry at Närada Muni and cursed him, saying that in the future he would not be able to stay anywhere. Since Närada Muni, being fully qualified, was fixed in tolerance, he accepted Dakña's curse."
