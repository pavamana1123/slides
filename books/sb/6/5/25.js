He did not hesitate to send his second group of sons to the same place, although they too might become victims of Närada's instructions. According to the Vedic culture, one should be trained in spiritual understanding as a brahmacäré before entering household life to beget children. This is the Vedic system. Thus Prajäpati Dakña sent his second group of sons for cultural improvement, despite the risk that because of the instructions of Närada they might become as intelligent as their older brothers. As a dutiful father, he did not hesitate to allow his sons to receive cultural instructions concerning the perfection of life; he depended upon them to choose whether to return home, back to Godhead, or to rot in this material world in various species of life. In all circumstances, the duty of the father is to give cultural education to his sons, who must later decide which way to go. Responsible fathers should not hinder their sons who are making cultural advancement in association with the Kåñëa consciousness movement. This is not a father's duty. The duty of a father is to give his son complete freedom to make his choice after becoming spiritually advanced by following the instructions of the spiritual master."
