    "translation": "[Närada Muni had asked how one could ignorantly defy one's own father. The Haryaçvas understood the meaning of this question.] One must accept the original instructions of the çästra. According to Vedic civilization, one is offered a sacred thread as a sign of second birth. One takes his second birth by dint of having received instructions in the çästra from a bona fide spiritual master. Therefore, çästra, scripture, is the real father. All the çästras instruct that one should end his material way of life. If one does not know the purpose of the father's orders, the çästras, he is ignorant. The words of a material father who endeavors to engage his son in material activities are not the real instructions of the father.",

In the material world, every living entity has a desire to lord it over the material world as much as possible. This is called pravåtti-märga. All the çästras, however, advise nivåtti-märga, or release from the materialistic way of life. Apart from the çästras of the Vedic civilization, which is the oldest of the world, other çästras agree on this point. For example, in the Buddhist çästras Lord Buddha advises that one achieve nirväëa by giving up the materialistic way of life. In the Bible, which is also çästra, one will find the same advice: one should cease materialistic life and return to the kingdom of God. In any çästra one may examine, especially the Vedic çästra, the same advice is given: one should give up his materialistic life and return to his original, spiritual life. Çaìkaräcärya also propounds the same conclusion. Brahma satyaà jagan mithyä: this material world or materialistic life is simply illusion, and therefore one should stop his illusory activities and come to the platform of Brahman."

The Vedas-Säma, Yajur, Åg and Atharva—and any other books deriving knowledge from these Vedas are considered Vedic literatures. Bhagavad-gétä is the essence of all Vedic knowledge, and therefore it is the scripture whose instructions should be especially accepted. In this essence of all çästras, Kåñëa personally advises that one give up all other duties and surrender unto Him (sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja )."

In offering initiation, our Kåñëa consciousness movement asks one to come to the conclusion of çästra by taking the advice of the supreme speaker of the çästra, Kåñëa, forgetting the principles of the materialistic way of life. Therefore the principles we advise are no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling and no meat-eating. These four types of engagement will enable an intelligent person to get free from the materialistic life and return home, back to Godhead."

Therefore, getting a material father and mother is not a problem. In every form of life, birth after birth, the living entity gets a father and mother. In human society, however, if one is satisfied with his material father and mother and their instructions and does not make further progress by accepting a spiritual master and being educated in the çästras, he certainly remains in darkness. The material father and mother are important only if they are interested in educating their son to become free from the clutches of death. As instructed by Åñabhadeva : pitä na sa syäj janané na sä syät/ na mocayed yaù samupeta-måtyum. One should not strive to become a mother or father if one cannot save one's dependent son from the impending danger of death. A parent who does not know how to save his son has no value because such fathers and mothers may be had in any form of life, even among the cats, dogs and so on. Only a father and mother who can elevate their son to the spiritual platform are bona fide parents. Therefore according to the Vedic system it is said, janmanä jäyate çüdraù: one is born of a material father and mother as a çüdra. The purpose of life, however, is to become a brähmaëa, a first-class man."

If the Kåñëa consciousness movement spreads, the so-called businessmen will have to close their slaughterhouses, breweries and cigarette factories. Therefore they are also very much afraid. However, we have no alternative than to teach our disciples to free themselves from materialistic life.
