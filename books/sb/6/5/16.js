    "translation": "[Närada Muni had said that there is a river flowing in both directions. The Haryaçvas understood the purport of this statement.] Material nature functions in two ways—by creation and dissolution. Thus the river of material nature flows both ways. A living entity who unknowingly falls in this river is submerged in its waves, and since the current is swifter near the banks of the river, he is unable to get out. What will be the benefit of performing fruitive activities in that river of mäyä?",

When one falls in the river of nescience, he is always tossed here and there by the waves, but the same mäyä can also save him when be surrenders to Kåñëa, or becomes Kåñëa conscious. Kåñëa consciousness is knowledge and austerity. A Kåñëa conscious person takes knowledge from the Vedic literature, and at the same time he must practice austerities."

Otherwise, if one very busily engages in the so-called advancement of science, what benefit will he derive? If one is carried away by the waves of nature, what is the meaning of being a great scientist or philosopher? Mundane science and philosophy are also material creations. One must understand how mäyä works and how one can be released from the tossing waves of the river of nescience. That is one's first duty."
