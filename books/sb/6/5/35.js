He had delivered Uttänapäda's son Dhruva and had even delivered Präcénabarhi, who was engaged in fruitive activities. Nevertheless, he could not deliver Prajäpati Dakña. Prajäpati Dakña saw Närada before him because Närada had personally come to deliver him. Närada Muni took the opportunity to approach Prajäpati Dakña in his bereavement because the time of bereavement is a suitable time for appreciating bhakti-yoga. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , four kinds of men—ärta (one who is distressed), arthärthé (one in need of money), jijïäsu (one who is inquisitive) and jïäné (a person in knowledge)—try to understand devotional service. Prajäpati Dakña was in great distress because of the loss of his sons, and therefore Närada took the opportunity to instruct him regarding liberation from material bondage."
