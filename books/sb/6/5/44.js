In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.\" Following the orders of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, one who preaches the glories of the Lord all over the world or all over the universe should be humbler than grass and more tolerant than a tree because a preacher cannot live an easygoing life. Indeed, a preacher must face many impediments. Not only is he sometimes cursed, but sometimes he must also suffer personal injury. For example, when Nityänanda Prabhu went to preach Kåñëa consciousness to the two roguish brothers Jagäi and Mädhäi, they injured Him and made His head bleed, but nevertheless, He tolerantly delivered the two rogues, who became perfect Vaiñëavas. This is the duty of a preacher. Lord Jesus Christ even tolerated crucifixion. Therefore the curse against Närada was not very astonishing, and he tolerated it."

            "content": "Now, it may be asked why Närada Muni stayed in the presence of Prajäpati Dakña and tolerated all his accusations and curses. Was that for Dakña's deliverance? The answer is yes. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says that after being insulted by Prajäpati Dakña, Närada Muni should have left immediately, but he purposely stayed to hear all Dakña's strong words so that Dakña might be relieved of his anger. Prajäpati Dakña was not an ordinary man; he had accumulated the results of many pious activities. Therefore Närada Muni expected that after delivering his curse, Dakña, satisfied and freed from anger, would repent his misbehavior and thus get a chance to become a Vaiñëava and be delivered. When Jagäi and Mädhäi offended Lord Nityänanda, Lord Nityänanda stood tolerantly, and therefore both brothers fell at His lotus feet and repented. Consequently they later became perfect Vaiñëavas."
