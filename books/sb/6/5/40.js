The sannyäsés of Kali-yuga who change their robes from white to saffron and then think they can do whatever they like are more abominable than materialistic gåhasthas. This is not recommended anywhere. Prajäpati Dakña was right in pointing out this defect, but he did not know that Närada Muni had aroused the spirit of renunciation in the Haryaçvas and Savaläçvas through full knowledge. Such enlightened renunciation is desirable. One should enter the renounced order with full knowledge (jïäna-vairägya), for the perfection of life is possible for one who renounces this material world in that way. This elevated stage can be reached very easily, as supported by the statements of Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

There is no doubt of this. Prajäpati Dakña's accusation that Närada had not actually elevated his sons to the platform of knowledge was not factual. All the sons of Prajäpati Dakña had first been raised to the platform of jïäna and had then automatically renounced this world. In summary, unless one's knowledge is awakened, renunciation cannot take place, for without elevated knowledge one cannot give up attachment for material enjoyment."
