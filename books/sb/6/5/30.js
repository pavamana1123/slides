He urged them to follow their older brothers if they were at all affectionate toward them. Family affection is very strong, and therefore Närada Muni followed this tactic of reminding them of their family relationship with the Haryaçvas. Generally the word nigama refers to the Vedas, but here nigama refers to the instructions contained in the Vedas. Çrémad-Bhägavatam says, nigama-kalpa-taror galitaà phalam:  the Vedic instructions are like a tree, of which Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the ripened fruit. Närada Muni is engaged in distributing this fruit, and therefore he instructed Vyäsadeva to write this Mahä-Puräëa, Çrémad-Bhägavatam, for the benefit of ignorant human society."

But the mass of people do not know this, and therefore the learned Vyäsadeva compiled this Vedic literature, which is in relation to the Supreme Truth.\"  People are suffering because of ignorance and are following a wrong path for happiness. This is called anartha. These material activities will never make them happy, and therefore Närada instructed Vyäsadeva to record the instructions of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Vyäsadeva actually followed Närada and did this. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the supreme instruction of the Vedas. Galitaà phalam: the ripened fruit of the Vedas is Çrémad-Bhägavatam."
