            "content": "Because Prajäpati Dakña was a gåhamedhé who wanted to remain in household life, he thought that if Närada Muni could not remain in one place, but had to travel all over the world, that would be a great punishment for him. Actually, however, such a punishment is a boon for a preacher. A preacher is known as parivräjakäcärya—an äcärya, or teacher, who always travels for the benefit of human society. Prajäpati Dakña cursed Närada Muni by saying that although he had the facility to travel all over the universe, he would never be able to stay in one place. In the paramparä system from Närada Muni, I have also been cursed. Although I have many centers that would be suitable places of residence, I cannot stay anywhere, for I have been cursed by the parents of my young disciples. Since the Kåñëa consciousness movement was started, I have traveled all over the world two or three times a year, and although I am provided comfortable places to stay wherever I go, I cannot stay anywhere for more than three days or a week. I do not mind this curse by the parents of my disciples, but now it is necessary that I stay in one place to finish another task—this translation of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. If my young disciples, especially those who have taken sannyäsa, take charge of traveling all over the world, it may be possible for me to transfer the curse of the parents to these young preachers. Then I may sit down conveniently in one place for the work of translation."
