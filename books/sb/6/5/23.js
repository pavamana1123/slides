    "translation": "The Haryaçvas, the sons of Prajäpati Dakña, were very well behaved, cultured sons, but unfortunately, because of the instructions of Närada Muni, they deviated from the order of their father. When Dakña heard this news, which was brought to him by Närada Muni, he began to lament. Although he was the father of such good sons, he had lost them all. Certainly this was lamentable.",

            "content": "The Haryaçvas, the sons of Prajäpati Dakña, were certainly well behaved, learned and advanced, and in accordance with the order of their father they went to perform austerities to beget good sons for their family. But Närada Muni took advantage of their good behavior and culture to properly direct them not to be involved with this material world, but to use their culture and knowledge to end their material affairs. The Haryaçvas abided by the order of Närada Muni, but when news of this was brought to Prajäpati Dakña, the prajäpati, instead of being happy with the actions of Närada Muni, was extremely sorrowful. Similarly, we are trying to bring as many young men as possible to the Kåñëa consciousness movement for their ultimate benefit, but the parents of the young men joining this movement, being very sorry, are lamenting and making counterpropaganda. Of course, Prajäpati Dakña did not make propaganda against Närada Muni, but later, as we shall see, Dakña cursed Närada Muni for his benevolent activities. This is the way of materialistic life. A materialistic father and mother want to engage their sons in begetting children, striving for improved economic conditions and rotting in materialistic life. They are not unhappy when their children become spoiled, useless citizens, but they lament when they join the Kåñëa consciousness movement to achieve the ultimate goal of life. This animosity between parents and the Kåñëa consciousness movement has existed since time immemorial. Even Närada Muni was condemned, not to speak of others. Nevertheless, Närada Muni never gives up his mission. To deliver as many fallen souls as possible, he continues playing his musical instrument and vibrating the transcendental sound Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare."
