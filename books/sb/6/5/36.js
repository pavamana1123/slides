In society one will find many sannyäsés, vänaprasthas, gåhasthas and brahmacärés, but if all of them properly live in accordance with their duties, they are understood to be sädhus. Prajäpati Dakña was certainly a sädhu because he had executed such great austerities that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viñëu, had appeared before him. Nevertheless, he had a fault-finding mentality. He improperly thought Närada Muni to be asädhu, or nonsaintly, because Närada had foiled his intentions. Desiring to train his sons to become gåhasthas fully equipped with knowledge, Dakña had sent them to execute austerities by Näräyaëa-saras. Närada Muni, however, taking advantage of their highly elevated position in austerity, instructed them to become Vaiñëavas in the renounced order. This is the duty of Närada Muni and his followers. They must show everyone the path of renouncing this material world and returning home, back to Godhead. Prajäpati Dakña, however, could not see the exaltedness of the duties Närada Muni performed in relation to his sons. Unable to appreciate Närada Muni's behavior, Dakña accused Närada of being asädhu."

            "content": "The words bhikñor märga, \"the path of the renounced order,\" are very significant in this regard. A sannyäsé is called tridaëòi-bhikñu because his duty is to beg alms from the homes of gåhasthas and to give the gåhasthas spiritual instructions. A sannyäsé is allowed to beg from door to door, but a gåhastha cannot do so. Gåhasthas may earn their living according to the four divisions of spiritual life. A brähmaëa gåhastha may earn his livelihood by becoming a learned scholar and teaching people in general how to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He may also assume the duty of worship himself. Therefore it is said that only brähmaëas may engage in Deity worship, and they may accept as prasäda whatever people offer the Deity. Although a brähmaëa may sometimes accept charity, it is not for his personal maintenance but for the worship of the Deity. Thus a brähmaëa does not stock anything for his future use. Similarly, kñatriyas may collect taxes from the citizens, and they must also protect the citizens, enforce rules and regulations, and maintain law and order. Vaiçyas should earn their livelihood through agriculture and cow protection, and çüdras should maintain their livelihood by serving the three higher classes. Unless one becomes a brähmaëa, one cannot take sannyäsa. Sannyäsés and brahmacärés may beg alms door to door, but a gåhastha cannot."

Dakña was extremely angry at Närada because he thought that Närada had done him a great injustice. According to Dakña's opinion, Närada Muni had misled Dakña's inexperienced sons (asädhv akäry arbhakäëäm). Dakña regarded his sons as innocent boys who had been misled when Närada showed them the renounced order of life. Because of all these considerations, Prajäpati Dakña charged that Närada Muni was asädhu and should not have adopted the dress of a sädhu."

            "content": "Sometimes a saintly person is misunderstood by gåhasthas, especially when he instructs their young sons to accept Kåñëa consciousness. Generally a gåhastha thinks that unless one enters gåhastha life he cannot properly enter the renounced order. If a young man immediately adopts the path of the renounced order in accordance with the instructions of Närada or a member of his disciplic succession, his parents become very angry. This same phenomenon is occurring in our Kåñëa consciousness movement because we are instructing all the young boys in the Western countries to follow the path of renunciation. We allow gåhastha life, but a gåhastha also follows the path of renunciation. Even a gåhastha has to give up so many bad habits that his parents think his life has been practically destroyed. We allow no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication, and consequently the parents wonder how, if there are so many no's, one's life can be positive. In the Western countries especially, these four prohibited activities practically constitute the life and soul of the modern population. Therefore parents sometimes dislike our movement, just as Prajäpati Dakña disliked the activities of Närada and accused Närada of dishonesty. Nevertheless, although parents may be angry at us, we must perform our duty without hesitation because we are in the disciplic succession from Närada Muni."

They do not know that the householder's concession for sex life cannot be regulated unless one accepts the life of a mendicant. The Vedic civilization therefore enjoins that at the end of one's fiftieth year one must give up household life. This is compulsory. However, because modern civilization is misled, householders want to remain in family life until death, and therefore they are suffering. In such cases, the disciples of Närada Muni advise all the members of the younger generation to join the Kåñëa consciousness movement immediately. There is nothing wrong in this."
