    "translation": "[Närada Muni had described that there is a bila, or hole, from which, having entered, one does not return. The Haryaçvas understood the meaning of this allegory.] Hardly once has a person who has entered the lower planetary system called Pätäla been seen to return. Similarly, if one enters the Vaikuëöha-dhäma [pratyag-dhäma], he does not return to this material world. If there is such a place, from which, having gone, one does not return to the miserable material condition of life, what is the use of jumping like monkeys in the temporary material world and not seeing or understanding that place? What will be the profit?",

This fact has been described in this verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Pumän naivaiti yad gatvä: he does not return to this material world, but returns home, back to Godhead, to live an eternally blissful life of knowledge. Why do people not care about this? What will be the benefit of taking birth again in this material world, sometimes as a human being, sometimes a demigod and sometimes a cat or dog? What is the benefit of wasting time in this way? Kåñëa has very definitely asserted in Bhagavad-gétä :"
