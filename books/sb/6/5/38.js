    "translation": "Prajäpati Dakña continued: Thus committing violence against other living entities and yet claiming to be an associate of Lord Viñëu, you are defaming the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You needlessly created a mentality of renunciation in innocent boys, and therefore you are shameless and devoid of compassion. How could you travel with the personal associates of the Supreme Lord?",

            "content": "This mentality of Prajäpati Dakña still continues even today. When young boys join the Kåñëa consciousness movement, their fathers and so-called guardians are very angry at the propounder of the Kåñëa consciousness movement because they think that their sons have been unnecessarily induced to deprive themselves of the material enjoyments of eating, drinking and merrymaking. Karmés, fruitive workers, think that one should fully enjoy his present life in this material world and also perform some pious activities to be promoted to higher planetary systems for further enjoyment in the next life. A yogé, however, especially a bhakti-yogé, is callous to the opinions of this material world. He is not interested in traveling to the higher planetary systems of the demigods to enjoy a long life in an advanced materialistic civilization. As stated by Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté, kaivalyaà narakäyate tridaça-pür äkäça-puñpäyate: for a devotee, merging into the Brahman existence is hellish, and life in the higher planetary systems of the demigods is a will-o'-the-wisp, a phantasmagoria with no real existence at all. A pure devotee is not interested in yogic perfection, travel to higher planetary systems, or oneness with Brahman. He is interested only in rendering service to the Personality of Godhead. Since Prajäpati Dakña was a karmé, he could not appreciate the great service Närada Muni had rendered his eleven thousand sons. Instead, he accused Närada Muni of being sinful and charged that because Närada Muni was associated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord would also be defamed. Thus Dakña criticized that Närada Muni was an offender to the Lord although he was known as an associate of the Lord."
