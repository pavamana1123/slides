(The word dakña means \"expert.\") First he begot ten thousand children in the womb of his wife, and when the children were lost—when they returned home, back to Godhead—he begot another set of children, known as the Savaläçvas. Prajäpati Dakña is very expert in begetting children, and Närada Muni is very expert in delivering all the conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead. Therefore the materialistic experts do not agree with the spiritual expert Närada Muni. but this does not mean that Närada Muni will give up his engagement of chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra."
