    "translation": "Prajäpati Dakña said: My sons were not at all freed from their three debts. Indeed, they did not properly consider their obligations. O Närada Muni, O personality of sinful action, you have obstructed their progress toward good fortune in this world and the next because they are still indebted to the saintly persons, the demigods and their father.",

The son of a brähmaëa must undergo celibacy (brahmacarya) to clear his debts to the saintly persons, he must perform ritualistic ceremonies to clear his debts to the demigods, and he must beget children to become free from his debts to his father. Prajäpati Dakña argued that although the renounced order is recommended for liberation, one cannot attain liberation unless one fulfills his obligations to the demigods, the saints and his father. Since Dakña's sons had not liberated themselves from these three debts, how could Närada Muni have led them to the renounced order of life? Apparently, Prajäpati Dakña did not know the final decision of the çästras. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

            "content": "Everyone is indebted to the demigods, to living entities in general, to his family, to the pitäs and so on, but if one fully surrenders to Kåñëa, Mukunda, who can give one liberation, even if one performs no yajïas, one is freed from all debts. Even if one does not repay his debts, he is freed from all debts if he renounces the material world for the sake of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose lotus feet are the shelter of everyone. This is the verdict of the çästra. Therefore Närada Muni was completely right in instructing the sons of Prajäpati Dakña to renounce this material world immediately and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unfortunately, Prajäpati Dakña, the father of the Haryaçvas and Savaläçvas, did not understand the great service rendered by Närada Muni. Dakña therefore addressed him as päpa (the personality of sinful activities) and asädhu (a nonsaintly person). Since Närada Muni was a great saint and Vaiñëava, he tolerated all such accusations from Prajäpati Dakña. He merely performed his duty as a Vaiñëava by delivering all the sons of Prajäpati Dakña, enabling them to return home, back to Godhead."
