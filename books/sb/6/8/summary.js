One should observe silence and then place the eight-syllable Viñëu mantra on the parts of his body and place the twelve-syllable mantra on his hands. The eight-syllable mantra is oà namo näräyaëäya. This mantra should be distributed all over the front and back of the body. The twelve-syllable mantra, which begins with the praëava, oàkära, is oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya. One syllable should be placed on each of the fingers and should be preceded by the praëava, oàkära. Thereafter, one must chant oà viñëave namaù, which is a six-syllable mantra. One must progressively place the syllables of the mantra on the heart, the head, between the two eyebrows, on the çikhä and between the eyes, and then one should chant maù asträya phaö and with this mantra protect himself from all directions. Nädevo devam arcayet: one who has not risen to the level of a deva cannot chant this mantra. According to this direction of the çästra, one must think himself qualitatively nondifferent from the Supreme."

One also has to think of the fish incarnation, Vämana, Kürma, Nåsiàha, Varäha, Paraçuräma, Rämacandra (the elder brother of Lakñmaëa). Nara-Näräyaëa, Dattätreya (an empowered incarnation), Kapila, Sanat-kumära, Hayagréva, Näradadeva (the incarnation of a devotee). Dhanvantari, Åñabhadeva, Yajïa, Balaräma, Vyäsadeva, Buddhadeva and Keçava. One should also think of Govinda, the master of Våndävana, and one should think of Näräyaëa, the master of the spiritual sky. One should think of Madhusüdana, Tridhämä, Mädhava, Håñékeça, Padmanäbha, Janärdana, Dämodara and Viçveçvara, as well as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa Himself. After offering prayers to the Lord's personal expansions known as the sväàça and çaktyäveça-avatäras, one should pray to the weapons of Lord Näräyaëa, such as the Sudarçana, gadä, çaìkha, khaòga and bow."
