For example, undesirable food poses a danger to health, and therefore one must give up such food. The Dhanvantari incarnation can protect us in this regard. Since Lord Viñëu is the Supersoul of all living entities, if He likes He can save us from adhibhautika disturbances, disturbances from other living entities. Lord Balaräma is the Çeña incarnation, and therefore He can save us from angry serpents or envious persons, who are always ready to attack."
