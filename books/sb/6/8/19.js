May Lord Buddhadeva protect me from activities opposed to Vedic principles and from laziness that causes one to madly forget the Vedic principles of knowledge and ritualistic action. May Kalkideva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as an incarnation to protect religious principles, protect me from the dirt of the age of Kali.",

Çréla Vyäsadeva, Mahämuni, compiled the Vedic literature for the benefit of all human society. If one wants to be protected from the reactions of ignorance even in this age of Kali, one may consult the books left by Çréla Vyäsadeva, Upaniñads, Vedänta-sütra (Brahma-sütra), Mahäbhärata, Çrémad-Bhägavatam Mahä-Puräëa (Vyäsadeva's commentary on the Brahma-sütra) and the other seventeen Puräëas. Only by the mercy of Çréla Vyäsadeva do we have so many volumes of transcendental knowledge to save us from the clutches of ignorance."

When päñaëòés were cheating by killing animals on the plea of sacrificing them in Vedic yajïas, the Lord said, \"If the Vedic injunctions allow animal killing, I do not accept the Vedic principles.\" Thus he actually saved people who acted according to Vedic principles. One should therefore surrender to Lord Buddha so that he can help one avoid misusing the injunctions of the Vedas."

Now, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, many irreligious principles are in effect, and as Kali-yuga advances, many pseudo religious principles will certainly be introduced, and people will forget the real religious principles enunciated by Lord Kåñëa before the beginning of Kali-yuga, namely principles of surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Unfortunately, because of Kali-yuga, foolish people do not surrender to the lotus feet of Kåñëa. Even most people who claim to belong to the Vedic system of religion are actually opposed to the Vedic principles. Every day they manufacture a new type of dharma on the plea that whatever one manufactures is also a path of liberation. Atheistic men generally say, yata mata tata patha. According to this view, there are hundreds and thousands of different opinions in human society, and each opinion is a valid religious principle. This philosophy of rascals has killed the religious principles mentioned in the Vedas, and such philosophies will become increasingly influential as Kali-yuga progresses. In the last stage of Kali-yuga, Kalkideva, the fierce incarnation of Keçava, will descend to kill all the atheists and will save only the devotees of the Lord."
