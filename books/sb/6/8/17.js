Therefore those who are very much influenced by lusty desires are advised to take shelter of Sanat-kumära, the great brahmacäré devotee. Närada Muni, who is the guide for arcana, is the author of the Närada-païcarätra, which prescribes the regulative principles for worshiping the Deity. Everyone engaged in Deity worship, whether at home or in the temple, should always seek the mercy of Devarñi Närada in order to avoid the thirty-two offenses while worshiping the Deity. These offenses in Deity worship are mentioned in The Nectar of Devotion."
