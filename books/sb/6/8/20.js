Generally, each day and each night is divided into six parts consisting of five ghaöikäs. In each of these six portions of the day and night, the Lord may be addressed for protection according to different names. Lord Keçava, the proprietor of the holy place of Mathurä, is the Lord of the first portion of the day, and Govinda, the Lord of Våndävana. is the master of the second portion."
