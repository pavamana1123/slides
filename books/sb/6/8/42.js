In the Padma Puräëa it is also said, sampradäya-vihénä ye manträs te niñphalä matäù. There are four sampradäyas, or disciplic successions, namely the Brahma-sampradäya, the Rudra-sampradäya, the Çré sampradäya and the Kumära-sampradäya. If one wants to advance in spiritual power, one must receive his mantras from one of these bona fide sampradäyas; otherwise he will never successfully advance in spiritual life."
