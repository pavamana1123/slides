Speaking very bravely, he stood alone to face the demigods. When the demigods saw Våträsura's attitude, they were so afraid that they practically fainted, and Våträsura began trampling them down. Unable to tolerate this, Indra, the King of the demigods, threw his club at Våträsura, but Våträsura was such a great hero that he easily caught the club with his left hand and used it to beat Indra's elephant. Struck by the blow of Våträsura, the elephant was pushed back fourteen yards and fell, with Indra on its back."

            "content": "King Indra had first accepted Viçvarüpa as his priest and thereafter killed him. Reminding Indra of his heinous activities, Våträsura said, \"If one is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viñëu, and depends on Lord Viñëu in every respect, then victory, opulence and peace of mind are all inevitably available. Such a person has nothing for which to aspire in the three worlds. The Supreme Lord is so kind that He especially favors such a devotee by not giving him opulence that will hamper his devotional service. Therefore I wish to give up everything for the service of the Lord. I wish always to chant the glories of the Lord and engage in His service. Let me become unattached to my worldly family and make friendships with the devotees of the Lord. I do not desire to be promoted to the higher planetary systems, even to Dhruvaloka or Brahmaloka, nor do I desire an unconquerable position within this material world. I have no need for such things.\""
