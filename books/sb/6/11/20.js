    "translation": "O Indra, King of heaven, the thunderbolt you carry to kill me has been empowered by the prowess of Lord Viñëu and the strength of Dadhéci's austerities. Since you have come here to kill me in accordance with Lord Viñëu's order, there is no doubt that I shall be killed by the release of your thunderbolt. Lord Viñëu has sided with you. Therefore your victory, opulence and all good qualities are assured.",

Våträsura was eager to die with the stroke of the thunderbolt sent by Lord Viñëu so that he could immediately return home, back to Godhead. By hurling the thunderbolt, Indra would gain victory and enjoy the heavenly planets, remaining in the material world for repeated birth and death. Indra wanted to gain victory over Våträsura and thereby become happy, but that would not at all be happiness. The heavenly planets are just below Brahmaloka, but as stated by the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, äbrahma-bhuvanäl lokäù punar ävartino 'rjuna:  even if one achieves Brahmaloka, he must still fall to the lower planetary systems again and again. However, if one goes back to Godhead, he never returns to this material world. By killing Våträsura, Indra would not actually gain; he would remain in the material world. Våträsura, however, would go to the spiritual world. Therefore victory was destined for Våträsura, not for Indra."
