            "content": "This verse gives the sum and substance of devotional life. One must first become a servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord (däsänudäsa). Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu advised, and He also showed by His own example, that a living entity should always desire to be a servant of the servant of the servant of Kåñëa, the maintainer of the gopés (gopé-bhartuù pada-kamalayor däsa-däsänudäsaù ). This means that one must accept a spiritual master who comes in the disciplic succession and is a servant of the servant of the Lord. Under his direction, one must then engage one's three properties, namely his body, mind and words. The body should be engaged in physical activity under the order of the master, the mind should think of Kåñëa incessantly, and one's words should be engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord. If one is thus engaged in the loving service of the Lord, one's life is successful."
