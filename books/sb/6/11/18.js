    "translation": "But if in this battle you cut off my head with your thunderbolt and kill my soldiers, O Indra, O great hero, I shall take great pleasure in offering my body to other living entities [such as jackals and vultures]. I shall thus be relieved of my obligations to the reactions of my karma, and my fortune will be to receive the dust from the lotus feet of great devotees like Närada Muni.",

            "content": "\"I am the servant of the six Gosvämés, and the dust of their lotus feet provides my five kinds of food.\" A Vaiñëava always desires the dust of the lotus feet of previous äcäryas and Vaiñëavas. Våträsura was certain that he would be killed in the battle with Indra, because this was the desire of Lord Viñëu. He was prepared for death because he knew that after his death he was destined to return home, back to Godhead. This is a great destination, and it is achieved by the grace of a Vaiñëava. Chäòiyä vaiñëava-sevä nistära päyeche kebä: no one has ever gone back to Godhead without being favored by a Vaiñëava. In this verse, therefore, we find the words manasvinäà päda-rajaù prapatsye: \"I shall receive the dust of the lotus feet of great devotees.\" The word manasvinäm refers to great devotees who always think of Kåñëa. They are always peaceful, thinking of Kåñëa, and therefore they are called dhéra. The best example of such a devotee is Närada Muni. If one receives the dust of the lotus feet of a manasvé, a great devotee, he certainly returns home, back to Godhead."
