            "content": "When King Indra threw his club at Våträsura, Våträsura caught it in his left hand and retaliated by using it to strike the head of Indra's elephant. Thus Indra's attack was a disastrous failure. Indeed, Indra's elephant was injured and thrown back fourteen yards. Therefore even though Indra stood with the thunderbolt to hurl against Våträsura, he was doubtful, thinking that the thunderbolt might also fail. Våträsura, however, being a Vaiñëava, assured Indra that the thunderbolt would not fail, for Våträsura knew that it had been prepared in accordance with the instructions of Lord Viñëu. Although Indra had doubts because he could not understand that Lord Viñëu's order never fails, Våträsura understood Lord Viñëu's purpose. Våträsura was eager to be killed by the thunderbolt manufactured according to Lord Viñëu's instructions because he was sure that he would thus return home, back to Godhead. He was simply waiting for the opportunity of the thunderbolt's being released. In effect, therefore, Våträsura told Indra, \"If you want to kill me, since I am your enemy, take this opportunity. Kill me. You will gain victory, and I shall go back to Godhead. Your deed will be equally beneficial for both of us. Do it immediately.\""
