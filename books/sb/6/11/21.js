If one can fix his mind on the lotus feet of Kåñëa, Viñëu, Saìkarñaëa or any Viñëu mürti, his life will be successful. To be killed while fixing his mind at the lotus feet of Saìkarñaëa, Våträsura asked Indra to release his vajra, or thunderbolt. He was destined to be killed by the thunderbolt given by Lord Viñëu; there was no question of its being baffled. Therefore Våträsura requested Indra to release the thunderbolt immediately, and he prepared himself by fixing his mind at the lotus feet of Kåñëa. A devotee is always ready to give up his material body, which is described herein as grämya-päça, the rope of material attachment. The body is not at all good; it is simply a cause of bondage to the material world. Unfortunately, even though the body is destined for destruction, fools and rascals invest all their faith in the body and are never eager to return home, back to Godhead."
