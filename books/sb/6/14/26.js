King Citraketu responsibly desired to beget a child so that he and his forefathers might be delivered from the darkest regions. He was concerned with how to get piëòa, oblations, in the next life, not only for himself but also for his forefathers. Therefore he requested Aìgirä Åñi to favor him by doing something that could help him get a son."
