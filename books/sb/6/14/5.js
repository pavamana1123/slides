When one understands the futility of the materialistic way of life, one becomes advanced in knowledge, and therefore he situates himself in the vänaprastha order, unattached to family, wife and children. One should then further progress to the platform of sannyäsa, the actual renounced order, never to fall again and be afflicted by materialistic life. Even though one desires to be liberated, this does not mean he is liberated. Only rarely is someone liberated. Indeed, although many men take sannyäsa to become liberated, because of their imperfections they again become attached to women, material activities, social welfare work and so on."

Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu says, mäyävädé kåñëe aparädhé: one who thinks that everything is mäyä instead of thinking that everything is Kåñëa is called an aparädhé, or offender. Although the Mäyävädés, impersonalists, are offenders at the lotus feet of Kåñëa, they may nonetheless be counted among the siddhas, those who have realized the self. They may be considered nearer to spiritual perfection because at least they have realized what spiritual life is. If such a person becomes näräyaëa-paräyaëa, a devotee of Lord Näräyaëa, he is better than a jévan-mukta, one who is liberated or perfect. This requires higher intelligence."

Impersonalists generally undergo great endeavor for no tangible benefit, and therefore it is said that they are husking paddy that has no grain (sthüla-tuñävaghätinaù). The other class of jïänés, whose jïäna is mixed with bhakti, are also of two kinds—those who are devoted to the so-called false form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and those who understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1), the actual spiritual form. The Mäyävädé devotees worship Näräyaëa or Viñëu with the idea that Viñëu has accepted a form of mäyä and that the ultimate truth is actually impersonal. The pure devotee, however, never thinks that Viñëu has accepted a body of mäyä; instead, he knows perfectly well that the original Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person. Such a devotee is actually situated in knowledge. He never merges in the Brahman effulgence. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"
