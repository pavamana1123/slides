Thus the King was satisfied, thinking, \"Let there be a son. It does not matter if he is not very obedient.\" In Bengal there is a proverb that instead of having no maternal uncle, it is better to have a maternal uncle who is blind. The King accepted this philosophy, thinking that a disobedient son would be better than no son at all. The great sage Cäëakya Paëòita says:"

This attitude was represented in the history of King Citraketu."
