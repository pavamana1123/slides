He was born in a high family, he had a complete education, and he was wealthy and opulent. Nevertheless, in spite of being endowed with all these assets, he was full of anxiety because he did not have a son.",

Then he married a second, a third, a fourth and so on, but none of the wives could bear children. In spite of the material assets of janmaiçvarya-çruta-çré  birth in an aristocratic family with full opulence, wealth, education and beauty—he was very much aggrieved because in spite of having so many wives, he had no son. Certainly his grief was natural. Gåhastha life does not mean having a wife and no children. Cäëakya Paëòita says, putra-hénaà gåhaà çünyam: if a family man has no son, his home is no better than a desert. The King was certainly most unhappy that he could not get a son, and this is why he had married so many times. Kñatriyas especially are allowed to marry more than one wife, and this King did so. Nonetheless, he had no issue."
