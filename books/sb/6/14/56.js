Unless one has a son to offer oblations to the pitäs, or forefathers, one must suffer in Yamaräja's kingdom. King Citraketu was very much aggrieved. thinking that because his son was going away with Yamaräja he himself would again suffer. The subtle laws exist for the karmés; if one becomes a devotee, he has no more obligations to the laws of karma."
