They do not actually believe in the form of the Lord, but for the sake of worship they imagine some form to be God. Generally they imagine a form of Viñëu, a form of Çiva, and forms of Gaëeça, the sun-god and Durgä. This is called païcopäsanä. Dakña, however, wanted to worship not an imaginary form, but the supreme form of Lord Kåñëa."

Actually this is not knowledge but foolishness, and this verse is especially meant for such fools, whose knowledge has been stolen by illusion (mäyayäpahåta jïänäù ).

The lowest (adhama) think that there is no difference between God and the living entity except that the living entity is under designations whereas the Absolute Truth has no designations. In their opinion, as soon as the designations of the material body are dissolved, the jéva, the living entity, will mix with the Supreme. They give the argument of ghaöäkäça-paöäkäça, in which the body is compared to a pot with the sky within and the sky without. When the pot breaks, the sky inside becomes one with the sky outside, and so the impersonalists say that the living being becomes one with the Supreme. This is their argument, but Çréla Madhväcärya says that such an argument is put forward by the lowest class of men. Another class of men cannot ascertain what the actual form of the Supreme is, but they agree that there is a Supreme who controls the activities of the ordinary living being. Such philosophers are accepted as mediocre. The best, however. are those who understand the Supreme Lord (sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1). Pürëänandädi-guëakaà sarva jéva-vilakñaëam: His form is completely spiritual, full of bliss, and completely distinct from that of the conditioned soul or any other living entity. Uttamäs tu harià prähus täratamyena teñu ca: such philosophers are the best because they know that the Supreme Personality of Godhead reveals Himself differently to worshipers in various modes of material nature. They know that there are thirty-three million demigods just to convince the conditioned soul that there is a supreme power and to induce him to agree to worship one of these demigods so that by the association of devotees he may be able to understand that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As Lord Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä, mattaù parataraà nänyat kiïcid asti dhanaïjaya:  \"I am superior to everyone, even Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and the other demigods.\" These are the conclusions of the çästra, and one who accepts these conclusions should be considered a first-class philosopher. Such a philosopher knows that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord of the demigods (deva-deveçvaraà sütram änandaà präëa-vedinaù)."
