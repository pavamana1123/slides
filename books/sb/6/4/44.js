Why does the creation take place in such a way that the living entities are put into conditioned life to suffer the threefold miseries imposed upon them by the material nature? Here the Lord says to Dakña, \"You desire to benefit all living entities, and that is also My desire.\" The living entities who come in contact with the material world are meant to be corrected. All the living entities within this material world have revolted against the service of the Lord, and therefore they remain within this material world as ever conditioned, nitya-baddha, taking birth again and again. There is a chance, of course, of their being liberated, but nevertheless the conditioned souls, not taking advantage of this opportunity, continue in a life of sense enjoyment, and thus they are punished by birth and death again and again. This is the law of nature. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä :"

It is a bona fide movement intended to promote the welfare of all conditioned souls by trying to elevate everyone to the platform of Kåñëa consciousness. If one does not come to this platform, he must continue in material existence perpetually, sometimes in the upper planets and sometimes in the lower planets. As confirmed in Caitanya-caritämåta , kabhu svarge uöhäya, kabhu narake òubäya: the conditioned soul sometimes descends into nescience and sometimes gets some relief by being relatively freed from it. This is the life of the conditioned soul."

            "content": "Prajäpati Dakña is trying to benefit the conditioned souls by begetting them to give them a life with a chance for liberation. Liberation means surrender to Kåñëa. If one begets children with the purpose of training them to surrender to Kåñëa, fatherhood is very good. Similarly, when the spiritual master trains the conditioned souls to become Kåñëa conscious, his position is successful. If one gives the conditioned souls a chance to become Kåñëa conscious, all his activities are approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is extremely pleased, as stated here (préto 'ham). Following the examples of the previous äcäryas, all the members of the Kåñëa consciousness movement should try to benefit the conditioned souls by inducing them to become Kåñëa conscious and giving them all facilities to do so. Such activities constitute real welfare work. By such activities, a preacher or anyone who endeavors to spread Kåñëa consciousness is recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-gétä :"
