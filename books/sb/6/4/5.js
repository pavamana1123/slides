Although devotees undergo severe tapasya, however, they are vimanyavaù, sädhavaù, which means that they are never angry. They are always decorated with good qualities. Bhägavatam  states:"

            "content": "A sädhu, a devotee, is never angry. Actually the real feature of devotees who undergo tapasya, austerity, is forgiveness. Although a Vaiñëava has sufficient power in tapasya, he does not become angry when put into difficulty. If one undergoes tapasya but does not become a Vaiñëava, however, one does not develop good qualities. For example, Hiraëyakaçipu and Rävaëa also performed great austerities, but they did so to demonstrate their demoniac tendencies. Vaiñëavas must meet many opponents while preaching the glories of the Lord, but Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu recommends that they not become angry while preaching. Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu has given this formula: tåëäd api sunécena taror api sahiñëunä/ amäninä mänadena kértanéyaù sadä hariù . \"One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and should be ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.\" Those engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord should be humbler than grass and more tolerant than a tree; then they can preach the glories of the Lord without difficulty."
