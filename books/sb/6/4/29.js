The Supreme Lord is beyond the creation of this material world, for He is the source of the material qualities and creation. As the cause of all causes, He exists before the creation and after the creation. I wish to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.",

Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya was an impersonalist, but nevertheless he said, näräyaëaù paro 'vyaktät: Näräyaëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is not a person of the material world. We cannot assign Näräyaëa a material designation, as the foolish attempt to do when they speak of daridra-näräyaëa (poor Näräyaëa). Näräyaëa is always transcendental, beyond this material creation. How can He become daridra-näräyaëa? Poverty is found within this material world, but in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as poverty. Therefore the idea of daridra-näräyaëa is merely a concoction."

One cannot properly understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead merely by picking up expressions from a dictionary. In praying to the Lord, Dakña does not wish material names and forms to be the objects of his worship; rather, he wants to worship the Lord, who existed before the creation of material dictionaries and names. As confirmed in the Vedas, yato väco nivartante/ apräpya manasä saha: the name, form, attributes and paraphernalia of the Lord cannot be ascertained through a material dictionary. However, if one reaches the transcendental platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes well acquainted with everything, material and spiritual. This is confirmed in another Vedic mantra: tam eva viditväti måtyum eti. If one can somehow or other, by the grace of the Lord, understand the transcendental position of the Lord, one becomes eternal. This is further confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä :"
