Thus He exhibits transcendental forms and names with His different pastimes. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose form is eternal and full of knowledge and bliss, be merciful to me.",

The word anäma, which means \"having no name,\" indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material name. Simply by chanting the name of Näräyaëa to call his son, Ajämila attained salvation. This means that Näräyaëa is not an ordinary mundane name; it is nonmaterial. The word anäma, therefore, indicates that the names of the Supreme Lord do not belong to this material world. The vibration of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra is not a material sound, and similarly the form of the Lord and His appearance and activities are all nonmaterial. To show His causeless mercy to the devotees, as well as to the nondevotees, Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in this material world with names, forms and pastimes, all of which are transcendental. Unintelligent men who cannot understand this think that these names, forms and pastimes are material, and therefore they deny that He has a name or a form."

The Lord is sometimes called guëa-karma-näma because He is named according to His transcendental activities. For example, Kåñëa means \"all-attractive.\" This is the Lord's name because His transcendental qualities make Him very attractive. As a small boy He lifted Govardhana Hill, and in His childhood He killed many demons. Such activities are very attractive, and therefore He is sometimes called Giridhäré, Madhusüdana, Agha-niñüdana and so on. Because He acted as the son of Nanda Mahäräja, He is called Nanda-tanuja. These names already exist, but since nondevotees cannot understand the names of the Lord, He is sometimes called anäma, or nameless. This means that He has no material names. All His activities are spiritual, and therefore He has spiritual names."
