    "translation": "There are two parties—namely, the theists and the atheists. The theist, who accepts the Supersoul, finds the spiritual cause through mystic yoga. The Säìkhyite, however, who merely analyzes the material elements, comes to a conclusion of impersonalism and does not accept a supreme cause—whether Bhagavän, Paramätmä or even Brahman. Instead, he is preoccupied with the superfluous, external activities of material nature. Ultimately, however, both parties demonstrate the Absolute Truth because although they offer opposing statements, their object is the same ultimate cause. They are both approaching the same Supreme Brahman, to whom I offer my respectful obeisances.",

Therefore the word form is the common factor, although some accept it (asti or astika) whereas others try to negate it (nästi or nästika). Since the devotee considers the word \"form\" (äkära) the common factor for both, he offers his respectful obeisances to the form, although others may go on arguing about whether the Absolute has a form or not."

Yoga means bhakti-yoga because yogés also accept the existence of the all-pervading Supreme Soul and try to see that Supreme Soul within their hearts. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  the Absolute Truth is one, but some accept Him as impersonal Brahman, some as the Supersoul existing everywhere, and some as Bhagavän, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The central point is the Absolute Truth."

            "content": "Although the impersonalists and personalists fight with one another, they focus upon the same Parabrahman, the same Absolute Truth. In the yoga-çästras, Kåñëa is described as follows: kåñëaà piçaìgämbaram ambujekñaëaà catur-bhujaà çaìkha-gadädy-udäyudham. Thus the pleasing appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's bodily features, His limbs and His dress are described. The säìkhya-çästra, however, denies the existence of the Lord's transcendental form. The säìkhya-çästra says that the Supreme Absolute Truth has no hands, no legs and no name: hy anäma-rüpa-guëa-päëi-pädam acakñur açrotram ekam advitéyam api näma-rüpädikaà nästi. The Vedic mantras say, apäëi-pädo javano grahétä: the Supreme Lord has no legs and hands, but He can accept whatever is offered to Him. Actually such statements accept that the Supreme has hands and legs, but deny that He has material hands and legs. This is why the Absolute is called apräkåta. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has a sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1), a form of eternity, knowledge and bliss, not a material form. The Säìkhyites, or jïänés, deny the material form, and the devotees also know very well that the Absolute Truth, Bhagavän, has no material form."

He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes.\" The conception of the Absolute without hands and legs and the conception of the Absolute with hands and legs are apparently contradictory, but they both coincide with the same truth about the Supreme Absolute Person. Therefore the word vastu-niñöhayoù, which is used herein, indicates that both the yogés and Säìkhyites have faith in the reality, but are arguing about it from the different viewpoints of material and spiritual identities. Parabrahman, or båhat, is the common point. The Säìkhyites and yogés are both situated in that same Brahman, but they differ because of different angles of vision."

            "content": "The directions given by the bhakti-çästra point one in the perfect direction because the Supreme Personality of Godhead says in Bhagavad-gétä, bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti:  \"Only by devotional service am I to be known.\" The bhaktas know that the Supreme Person has no material form, whereas the jïänés simply deny the material form. One should therefore take shelter of the bhakti-märga, the path of devotion; then everything will be clear. Jïänés concentrate on the viräö-rüpa, the gigantic universal form of the Lord. This is a good system in the beginning for those who are extremely materialistic, but there is no need to think continuously of the viräö-rüpa. When Arjuna was shown the viräö-rüpa of Kåñëa, he saw it, but he did not want to see it perpetually. He therefore requested the Lord to return to His original form as two-armed Kåñëa. In conclusion, learned scholars find no contradictions in the devotees' concentration upon the spiritual form of the Lord (éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù (BS 5.1)). In this regard, Çréla Madhväcärya says that less intelligent nondevotees think that their conclusion is the ultimate, but because devotees are completely learned, they can understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal."
