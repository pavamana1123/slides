    "translation": "The path of goodness traversed by your father, grandfather and great-grandfathers is that of maintaining the subjects [prajäs], including the men, animals and trees. That is the path you should follow. Unnecessary anger is contrary to your duty. Therefore I request you to control your anger.",

Such a royal family has a prestigious position because it maintains the citizens, or prajäs. The word prajä refers to one who has taken birth within the jurisdiction of the government. The exalted royal families were conscious that all living beings, whether human, animal or lower than animal, should be given protection. The modern democratic system cannot be exalted in this way because the leaders elected strive only for power and have no sense of responsibility. In a monarchy, a king with a prestigious position follows the great deeds of his forefathers. Thus Soma, the king of the moon, here reminds the Pracetäs about the glories of their father, grandfather and great-grandfathers."
