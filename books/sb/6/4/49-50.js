Because of these austerities, the great Lord Brahmä was able to create nine personalities, including you, to help him in the functions of creation.",

The more we engage in austerities, the more we become powerful by the grace of the Lord. Therefore Åñabhadeva advised His sons, tapo divyaà putrakä yena sattvaà çuddhyed: \"One should engage in penance and austerity to attain the divine position of devotional service. By such activity, one's heart is purified.\"  In our material existence we are impure, and therefore we cannot do anything wonderful, but if we purify our existence by tapasya, we can do wonderful things by the grace of the Lord. Therefore tapasya is very important, as stressed in this verse."
