Präcénabarhi understood Närada properly and then left the kingdom to perform austerities in the forest. His ten sons, however, were performing austerities within the water, and therefore there was no king to see to the management of the world. When the ten sons, the Pracetäs, came out of the water, they saw that the earth was overrun with trees."

            "content": "When the government neglects agriculture, which is necessary for the production of food, the land becomes covered with unnecessary trees. Of course, many trees are useful because they produce fruits and flowers, but many other trees are unnecessary. They could be used as fuel and the land cleared and used for agriculture. When the government is negligent, less grain is produced. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , kåñi-go-rakñya-väëijyaà vaiçya-karma svabhäva jam: the proper engagements for vaiçyas, according to their nature, are to farm and to protect cows. The duty of the government and the kñatriyas is to see that the members of the third class, the vaiçyas, who are neither brähmaëas nor kñatriyas, are thus properly engaged. Kñatriyas are meant to protect human beings, whereas vaiçyas are meant to protect useful animals, especially cows."
