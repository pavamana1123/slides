From Him, Brahmä is created, and Brahmä takes charge of the affairs of the universe. The universal affairs of the material creation depend upon the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is therefore the cause of the material creation. The entire cosmic manifestation is described herein as guëa-vigrahaù, the form of the Lord's qualities. From the cosmic universal form, the first creation is Lord Brahmä, who is the cause of all living entities. In this regard, Çréla Madhväcärya describes the unlimited attributes of the Lord:"
