Devotees accept that the ultimate cause is Kåñëa because this conclusion is supported by all Vedic literature and also by Kåñëa Himself, who says, ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù:  \"I am the source of everything.\" Devotees have no problem understanding the ultimate cause of everything, but nondevotees must face many opposing elements because everyone who wants to be a prominent philosopher invents his own way. In India there are many parties of philosophers, such as the dvaita-vädés, advaita-vädés, vaiçeñikas, mémäàsakas, Mäyävädés and svabhäva-vädés, and each of them opposes the others. Similarly, in the Western countries there are also many philosophers with different views of creation, life, maintenance and annihilation. Thus it is undoubtedly a fact that there are countless philosophers throughout the world, each of them contradicting the others."

Because they are ignorant and bewildered concerning the soul and its activities, even though some of them have a vague idea of the soul, many controversies arise, and the philosophical speculators can never reach a conclusion.
