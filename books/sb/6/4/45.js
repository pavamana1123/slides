    "translation": "Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva, the Manus, all the other demigods in the higher planetary systems, and you prajäpatis, who are increasing the population, are working for the benefit of all living entities. Thus you expansions of My marginal energy are incarnations of My various qualities.",

The expansions of His personal self, or viñëu-tattva, are called sväàça expansions, whereas the living entities, who are not viñëu-tattva but jéva-tattva, are called vibhinnäàça, separated expansions. Although Prajäpati Dakña is not on the same level as Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, he is compared to them because he engages in the service of the Lord. In the service of the Personality of Godhead, it is not that Lord Brahmä is considered very great while an ordinary human being trying to preach the glories of the Lord is considered very low. There are no such distinctions. Regardless of whether materially high or materially low, anyone engaged in the service of the Lord is spiritually very dear to Him. In this regard, Çréla Madhväcärya gives this quotation from the Tantra-nirëaya:"
