Yamaräja specifically advises his servants to bring these persons to him for punishment and not to bring the devotees, who always lick the honey at the lotus feet of the Lord, who are equal to everyone, and who try to preach Kåñëa consciousness because of sympathy for all living entities. Devotees are not liable to punishment by Yamaräja, but persons who have no information of Kåñëa consciousness cannot be protected by their material life of so-called family enjoyment.
