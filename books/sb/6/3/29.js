Varëäçrama-dharma easily brings one nearer to Lord Viñëu, who is the only true objective in human society. Na te viduù svärtha-gatià hi viñëum:  unfortunately, however, people do not know that their self-interest is to return home, back to Godhead, or to approach Lord Viñëu. Duräçayä ye bahir-artha-mäninaù: instead, they are simply bewildered. Every human being is expected to perform duties meant for approaching Lord Viñëu. Therefore Yamaräja advises the Yamadütas to bring him those persons who have forgotten their duties toward Viñëu (akåta-viñëu-kåtyän). One who does not chant the holy name of Viñëu (Kåñëa), who does not bow down to the Deity of Viñëu, and who does not remember the lotus feet of Viñëu is punishable by Yamaräja. In summary, all avaiñëavas, persons unconcerned with Lord Viñëu, are punishable by Yamaräja."
