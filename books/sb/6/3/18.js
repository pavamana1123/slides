    "translation": "The order carriers of Lord Viñëu, who are worshiped even by the demigods, possess wonderful bodily features exactly like those of Viñëu and are very rarely seen. The Viñëudütas protect the devotees of the Lord from the hands of enemies, from envious persons and even from my jurisdiction, as well as from natural disturbances.",

            "content": "Yamaräja has specifically described the qualities of the Viñëudütas to convince his own servants not to be envious of them. Yamaräja warned the Yamadütas that the Viñëudütas are worshiped with respectful obeisances by the demigods and are always very alert to protect the devotees of the Lord from the hands of enemies, from natural disturbances and from all dangerous conditions in this material world. Sometimes the members of the Kåñëa Consciousness Society are afraid of the impending danger of world war and ask what would happen to them if a war should occur. In all kinds of danger, they should be confident of their protection by the Viñëudütas or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati  in this material world there are dangers at every step, but they are not meant for devotees who have fully surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord. The pure devotees of Lord Viñëu may rest assured of the Lord's protection, and as long as they are in this material world they should fully engage in devotional service by preaching the cult of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and Lord Kåñëa, namely the Hare Kåñëa movement of Kåñëa consciousness."
