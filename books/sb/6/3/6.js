    "translation": "The Yamadütas continued: Since there are many different karmés, or workers, there may be different judges or rulers to give them justice, but just as one central emperor controls different departmental rulers, there must be one supreme controller to guide all the judges.",

            "content": "In governmental management there may be departmental officials to give justice to different persons, but the law must be one, and that central law must control everyone. The Yamadütas could not imagine that two judges would give two different verdicts in the same case, and therefore they wanted to know who the central judge is. The Yamadütas were certain that Ajämila was a most sinful man, but although Yamaräja wanted to punish him, the Viñëudütas excused him. This was a puzzling situation that the Yamadütas wanted Yamaräja to clarify."
