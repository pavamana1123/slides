    "translation": "Because they are bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Yäjïavalkya and Jaimini and other compilers of the religious scriptures cannot know the secret, confidential religious system of the twelve mahäjanas. They cannot understand the transcendental value of performing devotional service or chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra. Because their minds are attracted to the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas—especially the Yajur Veda, Säma Veda and Åg Veda—their intelligence has become dull. Thus they are busy collecting the ingredients for ritualistic ceremonies that yield only temporary benefits, such as elevation to Svargaloka for material happiness. They are not attracted to the saìkértana movement; instead, they are interested in dharma, artha, käma and mokña.",

            "content": "Since one may easily achieve the highest success by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one may ask why there are so many Vedic ritualistic ceremonies and why people are attracted to them. This verse answers that question. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: the real purpose of studying the Vedas is to approach the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa. Unfortunately, unintelligent people bewildered by the grandeur of Vedic yajïas want to see gorgeous sacrifices performed. They want Vedic mantras chanted and huge amounts of money spent for such ceremonies. Sometimes we have to observe the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies to please such unintelligent men. Recently, when we established a large Kåñëa-Balaräma temple in Våndävana, we were obliged to have Vedic ceremonies enacted by brähmaëas because the inhabitants of Våndävana, especially the smärta-brähmaëas, would not accept Europeans and Americans as bona fide brähmaëas. Thus we had to engage brähmaëas to perform costly yajïas. In spite of these yajïas, the members of our Society performed saìkértana loudly with mådaìgas, and I considered the saìkértana more important than the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. Both the ceremonies and the saìkértana were going on simultaneously. The ceremonies were meant for persons interested in Vedic rituals for elevation to heavenly planets (jaòé-kåta-matir madhu-puñpitäyäm), whereas the saìkértana was meant for pure devotees interested in pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We would simply have performed saìkértana, but then the inhabitants of Våndävana would not have taken the installation ceremony seriously. As explained here, the Vedic performances are meant for those whose intelligence has been dulled by the flowery language of the Vedas, which describe fruitive activities intended to elevate one to the higher planets."

            "content": "Especially in this age of Kali, saìkértana alone is sufficient. If the members of our temples in the different parts of the world simply continue saìkértana before the Deity, especially before Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, they will remain perfect. There is no need of any other performances. Nevertheless, to keep oneself clean in habits and mind, Deity worship and other regulative principles are required. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé says that although saìkértana is sufficient for the perfection of life, the arcanä, or worship of the Deity in the temple, must continue in order that the devotees may stay clean and pure. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura therefore recommended that one follow both processes simultaneously. We strictly follow his principle of performing Deity worship and saìkértana along parallel lines. This we should continue."
