    "translation": "[Then Yamaräja, considering himself and his servants to be offenders, spoke as follows, begging pardon from the Lord.] O my Lord, my servants have surely committed a great offense by arresting a Vaiñëava such as Ajämila. O Näräyaëa, O supreme and oldest person, please forgive us. Because of our ignorance, we failed to recognize Ajämila as a servant of Your Lordship, and thus we have certainly committed a great offense. Therefore with folded hands we beg Your pardon. My Lord, since You are supremely merciful and are always full of good qualities, please pardon us. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You.",

If the servant of an establishment makes a mistake, the establishment takes responsibility for it. Although Yamaräja is above offenses, his servants, practically with his permission, went to arrest Ajämila, which was a great offense. The nyäya-çästra confirms, bhåtyäparädhe svämino daëòaù: if a servant makes a mistake, the master is punishable because he is responsible for the offense. Taking this seriously, Yamaräja, along with his servants, prayed with folded hands to be excused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa."
