    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is self-sufficient and fully independent. He is the master of everyone and everything, including the illusory energy. He has His form, qualities and features; and similarly His order carriers, the Vaiñëavas, who are very beautiful, possess bodily features, transcendental qualities and a transcendental nature almost like His. They always wander within this world with full independence.",

Yamaräja therefore stated that the Viñëudütas resemble the Supreme Personality of Godhead in their bodily features, transcendental qualities and nature. In other words, the Viñëudütas, or Vaiñëavas, are almost as qualified as the Supreme Lord. Yamaräja informed the Yamadütas that the Viñëudütas are no less powerful than Lord Viñëu. Since Viñëu is above Yamaräja, the Viñëudütas are above the Yamadütas. Persons protected by the Viñëudütas, therefore, cannot be touched by the Yamadütas."
