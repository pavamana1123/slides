They did not know, however, that the Vedic literature contains ritualistic ceremonies that are not transcendental, but are meant to keep peace and order among materialistic persons in the material world. Real religious principles are nistraiguëya, above the three modes of material nature, or transcendental. The Yamadütas did not know these transcendental religious principles, and therefore when prevented from arresting Ajämila they were surprised. Materialistic persons who attach all their faith to the Vedic rituals are described in Bhagavad-gétä ). Those who do not know this principle but who simply attach their faith to the Vedic rituals are called veda-väda-ratäù."

Sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja:  one should give up all other duties and surrender unto the lotus feet of Kåñëa. That is the real religious principle everyone should follow. Even though one follows Vedic scriptures, one may not know this transcendental principle, for it is not known to everyone. To say nothing of human beings, even the demigods in the upper planetary systems are unaware of it. This transcendental religious principle must be understood from the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly or from His special representative, as stated in the next verses."
