    "translation": "Just as the driver of a bullock cart ties ropes through the nostrils of his bulls to control them, the Supreme Personality of Godhead binds all men through the ropes of His words in the Vedas, which set forth the names and activities of the distinct orders of human society [brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra]. In fear, the members of these orders all worship the Supreme Lord by offering Him presentations according to their respective activities.",

One may be a human being, a demigod or an animal, tree or plant, but everything is controlled by the laws of nature, and behind this natural control is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed by Bhagavad-gétä , wherein Kåñëa says, mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram: \"The material nature is working under My direction and producing all moving and nonmoving beings.\" Thus Kåñëa is behind the natural machine, which works under His control."

A human being is expected to follow the rules and regulations of varëa and äçrama; otherwise he cannot escape punishment by Yamaräja. The point is that every human being is expected to elevate himself to the position of a brähmaëa, the most intelligent man, and then one must transcend that position to become a Vaiñëava. This is the perfection of life. The brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra can elevate themselves by worshiping the Lord according to their activities (sve sve karmaëy abhirataù saàsiddhià labhate naraù). The divisions of varëa and äçrama are necessary to insure the proper execution of duties and peaceful existence for everyone, but everyone is directed to worship the Supreme Lord, who is all-pervading (yena sarvam idaà tatam). The Supreme Lord exists vertically and horizontally (otaà protam), and therefore if one follows the Vedic injunctions by worshiping the Supreme Lord according to one's ability, his life will be perfect. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

One can please the Lord under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. and if one does so his life is perfect. The Supreme Lord is worshipable. and everyone worships Him directly or indirectly. Those who worship Him directly get the results of liberation quickly, whereas the liberation of those who serve Him indirectly is delayed."

The väk, or Vedic injunctions, give directions for all these divisions. Everyone is expected to offer obeisances to the Supreme Lord and perform duties as indicated in the Vedas."
