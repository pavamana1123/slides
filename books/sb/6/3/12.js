    "translation": "Yamaräja said: My dear servants, you have accepted me as the Supreme, but factually I am not. Above me, and above all the other demigods, including Indra and Candra, is the one supreme master and controller. The partial manifestations of His personality are Brahmä, Viñëu and Çiva, who are in charge of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this universe. He is like the two threads that form the length and breadth of a woven cloth. The entire world is controlled by Him just as a bull is controlled by a rope in its nose.",

To eradicate their doubts, Yamaräja immediately replied, \"Yes, there is one supreme controller above everything.\" Yamaräja is in charge of some of the moving living entities, namely the human beings, but the animals, who also move, are not under his control. Only human beings have consciousness of right and wrong, and among them only those who perform sinful activities come under the control of Yamaräja. Therefore although Yamaräja is a controller, he is only a departmental controller of a few living entities. There are other demigods who control many other departments, but above them all is one supreme controller, Kåñëa. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù (BS 5.1): the supreme controller is Kåñëa. Others, who control their own departments in the affairs of the universe, are insignificant in comparison to Kåñëa, the supreme controller. Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä , mattaù parataraà nänyat kiïcid asti dhanaïjaya: \"My dear Dhanaïjaya [Arjuna], no one is superior to Me.\" Therefore Yamaräja immediately cleared away the doubts of his assistants, the Yamadütas, by confirming that there is a supreme controller above all others."
