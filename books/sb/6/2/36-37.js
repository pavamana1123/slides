    "translation": "Because of identifying oneself with the body, one is subjected to desires for sense gratification, and thus one engages in many different types of pious and impious action. This is what constitutes material bondage. Now I shall disentangle myself from my material bondage, which has been caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead's illusory energy in the form of a woman. Being a most fallen soul, I was victimized by the illusory energy and have become like a dancing dog led around by a woman's hand. Now I shall give up all lusty desires and free myself from this illusion. I shall become a merciful, well-wishing friend to all living entities and always absorb myself in Kåñëa consciousness.",

            "content": "This should be the standard of determination for all Kåñëa conscious persons. A Kåñëa conscious person should free himself from the clutches of mäyä, and he should also be compassionate to all others suffering in those clutches. The activities of the Kåñëa consciousness movement are meant not only for oneself but for others also. This is the perfection of Kåñëa consciousness. One who is interested in his own salvation is not as advanced in Kåñëa consciousness as one who feels compassion for others and who therefore propagates the Kåñëa consciousness movement. Such an advanced devotee will never fall down, for Kåñëa will give him special protection. That is the sum and substance of the Kåñëa consciousness movement. Everyone is like a play toy in the hands of the illusory energy and is acting as she moves him. One should come to Kåñëa consciousness to release oneself and also to release others."
