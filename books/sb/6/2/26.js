            "content": "The men of the higher classes—the brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas—do not beget children in the wombs of lower-class women. Therefore the custom in Vedic society is to examine the horoscopes of a girl and boy being considered for marriage to see whether their combination is suitable. Vedic astrology reveals whether one has been born in the vipra-varëa, kñatriya-varëa, vaiçya-varëa or çüdra-varëa, according to the three qualities of material nature. This must be examined because a marriage between a boy of the vipra-varëa and a girl of the çüdra-varëa is incompatible; married life would be miserable for both husband and wife. Consequently a boy should marry a girl of the same category. Of course, this is trai-guëya, a material calculation according to the Vedas, but if the boy and girl are devotees there need be no such considerations. A devotee is transcendental, and therefore in a marriage between devotees, the boy and girl form a very happy combination."
