    "translation": "The Viñëudütas continued: Even previously, while eating and at other times, this Ajämila would call his son, saying, \"My dear Näräyaëa, please come here.\" Although calling the name of his son, he nevertheless uttered the four syllables nä-rä-ya-ëa. Simply by chanting the name of Näräyaëa in this way, he sufficiently atoned for the sinful reactions of millions of lives.",

To chant the holy name of the Lord just to counteract one's sinful activities, or to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name, is offensive (nämno baläd yasya hi päpa-buddhiù). But although Ajämila engaged in sinful activities, he never chanted the holy name of Näräyaëa to counteract them; he simply chanted the name Näräyaëa to call his son. Therefore his chanting was effective. Because of chanting the holy name of Näräyaëa in this way, he had already vanquished the accumulated sinful reactions of many, many lives. In the beginning he was pure, but although he later committed many sinful acts, he was offenseless because he did not chant the holy name of Näräyaëa to counteract them. One who always chants the holy name of the Lord without offenses is always pure. As confirmed in this verse Ajämila was already sinless, and because he chanted the name of Näräyaëa he remained sinless. It did not matter that he was calling his son; the name itself was effective."
