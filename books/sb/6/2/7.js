    "translation": "Ajämila has already atoned for all his sinful actions. Indeed, he has atoned not only for sins performed in one life but for those performed in millions of lives, for in a helpless condition he chanted the holy name of Näräyaëa. Even though he did not chant purely, he chanted without offense, and therefore he is now pure and eligible for liberation.",

Since he was extremely sinful throughout his life, they thought he should be taken to Yamaräja and did not know that he had become free from the reactions of all his sins. The Viñëudütas therefore instructed that because he had chanted the four syllables of the name Näräyaëa at the time of his death, he was freed from all sinful reactions.
