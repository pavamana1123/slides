The Viñëudütas feared that if such irreligious acts were allowed, the management of human society would be spoiled. In modern times, the Kåñëa consciousness movement is trying to introduce the right principles of management for human society, but unfortunately the governments of Kali-yuga do not properly support the Hare Kåñëa movement because they do not appreciate its valuable service. The Hare Kåñëa movement is the right movement for ameliorating the fallen condition of human society, and therefore governments and public leaders in every part of the world should support this movement to completely rectify humanity's sinful condition."
