    "translation": "The chanting of the holy name of Lord Viñëu is the best process of atonement for a thief of gold or other valuables, for a drunkard, for one who betrays a friend or relative, for one who kills a brähmaëa, or for one who indulges in sex with the wife of his guru or another superior. It is also the best method of atonement for one who murders women, the king or his father, for one who slaughters cows, and for all other sinful men. Simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Viñëu, such sinful persons may attract the attention of the Supreme Lord, who therefore considers, \"Because this man has chanted My holy name, My duty is to give him protection.\"",
