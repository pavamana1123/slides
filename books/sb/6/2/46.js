    "translation": "Therefore one who desires freedom from material bondage should adopt the process of chanting and glorifying the name, fame, form and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at whose feet all the holy places stand. One cannot derive the proper benefit from other methods, such as pious atonement, speculative knowledge and meditation in mystic yoga, because even after following such methods one takes to fruitive activities again, unable to control his mind, which is contaminated by the base qualities of nature, namely passion and ignorance.",

Many so-called svämés and yogés give up material activities as false (jagan mithyä), but after some time they nevertheless resume material activities by opening hospitals and schools or performing other activities for the benefit of the public. Sometimes they participate in politics, although still falsely declaring themselves sannyäsés, members of the renounced order. The perfect conclusion, however, is that if one actually desires to get out of the material world, he must take to devotional service, which begins with çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù: :"

As he advances in devotional service, all his doubts are completely eradicated (bhidyate hådaya-granthiç chidyante sarva-saàçayäù). Thus the knot of his desire for fruitive activities is cut to pieces."
