Yamaräja is the officer appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to judge religious and irreligious principles and to punish people who are irreligious. However, if completely sinless people are punished, the entire assembly of Yamaräja is contaminated. This principle applies not only in the assembly of Yamaräja, but throughout human society also."

            "content": "In human society, properly maintaining religious principles is the duty of the king's court or the government. Unfortunately, in this yuga, Kali-yuga, the religious principles are tampered with, and the government cannot properly judge who is to be punished and who is not. It is said that in the Kali-yuga if one cannot spend money in court, one cannot get justice. Indeed, in courts of justice it is often found that magistrates are bribed for favorable judgments. Sometimes religious men who preach the Kåñëa consciousness movement for the benefit of the entire populace are arrested and harassed by the police and courts. The Viñëudütas, who are Vaiñëavas, lamented for these very regrettable facts. Because of their spiritual compassion for all the fallen souls, Vaiñëavas go out to preach according to the standard method of all religious principles, but unfortunately, because of the influence of Kali-yuga, Vaiñëavas who have dedicated their lives to preaching the glories of the Lord are sometimes harassed and punished by courts on false charges of disturbing the peace."
