    "translation": "Having been released from the nooses of Yamaräja's servants, the brähmaëa Ajämila, now free from fear, came to his senses and immediately offered obeisances to the Viñëudütas by bowing his head at their lotus feet. He was extremely pleased by their presence, for he had seen them save his life from the hands of the servants of Yamaräja.",

Lord Kåñëa is very eager for all the conditioned souls rotting in this material world to surrender to Him and be saved from material pangs in this life and punishment in hellish conditions after death. A Vaiñëava therefore tries to bring conditioned souls to their senses. Those who are fortunate like Ajämila are saved by the Viñëudütas, or Vaiñëavas, and thus they return back home, back to Godhead."
