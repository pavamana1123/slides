There is no distinction between the form of the Lord and the Lord Himself. Therefore bhakti-yoga is the most easy system of yoga. Yogés try to concentrate their minds upon the form of the Supersoul, Viñëu, within the heart, but this same objective is easily achieved when one's mind is absorbed in the Deity worshiped in the temple. In every temple there is a transcendental form of the Lord, and one may easily think of this form. By seeing the Lord during ärati, by offering bhoga and by constantly thinking of the form of the Deity, one becomes a first-class yogé. This is the best process of yoga, as confirmed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Bhagavad-gétä :"
