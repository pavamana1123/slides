Our Kåñëa consciousness movement now has centers in Våndävana and Navadvépa so that those who want to live a retired life, whether they be devotees or not, can go there and with determination give up the bodily concept of life. One is welcome to live in those holy places for the rest of his life in order to achieve the highest success by the very simple method of chanting the holy name of the Lord and taking prasäda. Thus one may return home, back to Godhead. We do not have a center in Hardwar, but Våndävana and Çrédhäma Mäyäpur are better for devotees than any other places. The Caitanya Candrodaya temple offers one a good opportunity to associate with devotees. Let us all take advantage of this opportunity."
