    "translation": "Ajämila was a brähmaëa who because of bad association had given up all brahminical culture and religious principles. Becoming most fallen, he stole, drank and performed other abominable acts. He even kept a prostitute. Thus he was destined to be carried away to hell by the order carriers of Yamaräja, but he was immediately rescued simply by a glimpse of the chanting of the holy name Näräyaëa.",
