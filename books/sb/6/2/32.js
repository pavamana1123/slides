            "content": "\"Association with devotees is recommended by all the çästras because by even a moment of such association one can receive the seed for all perfection.\" In the beginning of his life Ajämila was certainly very pure, and he associated with devotees and brähmaëas; because of that pious activity, even though he was fallen, he was inspired to name his son Näräyaëa. Certainly this was due to good counsel given from within by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä  by the mercy of the guru and Kåñëa, one receives the seed of bhakti. This association saves a devotee from the greatest fear. In our Kåñëa consciousness movement we therefore change a devotee's name to a form that reminds him of Viñëu. If at the time of death the devotee can remember his own name, such as Kåñëadäsa or Govinda däsa, he can be saved from the greatest danger. Therefore the change of names at the time of initiation is essential. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is so meticulous that it gives one a good opportunity to remember Kåñëa somehow or other."
