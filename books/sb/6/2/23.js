Because Ajämila was now free from all sinful reactions, his lifetime was extended, even though he was to have died immediately. When the Viñëudütas saw Ajämila trying to say something to them, they disappeared to give him a chance to glorify the Supreme Lord. Since all his sinful reactions had been vanquished, he was now prepared to glorify the Lord. Indeed, one cannot glorify the Lord unless one is completely free from all sinful activities. This is confirmed by Kåñëa Himself in Bhagavad-gétä :"

To increase his eagerness to glorify the Lord, they disappeared so that he would feel separation in their absence. In the mode of separation, glorification of the Lord is very intense."
