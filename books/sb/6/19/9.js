    "translation": "If one desires all opulences, his duty is to daily worship Lord Viñëu with His wife, Lakñmé. With great devotion one should worship Him according to the above-mentioned process. Lord Viñëu and the goddess of fortune are an immensely powerful combination. They are the bestowers of all benedictions and the sources of all good fortune. Therefore the duty of everyone is to worship Lakñmé-Näräyaëa.",

However, because nondevotees do not realize that Lord Viñëu stays with His eternal consort, Lakñmé, within the hearts of all living entities, they are not endowed with the opulence of Lord Viñëu. Unscrupulous men sometimes address a poor man as daridra-näräyaëa, or \"poor Näräyaëa.\" This is most unscientific. Lord Viñëu and Lakñmé are always situated in everyone's heart, but this does not mean that everyone is Näräyaëa, especially not those in poverty. This is a most abominable term to use in connection with Näräyaëa. Näräyaëa never becomes poor, and therefore He can never be called daridra-näräyaëa. Näräyaëa is certainly situated in everyone's heart, but He is neither poor nor rich. Only unscrupulous persons who do not know the opulence of Näräyaëa try to afflict Him with poverty."
