Although He is full in Himself, He nonetheless wants all the living entities to surrender unto Him so that they may engage in His service. Thus He becomes satisfied. Although He is full in Himself, He nonetheless becomes pleased when His devotee offers Him patraà puñpaà phalaà toyam , where the Lord tells Arjuna, nimitta-mätraà bhava savyasäcin: \"O Arjuna, merely be an instrument in the fight.\" Lord Kåñëa had the competence to win the Battle of Kurukñetra, but nonetheless He induced His devotee Arjuna to fight and become the cause of victory. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu was quite competent enough to spread His name and mission all over the world, but still He depended upon His devotee to do this work. Considering all these points, the most important aspect of the Supreme Lord's self-sufficiency is that He depends on His devotees. This is called His causeless mercy. The devotee who has perceived this causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by realization can understand the master and the servant."
