    "translation": "If an unmarried girl observes this vrata, she will be able to get a very good husband. If a woman who is avérä—who has no husband or son—executes this ritualistic ceremony, she can be promoted to the spiritual world. A woman whose children have died after birth can get a child with a long duration of life and also become very fortunate in possessing wealth. If a woman is unfortunate she will become fortunate, and if ugly she will become beautiful. By observing this vrata, a diseased man can gain relief from his disease and have an able body with which to work. If one recites this narration while offering oblations to the pitäs and demigods, especially during the çräddha ceremony, the demigods and inhabitants of Pitåloka will be extremely pleased with him and bestow upon him the fulfillment of all desires. After one performs this ritualistic ceremony, Lord Viñëu and His wife, mother Lakñmé, the goddess of fortune, are very pleased with him. O King Parékñit, now I have completely described how Diti performed this ceremony and had good children—the Maruts—and a happy life. I have tried to explain this to you as elaborately as possible.",
