    "translation": "[After profusely offering obeisances unto Lord Viñëu, the devotee should offer respectful obeisances unto mother Lakñmé, the goddess of fortune, and pray as follows.] O wife of Lord Viñëu, O internal energy of Lord Viñëu, you are as good as Lord Viñëu Himself, for you have all of His qualities and opulences. O goddess of fortune, please be kind to me. O mother of the entire world, I offer my respectful obeisances unto you.",

            "content": "The Lord has multifarious potencies (paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate ). Since mother Lakñmé, the goddess of fortune, is the Lord's very precious potency, she is addressed here as mahä-mäye. The word mäyä means çakti. Lord Viñëu, the Supreme, cannot exhibit His power everywhere without His principal energy. It is said, çakti çaktimän abheda: the power and the powerful are identical. Therefore mother Lakñmé, the goddess of fortune, is the constant companion of Lord Viñëu; they remain together constantly. One cannot keep Lakñmé in one's home without Lord Viñëu. To think that one can do so is very dangerous. To keep Lakñmé, or the riches of the Lord, without the service of the Lord is always dangerous, for then Lakñmé becomes the illusory energy. With Lord Viñëu, however, Lakñmé is the spiritual energy."
