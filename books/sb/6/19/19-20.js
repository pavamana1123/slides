    "translation": "One should accept this viñëu-vrata, which is a vow in devotional service, and should not deviate from its execution to engage in anything else. By offering the remnants of prasäda, flower garlands, sandalwood pulp and ornaments, one should daily worship the brähmaëas and worship women who peacefully live with their husbands and children. Every day the wife must continue following the regulative principles to worship Lord Viñëu with great devotion. Thereafter, Lord Viñëu should be laid in His bed, and then one should take prasäda. In this way, husband and wife will be purified and will have all their desires fulfilled.",
