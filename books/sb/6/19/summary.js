During the first day of the bright fortnight of the moon in the month of Agrahäyaëa (November-December), every woman, following in the footsteps of Diti and following the instructions of her own husband, should begin this puàsavana-vrata. In the morning, after washing her teeth, bathing and thus becoming purified, she should hear about the birth mystery of the Maruts. Then, covering her body with a white dress and being properly ornamented, before breakfast she should worship Lord Viñëu and mother Lakñmé, the goddess of fortune, Lord Viñëu's wife, by glorifying Lord Viñëu for His mercy, patience, prowess, ability, greatness and other glories and for how He can bestow all mystic benedictions. While offering the Lord all paraphernalia for worship, such as ornaments, a sacred thread, scents, nice flowers, incense and water for bathing and washing His feet, hands and mouth, one should invite the Lord with this mantra: oà namo bhagavate mahä-puruñäya mahänubhäväya mahävibhütipataye saha mahä-vibhütibhir balim upaharämi. Then one should offer twelve oblations in the fire while chanting this mantra: oà namo bhagavate mahä-puruñäya mahävibhüti-pataye svähä. One should offer obeisances while chanting this mantra ten times. Then one should chant the Lakñmé-Näräyaëa mantra."

            "content": "If either a pregnant woman or her husband regularly discharges this devotional service, both of them will receive the result. After continuing this process for one full year, the chaste wife should fast on the pürëimä, the full-moon day, of Kärttika. On the following day, the husband should worship the Lord as before and then observe a festival by cooking nice food and distributing prasäda to the brähmaëas. Then, with the permission of the brähmaëas, the husband and wife should take prasäda. This chapter ends by glorifying the results of the puàsavana function."
