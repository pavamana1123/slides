She also has a holy name and form, whereas You are the support of all such names and forms and the cause for their manifestation.",

In fact, they represent spiritual activities and the Supersoul of all yajïa.

The first tattva is the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, and the second is the jéva-tattva. Lakñmédevé, being dependent on Lord Viñëu, is sometimes counted among the jévas. The Gauòéya Vaiñëavas, however, describe Lakñmédevé in accordance with the following two verses from the Prameya-ratnävalé of Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa. The first verse is a quotation from the Viñëu Puräëa."
