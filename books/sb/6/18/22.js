Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura stresses that even though Diti was very envious, her heart was purified because of a devotional attitude. Another significant topic is that although Kaçyapa Muni was a learned scholar and was advanced in spiritual consciousness, he nonetheless fell a victim to the inducement of his beautiful wife. All these questions were posed in a small number of words, and therefore Çukadeva Gosvämé very much appreciated Mahäräja Parékñit's inquiry."
