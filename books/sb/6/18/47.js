The general tendency of anyone within this material world is to be envious, and therefore, to become a Kåñëa conscious person, one must curb this tendency, as stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (paramo nirmatsaräëäm ). A Kåñëa conscious person is always nonenvious, whereas others are always envious. Thus Kaçyapa Muni's instruction that his wife not be envious indicates that this is the first stage of advancement in Kåñëa consciousness. Kaçyapa Muni desired to train his wife to be a Kåñëa conscious person, for this would suffice to protect both her and Indra."
