    "translation": "Kaçyapa Muni said: My dear gentle wife, if you follow my instructions regarding this vow for at least one year, you will surely get a son who will be able to kill Indra. However, if you deviate from this vow of following the Vaiñëava principles, you will get a son who will be favorable to Indra.",

            "content": "The word indra-hä refers to an asura who is always eager to kill Indra. An enemy of Indra is naturally a friend to the asuras, but the word indra-hä also refers to one who follows Indra or who is obedient to him. When one becomes a devotee of Indra, he is certainly a friend to the demigods. Thus the words indra-hädeva-bändhavaù are equivocal, for they say, \"Your son will kill Indra, but he will be very friendly to the demigods.\" If a person actually became a friend of the demigods, he certainly would not be able to kill Indra."
