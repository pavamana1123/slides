    "translation": "A husband is the supreme demigod for a woman. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Väsudeva, the husband of the goddess of fortune, is situated in everyone's heart and is worshiped through the various names and forms of the demigods by fruitive workers. Similarly, a husband represents the Lord as the object of worship for a woman.",

            "content": "\"Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunté, is really meant for Me alone, but it is offered without true understanding.\" The demigods are various assistants who act like the hands and legs of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who is not in direct touch with the Supreme Lord and cannot conceive of the exalted position of the Lord is sometimes advised to worship the demigods as various parts of the Lord. If women, who are usually very much attached to their husbands, worship their husbands as representatives of Väsudeva, the women benefit, just as Ajämila benefited by calling for Näräyaëa, his son. Ajämila was concerned with his son, but because of his attachment to the name of Näräyaëa, he attained salvation simply by chanting that name. In India a husband is still called pati-guru, the husband spiritual master. If husband and wife are attached to one another for advancement in Kåñëa consciousness, their relationship of cooperation is very effective for such advancement. Although the names of Indra and Agni are sometimes uttered in the Vedic mantras (indräya svähä, agnaye svähä), the Vedic sacrifices are actually performed for the satisfaction of Lord Viñëu. As long as one is very much attached to material sense gratification, the worship of the demigods or the worship of one's husband is recommended."
