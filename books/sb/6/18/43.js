I shall train her in such a way that instead of always thinking of how to kill Indra, she will become a Vaiñëava, a devotee of Kåñëa. If she agrees to follow the rules and regulations of the Vaiñëava principles, the unclean core of her heart will certainly be cleansed.\" Ceto-darpaëa-märjanam . This is the process of devotional service. Anyone can be purified by following the principles of devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness, for Kåñëa consciousness is so powerful that it can purify even the dirtiest class of men and transform them into the topmost Vaiñëavas. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu's movement aims at this purpose. Narottama däsa Öhäkura says:"

He gave the people of this age the advantage of being able to chant the Hare Kåñëa mantra and thus become fully pure, free from all material contamination. Once one becomes a pure Vaiñëava, he transcends all material conceptions of life. Thus Kaçyapa Muni tried to transform his wife into a Vaiñëavé so that she might give up the idea of killing Indra. He wanted both her and her sons to be purified so that they would be fit to become pure Vaiñëavas. Of course, sometimes a practitioner deviates from the Vaiñëava principles, and there is a chance that he may fall down, but Kaçyapa Muni thought that even if one falls while practicing the Vaiñëava principles, he is still not a loser. Even a fallen Vaiñëava is eligible for better results, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä. Svalpam apy asya dharmasya träyate mahato bhayät: even practicing the Vaiñëava principles to a small extent can save one from the greatest danger of material existence. Thus Kaçyapa Muni planned to instruct his wife Diti to become a Vaiñëava because he wanted to save the life of Indra."
