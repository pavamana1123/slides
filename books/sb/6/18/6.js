    "translation": "Upon seeing Urvaçé, the celestial society girl, both Mitra and Varuëa discharged semen, which they preserved in an earthen pot. The two sons Agastya and Vasiñöha later appeared from that pot, and they are therefore the common sons of Mitra and Varuëa. Mitra begot three sons in the womb of his wife, whose name was Revaté. Their names were Utsarga, Ariñöa and Pippala.",
