Påçni, the wife of Aditi's fifth son named Savitä, had three daughters-Sävitré, Vyähåti and Trayé-and very exalted sons named Agnihotra, Paçu, Soma, Cäturmäsya and the five Mahäyajïas. Siddhi, the wife of Bhaga, had three sons, named Mahimä, Vibhu and Prabhu, and she also had one daughter, whose name was Äçé. Dhätä had four wives-Kuhü, Sinévälé, Räkä and Anumati-who had four sons, named Säyam, Darça, Prätaù and Pürëamäsa respectively. Kriyä, the wife of Vidhätä, gave birth to the five Puréñyas, who are representatives of five kinds of fire-gods. Bhågu, the mind-born son of Brahmä, took his birth again from Carñaëé, the wife of Varuëa, and the great sage Välméki appeared from Varuëa's semen. Agastya and Vasiñöha were two sons of Varuëa and Mitra. Upon seeing the beauty of Urvaçé, Mitra and Varuëa discharged semen, which they kept in an earthen pot. From that pot, Agastya and Vasiñöha appeared. Mitra had a wife named Revaté, who gave birth to three sons-Utsarga, Ariñöa and Pippala. Aditi had twelve sons, of whom Indra was the eleventh. Indra's wife was named Paulomé (Çacédevé). She gave birth to three sons-Jayanta, Åñabha and Méòhuña. By His own powers, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as Vämanadeva. From His wife, whose name was Kérti, appeared a son named Båhatçloka. Båhatçloka's first son was known as Saubhaga. This is a description of the sons of Aditi. A description of Äditya Urukrama, who is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, will be offered in the Eighth Canto."

Hiraëyakaçipu and Hiraëyäkña were the first sons of Diti. Hiraëyakaçipu and his wife, whose name was Kayädhu, had four sons-Saàhläda, Anuhläda, Hläda and Prahläda. They also had one daughter, whose name was Siàhikä. In association with the demon Vipracit, Siàhikä bore a son named Rähu, whose head was severed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kåti, the wife of Saàhläda, bore a son named Païcajana. Hläda's wife, whose name was Dhamani, gave birth to two sons-Vätäpi and Ilvala. Ilvala put Vätäpi into the form of a ram and gave him to Agastya to eat. Anuhläda, in the womb of his wife, Süryä, begot two sons, named Bäñkala and Mahiña. Prahläda's son was known as Virocana, and his grandson was known as Bali Mahäräja. Bali Mahäräja had one hundred sons, of whom Bäëa was the eldest."

            "content": "After describing the dynasty of the Adityas and the other demigods, Çukadeva Gosvämé describes Diti's sons known as the Maruts and how they were elevated to the position of demigods. Just to help Indra, Lord Viñëu had killed Hiraëyäkña and Hiraëyakaçipu. Because of this, Diti was very envious, and she was eager to have a son who could kill Indra. By her service, she enchanted Kaçyapa Muni in order to beg from him a greater son to do this. In corroboration of the Vedic injunction vidväàsam api karñati, Kaçyapa Muni was attracted to his beautiful wife and promised to grant her any request. When, however, she requested a son who would kill Indra, he condemned himself, and he advised his wife Diti to follow the Vaiñëava ritualistic ceremonies to purify herself. When Diti, following the instructions of Kaçyapa, engaged in devotional service, Indra could understand her purpose, and he began observing all her activities. One day, Indra had the opportunity to see her deviating from devotional service. Thus he entered her womb and cut her son into forty-nine parts. In this way the forty-nine kinds of air known as the Maruts appeared, but because Diti had performed the Vaiñëava ritualistic ceremonies, all the sons became Vaiñëavas."
