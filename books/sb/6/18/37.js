    "translation": "Diti replied: O my husband, O great soul, I have now lost my sons. If you want to give me a benediction, I ask you for an immortal son who can kill Indra. I pray for this because Indra, with the help of Viñëu, has killed my two sons Hiraëyäkña and Hiraëyakaçipu.",

            "content": "The word indra-haëam means \"one who can kill Indra,\" but it also means \"one who follows Indra.\" The word amåtyum refers to the demigods, who do not die like ordinary human beings because they have extremely long durations of life. For example, the duration of Lord Brahmä's life is stated in Bhagavad-gétä: sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaëo viduù . Even the duration of one day, or twelve hours, of Brahmä is 4,300,000 years multiplied by one thousand. Thus the duration of his life is inconceivable for an ordinary human being. The demigods are therefore sometimes called amara, which means \"one who has no death.\" In this material world, however, everyone has to die. Therefore the word amåtyum indicates that Diti wanted a son who would be equal in status to the demigods."
