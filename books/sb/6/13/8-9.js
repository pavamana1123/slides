    "translation": "One who has killed a brähmaëa, one who has killed a cow or one who has killed his father, mother or spiritual master can be immediately freed from all sinful reactions simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Näräyaëa. Other sinful persons, such as dog-eaters and caëòälas, who are less than çüdras, can also be freed in this way. But you are a devotee, and we shall help you by performing the great horse sacrifice. If you please Lord Näräyaëa in that way, why should you be afraid? You will be freed even if you kill the entire universe, including the brähmaëas, not to speak of killing a disturbing demon like Våträsura.",

The holy name is so spiritually potent that simply by chanting the holy name one can be freed from the reactions to all sinful activities. What, then, is to be said of those who chant the holy name regularly or worship the Deity regularly? For such purified devotees, freedom from sinful reaction is certainly assured. This does not mean, however, that one should intentionally commit sinful acts and think himself free from the reactions because he is chanting the holy name. Such a mentality is a most abominable offense at the lotus feet of the holy name. Nämno baläd yasya hi päpa-buddhiù: the Lord's holy name certainly has the potency to neutralize all sinful activities, but if one repeatedly and intentionally commits sins while chanting the holy name, he is most condemned."

A son begotten by a brähmaëa and born from the womb of a çüdra mother is called a päraçava or niñäda, a hunter accustomed to stealing. A son begotten by a niñäda in the womb of a çüdra woman is called a pukkasa. A child begotten by a kñatriya in the womb of the daughter of a çüdra is called an ugra. A child begotten by a çüdra in the womb of the daughter of a kñatriya is called a kñattä. A child begotten by a kñatriya in the womb of a lower-class woman is called a çväda, or dog-eater. All such offspring are considered extremely sinful, but the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so strong that all of them can be purified simply by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra."
