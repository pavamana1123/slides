Formerly he had killed one brähmaëa, Viçvarüpa, out of circumstantial anger, but this time, following the advice of the sages, he killed another brähmaëa purposely. Therefore the sinful reaction was greater than before. Indra could not be relieved from the reaction simply by performing sacrifices for atonement. He had to undergo a severe series of sinful reactions, and when he was freed by such suffering, the brähmaëas allowed him to perform the horse sacrifice. The planned execution of sinful deeds on the strength of chanting the holy name of the Lord or undergoing präyaçcitta, atonement, cannot give relief to anyone, even to Indra or Nahuña. Nahuña was officiating for Indra while Indra, absent from heaven, was going here and there to gain release from his sinful reactions."
