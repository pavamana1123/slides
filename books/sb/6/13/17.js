    "translation": "Indra's sins were diminished by the influence of Rudra, the demigod of all directions. Because Indra was protected by the goddess of fortune, Lord Viñëu's wife, who resides in the lotus clusters of Mänasa-sarovara Lake, Indra's sins could not affect him. Indra was ultimately relieved of all the reactions of his sinful deeds by strictly worshiping Lord Viñëu. Then he was called back to the heavenly planets by the brähmaëas and reinstated in his position.",
