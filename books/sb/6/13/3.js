In this case, however, when all the demigods were happy because of Våträsura's having been killed, Indra was unhappy. Why? It may be suggested that Indra was unhappy because he knew that he had killed a great devotee and brähmaëa. Våträsura outwardly appeared to be a demon, but inwardly he was a great devotee and therefore a great brähmaëa."

Therefore in terms of real culture one should not be considered a demigod or demon simply according to birth. In his dealings while fighting with Indra, Våträsura proved himself a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Furthermore, as soon as he finished fighting with Indra and was apparently killed, Våträsura was transferred to Vaikuëöhaloka to become an associate of Saìkarñaëa. Indra knew this, and therefore he was morose at having killed such a demon, who was actually a Vaiñëava or brähmaëa."

This means that an expert brähmaëa may not be a Vaiñëava, but a Vaiñëava is already a brähmaëa. A millionaire may very easily possess hundreds and thousands of dollars, but a person with hundreds and thousands of dollars is not necessarily a millionaire. Våträsura was a perfect Vaiñëava, and therefore he was also a brähmaëa."
