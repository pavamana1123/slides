While instructing Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu described an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava as häté mätä, a mad elephant. When a mad elephant enters a nice garden, it spoils the entire garden. Similarly, if one becomes like a mad elephant and commits offenses at the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava, his entire spiritual career is halted. One should therefore be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava."

The goddess Durgä is called mother, and Lord Çiva is called father. A pure Vaiñëava should be very careful to engage in his specific duty without criticizing others. This is the safest position. Otherwise, if one tends to criticize others, he may commit the great offense of criticizing a Vaiñëava."

            "content": "Because Citraketu was undoubtedly a Vaiñëava, he might have been surprised that Pärvaté had cursed him. Therefore the goddess Pärvaté addressed him as putra, or son. Everyone is the son of mother Durgä, but she is not an ordinary mother. As soon as there is a small discrepancy in a demon's behavior, mother Durgä immediately punishes the demon so that he may come to his senses. This is explained by Lord Kåñëa in Bhagavad-gétä :"

            "content": "\"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.\" To surrender to Kåñëa means to surrender to His devotees also, for no one can be a proper servant of Kåñëa unless he is a proper servant of a devotee. Chäòiyä vaiñëava-sevä nistära päyeche kebä: without serving a servant of Kåñëa, one cannot be elevated to being a servant of Kåñëa Himself. Therefore mother Pärvaté spoke to Citraketu exactly like a mother who says to her naughty child, \"My dear child, I am punishing you so that you won't do anything like this again.\" This tendency of a mother to punish her child is found even in mother Yaçodä, who became the mother of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mother Yaçodä punished Kåñëa by binding Him and showing Him a stick. Thus it is the duty of a mother to chastise her beloved son, even in the case of the Supreme Lord. It is to be understood that mother Durgä was justified in punishing Citraketu. This punishment was a boon to Citraketu because after taking birth as the demon Våträsura, he was promoted directly to Vaikuëöha."
