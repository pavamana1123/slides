    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is one. Unaffected by the conditions of the material world, He creates all the conditioned souls by His own personal potency. Because of being contaminated by the material energy, the living entity is put into ignorance and thus into different conditions of bondage. Sometimes, by knowledge, the living entity is given liberation. In sattva-guëa and rajo-guëa, he is subjected to happiness and distress.",

            "content": "The question may be raised why the living entities are situated in different conditions and who has arranged this. The answer is that it has been done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without anyone's help. The Lord has His own energies (paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate ), and one of them, namely the external energy, creates the material world and the varieties of happiness and distress for the conditioned souls under the supervision of the Lord. The material world consists of three modes of material nature—sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa. By sattva-guëa the Lord maintains the material world, by rajo-guëa He creates it, and by tamo-guëa He annihilates it. After the varieties of living entities are created, they are subject to happiness and distress according to their association. When they are in sattva-guëa, the mode of goodness, they feel happiness, when in rajo-guëa they are distressed, and when in tamo-guëa they have no sense of what to do or what is right and wrong."
