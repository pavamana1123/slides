He knew very well that one suffers or enjoys the results of one's past deeds as ordained by daiva-netra-superior authority, or the agents of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He knew that he had not committed any offense at the lotus feet of Lord Çiva or the goddess Pärvaté, yet he had been punished, and this means that the punishment had been ordained. Thus the King did not mind it. A devotee is naturally so humble and meek that he accepts any condition of life as a blessing from the Lord. Tat te 'nukampäà susamékñamäëaù . A devotee always accepts punishment from anyone as the mercy of the Lord. If one lives in this conception of life, he sees whatever reverses occur to be due to his past misdeeds, and therefore he never accuses anyone. On the contrary, he becomes increasingly attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because of his being purified by his suffering. Suffering, therefore, is also a process of purification."

Indeed, he is beyond karma. The Brahma-saàhitä says, karmäëi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhäjäm: (BS 5.54) a devotee is free from the reactions of his karma because he has taken to devotional service. This same principle is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä . Kñéyante cäsya karmäëi: before attaining the stage of love, one becomes free from all the results of karma."

            "content": "The Lord is very kind and affectionate toward His devotees, and therefore a devotee, in any condition, is not subjected to the results of karma. A devotee never aspires for the heavenly planets. The heavenly planets, liberation and hell are nondifferent for a devotee, for he does not discriminate between different positions in the material world. A devotee is always eager to return home, back to Godhead, and remain there as the Lord's associate. This ambition becomes increasingly fervent in his heart, and therefore he does not care about material changes in his life. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments that Mahäräja Citraketu's being cursed by Pärvaté should be considered the mercy of the Lord. The Lord wanted Citraketu to return to Godhead as soon as possible, and therefore he terminated all the reactions of his past deeds. Acting through the heart of Pärvaté, the Lord, who is situated in everyone's heart, cursed Citraketu in order to end all his material reactions. Thus Citraketu became Våträsura in his next life and returned home, back to Godhead."
