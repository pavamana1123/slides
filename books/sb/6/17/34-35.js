They are always peaceful, and they are equal to everyone.",

But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.\" From this statement by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is clear that the devotees of the Lord are always extremely dear to Him. In effect, Lord Çiva told Pärvaté, \"Both Citraketu and I are always very dear to the Supreme Lord. In other words, both he and I are on the same level as servants of the Lord. We are always friends, and sometimes we enjoy joking words between us. When Citraketu loudly laughed at my behavior, he did so on friendly terms, and therefore there was no reason to curse him.\" Thus Lord Çiva tried to convince his wife, Pärvaté, that her cursing of Citraketu was not very sensible."

Lord Çiva could understand Citraketu very nicely, but Pärvaté could not. Thus even in the higher statuses of life there is a difference between the understanding of a male and that of a female. It may be clearly said that the understanding of a woman is always inferior to the understanding of a man. In the Western countries there is now agitation to the effect that man and woman should be considered equal, but from this verse it appears that woman is always less intelligent than man."

Then, too, Lord Çiva wanted to criticize Citraketu for externally posing as a great devotee but being interested in enjoying with the Vidyädharé women. These were all friendly jokes; there was nothing serious for which Citraketu should have been cursed by Pärvaté. Upon hearing the instructions of Lord Çiva, Pärvaté must have been very much ashamed for cursing Citraketu to become a demon. Mother Pärvaté could not appreciate Citraketu's position, and therefore she cursed him, but when she understood the instructions of Lord Çiva she was ashamed."
