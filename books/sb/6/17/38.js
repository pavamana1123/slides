    "translation": "Being cursed by mother Durgä [Bhaväné, the wife of Lord Çiva], that same Citraketu accepted birth in a demoniac species of life. Although still fully equipped with transcendental knowledge and practical application of that knowledge in life, he appeared as a demon at the fire sacrifice performed by Tvañöä, and thus he became famous as Våträsura.",

Although Våträsura appeared in a family of demons, it is clearly said that his knowledge of spiritual life still existed. Jïäna-vijïäna-saàyutaù: his spiritual knowledge and the practical application of that knowledge in life were not lost. Therefore it is said that even if a devotee falls down for some reason, he is still not lost."

This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä. Even if a bhakti-yogé falls, he takes birth in a rich family or family of brähmaëas, in which he again starts devotional activities from the point where he left off. Although Våträsura was known as an asura, or demon, he did not lose his consciousness of Kåñëa or devotional service."
