Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, however, has made the following observations. Lord Çiva, being the most exalted Vaiñëava and one of the most powerful demigods, is able to do anything he desires. Although he was externally exhibiting the behavior of a common man and not following etiquette, such actions cannot diminish his exalted position. The difficulty is that a common man, seeing Lord Çiva's behavior, might follow his example. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä :"

And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.\" A common man might also criticize Lord Çiva, like Dakña, who suffered the consequences for his criticism. King Citraketu desired that Lord Çiva cease this external behavior so that others might be saved from criticizing him and thus becoming offenders. If one thinks that Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the only perfect personality whereas the demigods, even such demigods as Lord Çiva, are inclined to improper social affairs, he is an offender. Considering all this, King Citraketu was somewhat harsh in his behavior with Lord Çiva."

The members of the assembly surrounding Lord Çiva could also understand Citraketu's purpose. Consequently, following the behavior of Lord Çiva, they did not protest; instead, following their master, they remained silent. If the members of the assembly thought that Citraketu had blasphemed Lord Çiva, they would certainly have left at once, blocking their ears with their hands."
