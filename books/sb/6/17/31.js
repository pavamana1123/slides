A devotee does not need to cultivate knowledge to understand the falsity or temporary existence of this material world. Because of his unalloyed devotion to Väsudeva, this knowledge and detachment are automatically manifested in his person. As confirmed elsewhere in Çrémad-Bhägavatam "

            "content": "One who engages in unalloyed devotional service to Väsudeva, Kåñëa, automatically becomes aware of this material world, and therefore he is naturally detached. This detachment is possible because of his high standard of knowledge. The speculative philosopher tries to understand that this material world is false by cultivating knowledge, but this understanding is automatically manifested in the person of a devotee, without separate endeavor. The Mäyävädé philosophers may be very proud of their so-called knowledge, but because they do not understand Väsudeva (väsudevaù sarvam iti ), they do not understand the world of duality, which is a manifestation of Väsudeva's external energy. Therefore, unless the so-called jïänés take shelter of Väsudeva, their speculative knowledge is imperfect. Ye 'nye 'ravindäkña vimukta-mäninaù. They simply think of becoming free from the contamination of the material world, but because they do not take shelter at the lotus feet of Väsudeva, their knowledge is impure. When they actually become pure, they surrender to the lotus feet of Väsudeva. Therefore, the Absolute Truth is easier to understand for a devotee than for jïänés who simply speculate to understand Väsudeva. Lord Çiva confirms this statement in the following verse."
