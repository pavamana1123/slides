Therefore Çukadeva Gosvämé advised that the history of Citraketu be heard from a devotee. Anything about devotional service or the characteristics of the Lord and His devotees must be heard from a devotee, not from a professional reciter. This is advised herein. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu's secretary also advised that one learn the history of Çrémad-Bhägavatam from a devotee: yäha, bhägavata pada vaiñëavera sthäne. One should not hear the statements of Çrémad-Bhägavatam from professional reciters, or else they will not be effective. Quoting from Padma Puräëa, Çré Sanätana Gosvämé has strictly forbidden us to hear about the activities of the Lord and His devotees from the mouths of nondevotees:"
