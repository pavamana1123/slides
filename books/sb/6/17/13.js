    "translation": "This Citraketu is the lowest of kñatriyas, for he has impudently overridden Brahmä and the other demigods by insulting Lord Çiva, upon whose lotus feet they always meditate. Lord Çiva is personified religion and the spiritual master of the entire world, and therefore Citraketu must be punished.",

Citraketu nonetheless criticized Lord Çiva, and therefore the opinion of Pärvaté was that he should be punished."
