Although we are part of the Supreme Lord, we consider ourselves independent, separate controllers, and thus we cannot understand His identity.",

He is absolute, infallible and beginningless, and although expanded into unlimited forms, He is still the same original person, the oldest person, who always appears as a fresh youth. The eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord can not be understood even by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.\" Lord Çiva places himself as one of the nondevotees, who cannot understand the identity of the Supreme Lord. The Lord, being ananta, has an unlimited number of forms. Therefore, how is it possible for an ordinary, common man to understand Him? Lord Çiva, of course, is above the ordinary human beings, yet be is unable to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Çiva is not among the ordinary living entities, nor is he in the category of Lord Viñëu. He is between Lord Viñëu and the common living entity."
