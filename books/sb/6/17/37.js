    "translation": "The great devotee Citraketu was so powerful that he was quite competent to curse mother Pärvaté in retaliation, but instead of doing so he very humbly accepted the curse and bowed his head before Lord Çiva and his wife. This is very much to be appreciated as the standard behavior of a Vaiñëava.",

            "content": "Upon being informed by Lord Çiva, mother Pärvaté could understand that she was wrong in cursing Citraketu. King Citraketu was so exalted in his character that in spite of being wrongly cursed by Pärvaté, he immediately descended from his airplane and bowed his head before the mother, accepting her curse. This has already been explained: näräyaëa-paräù sarve na kutaçcana bibhyati . Citraketu very sportingly felt that since the mother wanted to curse him, he could accept this curse just to please her. This is called sädhu-lakñaëam, the characteristic of a sädhu, or a devotee. As explained by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, tåëäd api sunécena taror api sahiñëunä. A devotee should always be very humble and meek and should offer all respect to others, especially to superiors. Being protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a devotee is always powerful, but a devotee does not wish to show his power unnecessarily. However, when a less intelligent person has some power, he wants to use it for sense gratification. This is not the behavior of a devotee."
