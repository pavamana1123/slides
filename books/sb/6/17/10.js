    "translation": "Not knowing the prowess of Lord Çiva and Pärvaté, Citraketu strongly criticized them. His statements were not at all pleasing, and therefore the goddess Pärvaté, being very angry, spoke as follows to Citraketu, who thought himself better than Lord Çiva in controlling the senses.",

It is said, tejéyasäà na doñäya: one who is very powerful should be understood to be faultless. For example, one should not find faults with the sun, although it evaporates urine from the street. The most powerful cannot be criticized by an ordinary man, or even by a great personality. Citraketu should have known that Lord Çiva, although sitting in that way, was not to be criticized. The difficulty was that Citraketu, having become a great devotee of Lord Viñëu, Saìkarñaëa, was somewhat proud at having achieved Lord Saìkarñaëa's favor and therefore thought that he could now criticize anyone, even Lord Çiva. This kind of pride in a devotee is never tolerated. A Vaiñëava should always remain very humble and meek and offer respect to others."

In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.\" A Vaiñëava should not try to minimize anyone else's position. It is better to remain humble and meek and chant the Hare Kåñëa mantra. The word nirjitätmäbhimänine indicates that Citraketu thought himself a better controller of the senses than Lord Çiva, although actually he was not. Because of all these considerations, mother Pärvaté was somewhat angry at Citraketu."
