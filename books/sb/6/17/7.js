    "translation": "Lord Çiva, whose hair is matted on his head, has certainly undergone great austerities and penances. Indeed, he is the president in the assembly of strict followers of Vedic principles. Nonetheless, he is seated with his wife on his lap in the midst of saintly persons and is embracing her as if he were a shameless, ordinary human being.",

He appreciated Lord Çiva's position, but when he saw Lord Çiva sitting in the midst of saintly persons and acting like a shameless, ordinary man, he was astonished. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura remarks that although Citraketu criticized Lord Çiva, he did not offend Lord Çiva like Dakña. Dakña considered Lord Çiva insignificant, but Citraketu expressed his wonder at Lord Çiva's being situated in that way."
