In this connection there is a statement by Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté: viçvaà pürëa-sukhäyate. Everyone in this material world is distressed by miserable conditions, but Çréla Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté says that this world is full of happiness. How is this possible? He answers, yat-käruëya-katäkña-vaibhavavatäà taà gauram eva stumaù. A devotee accepts the distress of this material world as happiness only due to the causeless mercy of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. By His personal behavior, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu showed that He was never distressed but always happy in chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. One should follow in the footsteps of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and engage constantly in chanting the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Then he will never feel the distresses of the world of duality. In any condition of life one will be happy if he chants the holy name of the Lord."

Because the same mind and body exist in the same material world of duality when we are awake, the so-called happiness and distress of this world are no better than the false, superficial happiness of dreams. The mind is the via medium in both dreams and wakefulness, and everything created by the mind in terms of saìkalpa and vikalpa, acceptance and rejection, is called manodharma, or mental concoction."
