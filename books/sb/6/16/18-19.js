O reservoir of spiritual potency, O supreme bliss, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who are self-sufficient and most peaceful.

In transcendental knowledge, the Lord is addressed as praëava, oàkära, which is a symbolic representation of the Lord in sound. Oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya. Väsudeva, who is an expansion of Näräyaëa, expands Himself as Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Saìkarñaëa. From Saìkarñaëa comes a second Näräyaëa expansion, and from this Näräyaëa come further expansions of Väsudeva, Pradyumna, Saìkarñaëa and Aniruddha. The Saìkarñaëa in this group is the original cause of the three puruñas, namely Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu is situated in every universe in a special planet called Çvetadvépa. This is confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä: aëòäntara-stha. The word aëòa means this universe. Within this universe is a planet called Çvetadvépa, where Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu is situated. From Him come all the incarnations within this universe."

They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\" In the conditioned state of life, the body is used as our dress, and as one needs different dresses during the summer and winter, we conditioned souls are changing bodies according to our desires. However, because the body of the Supreme Lord is full of knowledge, it needs no covering. The idea that Kåñëa's body is like ours—in other words, that His body and soul are different—is a misunderstanding. There are no such differences for Kåñëa, because His body is full of knowledge. Here we receive material bodies because of a lack of knowledge, but because Kåñëa, Väsudeva, is full of knowledge, there is no difference between His body and His soul. Kåñëa remembers what He said forty million years ago to the sun-god, but an ordinary being cannot remember what he said the day before yesterday. This is the difference between Kåñëa's body and our body. Therefore the Lord is addressed as vijïäna-mäträya paramänanda-mürtaye."

This is confirmed in the Vedänta-sütra: änandamayo'bhyäsät. By nature the Lord is änandamaya. Whenever we see Kåñëa, He is always full of änanda in all circumstances. No one can make Him morose. Ätmärämäya: He does not need to search for external enjoyment, because He is self-sufficient. Çäntäya: He has no anxiety. One who has to seek pleasure from other sources is always full of anxiety. Karmés, jïänés and yogés are full of anxiety because they want something, but a devotee does not want anything; he is simply satisfied in the service of the Lord, who is fully blissful."
