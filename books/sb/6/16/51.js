Now, because of Citraketu's devotional service, he has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By performing devotional service, one advances step by step, and when one is on the platform of love of Godhead (premä pumartho mahän) he sees the Supreme Lord at every moment. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, when one engages in devotional service twenty-four hours a day (teñäà satata-yuktänäà bhajatäà préti-pürvakam ) in accordance with the instructions of the spiritual master, his devotional service becomes more and more pleasing. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is within the core of everyone's heart, speaks to the devotee (dadämi buddhi-yogaà taà yena mäm upayänti te). Citraketu Mahäräja was first instructed by his gurus, Aìgirä and Närada, and now, having followed their instructions, he has come to the stage of seeing the Supreme Lord face to face. Therefore the Lord is now instructing him in the essence of knowledge."

Vikarma, however, refers to illusory activities, which are something like the will-o'-the-wisp. These are activities that have no meaning. For example, modern scientists imagine that life can be produced from chemical combinations, and they are very busy trying to prove this in laboratories throughout the world, although no one in history has been able to produce the substance of life from material combinations.

In His eternal, blissful form, Lord Kåñëa is accepted by Arjuna as paraà brahma. A living entity in the conditioned stage accepts something illusory as substantial. This is called mäyä or avidyä—ignorance. Therefore according to the Vedic knowledge, one must become a devotee, and one must then distinguish between avidyä and vidyä, which are elaborately explained in the Éçopaniñad. When one is actually on the platform of vidyä, he can personally understand the Personality of Godhead in His forms like those of Lord Räma, Lord Kåñëa and Saìkarñaëa. The Vedic knowledge is described as the breathing of the Supreme Lord, and activities begin on the basis of Vedic knowledge. Therefore the Lord says that when He endeavors or breathes, the material universes come into existence, and various activities gradually develop. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä, praëavaù sarva-vedeñu: \"I am the syllable oà in all the Vedic mantras.\" Vedic knowledge begins with the vibration of the transcendental sound praëava, oàkära. The same transcendental sound is Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Abhinnatvän näma-näminoù:  there is no difference between the holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself."
