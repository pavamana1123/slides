    "translation": "Thereafter, by controlling his mind with his intelligence and thus restricting his senses from external engagements, he recovered suitable words with which to express his feelings. Thus he began offering prayers to the Lord, who is the personification of the holy scriptures [the sätvata-saàhitäs like the Brahma-saàhitä and the Närada-païcarätra] and who is the spiritual master of all. He offered his prayers as follows.",

Then he can find suitable words to offer in prayers to the Lord.

The words sätvata-çästra-vigraham indicate that the sac-cid-änanda (BS 5.1) body of the Lord can never be accepted to be made of mäyä. Devotees do not offer prayers to the Lord in an imaginary form. The existence of the Lord's form is supported by all Vedic literature."
