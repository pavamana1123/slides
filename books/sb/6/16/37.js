While He sleeps in that ocean, millions of universes are generated as He exhales, and they are all annihilated when He inhales. This Mahä-Viñëu is a plenary portion of a portion of Viñëu, Govinda (yasya kalä-viçeñaù). The word kalä refers to a plenary portion of a plenary portion. From Kåñëa, or Govinda, comes Balaräma; from Balaräma comes Saìkarñaëa; from Saìkarñaëa, Näräyaëa; from Näräyaëa, the second Saìkarñaëa; from the second Saìkarñaëa, Mahä-Viñëu; from Mahä-Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu; and from Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu controls every universe. This gives an idea of the meaning of ananta, unlimited. What is to be said of the unlimited potency and existence of the Lord? This verse describes the coverings of the universe (saptabhir daça-guëottarair aëòa-koçaù). The first covering is earth, the second is water, the third is fire, the fourth is air, the fifth is sky, the sixth is the total material energy, and the seventh is the false ego. Beginning with the covering of earth, each covering is ten times greater than the previous one. Thus we can only imagine how great each universe is, and there are many millions of universes. As confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä :"
