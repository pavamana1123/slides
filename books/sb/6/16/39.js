    "translation": "O Supreme Lord, if persons obsessed with material desires for sense gratification through material opulence worship You, who are the source of all knowledge and are transcendental to material qualities, they are not subject to material rebirth, just as sterilized or fried seeds do not produce plants. Living entities are subjected to the repetition of birth and death because they are conditioned by material nature, but since You are transcendental, one who is inclined to associate with You in transcendence escapes the conditions of material nature.",

            "content": "\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\" If one simply engages in Kåñëa consciousness to understand Kåñëa, he surely becomes immune to the process of repeated birth and death. As clearly stated in Bhagavad-gétä, tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti:  such a person, simply by engaging in Kåñëa consciousness or understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, becomes quite fit to return home, back to Godhead. Even those who are obsessed with material desires may also come to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead so steadily that they go back to Godhead. The fact is that if one comes to Kåñëa consciousness, although he may have many material desires, he becomes increasingly attracted to the lotus feet of Kåñëa through associating with the Supreme Lord by chanting His holy name. The Supreme Lord and His holy name are identical. Thus he becomes uninterested in attachment to material enjoyment. The perfection of life is to be uninterested in material enjoyment and interested in Kåñëa. If one comes to Kåñëa consciousness somehow or other, even for material gain, the result is that he will be liberated. Kämäd dveñäd bhayät snehät. Whether for the satisfaction of material desires, because of the influence of envy, because of fear, because of affection or because of any other reason, if one comes to Kåñëa, his life is successful."
