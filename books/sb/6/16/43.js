Again, the Puräëas and other Vedic literatures set forth four äçramas, which are the divisions of spiritual life.

A civilization of Äryans who strictly follow the instructions of the Lord and never deviate from those instructions is perfect. Such civilized men do not discriminate between trees, animals, human beings and other living entities. paëòitäù sama-darçinaù:  because they are completely educated in Kåñëa consciousness, they see all living beings equally. Äryans do not kill even a small plant unnecessarily, not to speak of cutting trees for sense gratification. At the present moment, throughout the world, killing is prominent. Men are killing trees, they are killing animals, and they are killing other human beings also, all for sense gratification. This is not an Äryan civilization. As stated here, sthira-cara-sattva-kadambeñv apåthag-dhiyaù. The word apåthag-dhiyaù indicates that Äryans do not distinguish between lower and higher grades of life. All life should be protected. All living beings have a right to live, even the trees and plants. This is the basic principle of an Äryan civilization. Apart from the lower living entities, those who have come to the platform of human civilization should be divided into a society of brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras. The brähmaëas should follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as stated in Bhagavad-gétä and other Vedic literatures. The criterion must be guëa and karma. In other words, one should acquire the qualities of a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra and act accordingly. This is the civilization accepted by the Äryans. Why do they accept it? They accept it because they are very much eager to satisfy Kåñëa. This is perfect civilization."
