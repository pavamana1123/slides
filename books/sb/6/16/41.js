    "translation": "Being full of contradictions, all forms of religion but bhägavata-dharma work under conceptions of fruitive results and distinctions of \"you and I\" and \"yours and mine.\" The followers of Çrémad-Bhägavatam have no such consciousness. They are all Kåñëa conscious, thinking that they are Kåñëa's and Kåñëa is theirs. There are other, low-class religious systems, which are contemplated for the killing of enemies or the gain of mystic power, but such religious systems, being full of passion and envy, are impure and temporary. Because they are full of envy, they are full of irreligion.",

If one advocates the Hindu religion, the Muslim religion, the Christian religion, this religion or that religion, there will be conflicts. History shows that the followers of religious systems without a clear conception of God have fought with one another. There are many instances of this in human history, but systems of religion that do not concentrate upon service to the Supreme are temporary and cannot last for long because they are full of envy. There are many activities directed against such religious systems, and therefore one must give up the idea of \"my belief\" and \"your belief.\" Everyone should believe in God and surrender unto Him. That is bhägavata-dharma."

            "content": "Bhägavata-dharma is not a concocted sectarian belief, for it entails research to find how everything is connected with Kåñëa (éçäväsyam idaà sarvam ). According to the Vedic injunctions, sarvaà khalv idaà brahma: Brahman, the Supreme, is present in everything. Bhägavata-dharma captures this presence of the Supreme. Bhägavata-dharma does not consider everything in the world to be false. Because everything emanates from the Supreme, nothing can be false; everything has some use in the service of the Supreme. For example, we are now dictating into a microphone and recording on a dictating machine, and thus we are finding how the machine can be connected to the Supreme Brahman. Since we are using this machine in the service of the Lord, it is Brahman. This is the meaning of sarvaà khalv idaà brahma. Everything is Brahman because everything can be used for the service of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is mithyä, false; everything is factual."

Pure bhägavatas, pure devotees, invite everyone, without envy, to join the Kåñëa consciousness movement. A devotee is therefore exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Suhådaà sarva-bhütänäm:  he is the friend of all living entities. Therefore this is the best of all religious systems. Whereas so-called religions are meant for a particular type of person who believes in a particular way, such discrimination has no place in Kåñëa consciousness, or bhägavata-dharma. If we scrutinize the religious systems meant for worship of demigods or anyone else but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we will find that they are full of envy and therefore impure."
