They can keep You under their control because You are causelessly merciful to devotees who desire no material profit from You. Indeed, You give Yourself to them, and because of this You also have full control over Your devotees.",

Because of being conquered by one another, they both derive transcendental bliss from their relationship. The highest perfection of this mutual conquering is exhibited by Kåñëa and the gopés. The gopés conquered Kåñëa, and Kåñëa conquered the gopés. Thus whenever Kåñëa played His flute, He conquered the minds of the gopés, and without seeing the gopés Kåñëa could not be happy. Other transcendentalists, such as jïänés and yogés, cannot conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead; only pure devotees can conquer Him."

It is not that devotees worship the Supreme Lord only when happy; they worship Him even when in distress. Happiness and distress do not hamper the process of devotional service. Therefore Çrémad-Bhägavatam says that devotional service is ahaituky apratihatä, unmotivated and uninterrupted. When a devotee offers devotional service to the Lord without any motive (anyäbhiläñitä-çünyam [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11], his service cannot be hampered by any material condition (apratihatä). Thus a devotee who offers service in all conditions of life can conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

            "content": "A special distinction between devotees and the other transcendentalists, namely the jïänés and yogés, is that jïänés and yogés artificially try to become one with the Supreme, whereas devotees never aspire for such an impossible accomplishment. Devotees know that their position is to be eternally servants of the Supreme Lord and never to be one with Him. Therefore they are called sama-mati or jitätmä. They detest oneness with the Supreme. They have no lusty desires for oneness; instead, their desire is to be freed from all material hankering. Therefore they are called niñkäma, desireless. A living entity cannot exist without desires, but desires that can never be fulfilled are called käma, lusty desires. Kämais tais tair håta jïänäù:  because of lusty desires, nondevotees are deprived of their intelligence. Thus they are unable to conquer the Supreme Lord, whereas devotees, being freed from such unreasonable desires, can conquer the Lord. Such devotees are also conquered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they are pure, being free from all material desires, they fully surrender to the Supreme Lord, and therefore the Lord conquers them. Such devotees never aspire for liberation. They simply desire to serve the lotus feet of the Lord. Because they serve the Lord without desires for remuneration, they can conquer the mercy of the Lord. The Lord is by nature very merciful, and when He sees that His servant is working without desires for material profit, naturally He is conquered."

When a devotee fully surrenders and has no aspiration for material profit, the Lord certainly gives him all opportunities for service. This is the position of the Lord when conquered by His devotees."
