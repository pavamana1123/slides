Because you are now educated in the spiritual science, you have seen Me face to face. Therefore you are now completely perfect.",

When one is perfect in knowledge, he can develop his love of Godhead through the association of such perfect persons as Närada and Aìgirä and the members of their disciplic succession. Then one is able to see the unlimited Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. Although the Lord is unlimited, by His causeless mercy He becomes visible to the devotee, who is then able to see Him. In our present position of conditioned life we cannot see or understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
