    "translation": "Therefore, my dear Lord, simply seeing You has now wiped away all the contamination of sinful activities and their results of material attachment and lusty desires, which always filled my mind and the core of my heart.

Then one will be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead even with one's own eyes. One only needs training. Ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi na bhaved grähyam indriyaiù . With our blunt eyes and other senses we cannot perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but if we engage our senses in the service of the Lord according to the instructions of the authorities, it will be possible to see Him. As soon as one sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all the sinful reactions in the core of one's heart are certainly vanquished."
