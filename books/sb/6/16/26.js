However, after the death of Citraketu's son, Aìgirä brought Närada to instruct King Citraketu about bhakti-yoga. The difference was that in the beginning Citraketu was not in a temperament of renunciation, but after the death of his son, when he was overwhelmed by his great plight, he was awakened to the platform of renunciation by instructions regarding the falsity of this material world and material possessions. It is only at this stage that bhakti-yoga can be instructed. As long as one is attached to material enjoyment, bhakti-yoga cannot be understood. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä :"

They are practically disgusted with material pleasure from material sources, and this has resulted in a population of hippies throughout the Western countries. Now if these young people are instructed about bhakti-yoga, Kåñëa consciousness, the instructions will certainly be effective."

In this regard Çréla Särvabhauma Bhaööäcärya has said, vairägya-vidyä-nija-bhakti-yoga . Advancement in devotional service, or Kåñëa consciousness, is characterized by increasing renunciation of material enjoyment. Närada Muni is the father of devotional service, and therefore, just to bestow causeless mercy upon King Citraketu, Aìgirä brought Närada Muni to instruct the King. These instructions were extremely effective. Anyone who follows in the footsteps of Närada Muni is certainly a pure devotee."
