    "translation": "By His inconceivable internal potency, the Supreme Personality of Godhead expands into various transcendental bodies as Vämanadeva, the incarnation of strength among the demigods; Paraçuräma, the incarnation among saints; Nåsiàhadeva and Varäha, incarnations among animals; and Matsya and Kürma, incarnations among aquatics. He accepts various transcendental bodies among all types of living entities, and among human beings He especially appears as Lord Kåñëa and Lord Räma. By His causeless mercy, He protects the demigods, who are always harassed by the demons. He is the supreme worshipable Deity of all living entities. He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies. Although different from this universe, He exists in His universal form [viräö-rüpa]. In our fearful condition, let us take shelter of Him, for we are sure that the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Soul, will give us His protection.",

As stated herein, paraà pradhänaà puruñaà viçvam anyam: \"He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies. Although different from this universe, He exists in His universal form [viräö rüpa].\" The word prakåti, which is used to indicate the source of generation, refers to the material energy of the Supreme Lord, and the word puruña refers to the living entities, who are the superior energy of the Lord. Both the prakåti and puruña ultimately enter the Supreme Lord, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä ( prakåtià yänti mämikäm)."
