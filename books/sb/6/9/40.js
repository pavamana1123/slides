O most beautiful person within the three worlds! Everything and everyone, including human beings and even the Daitya demons and the Dänavas, is but an expansion of Your energy. O supremely powerful one, You have always appeared in Your forms as the various incarnations to punish the demons as soon as they become very powerful. You appear as Lord Vämanadeva, Lord Räma and Lord Kåñëa. You appear sometimes as an animal like Lord Boar, sometimes a mixed incarnation like Lord Nåsiàhadeva and Lord Hayagréva, and sometimes an aquatic like Lord Fish and Lord Tortoise. Assuming such various forms, You have always punished the demons and Dänavas. We therefore pray that Your Lordship appear today as another incarnation, if You so desire, to kill the great demon Våträsura.",

Pure devotees are akäma, whereas devotees in the upper planetary systems, such as the demigods, are called sakäma because they still want to enjoy material opulence. Because of their pious activities, the sakäma devotees are promoted to the higher planetary systems, but at heart they still desire to lord it over the material resources. The sakäma devotees are sometimes disturbed by the demons and Räkñasas, but the Lord is so kind that He always saves them by appearing as an incarnation. The Lord's incarnations are so powerful that Lord Vämanadeva covered the entire universe with two steps and therefore had no place for His third step. The Lord is called Trivikrama because He showed His strength by delivering the entire universe with merely three steps."

Even if an akäma devotee is suffering, he thinks this is due to his past impious activities and agrees to suffer the consequences. He never disturbs the Lord. Sakäma devotees immediately pray to the Lord as soon as they are in difficulty, but they are regarded as pious because they consider themselves fully dependent on the mercy of the Lord.

In this way they become firmly fixed in devotional service and eligible to return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt. Sakäma devotees, of course, achieve from the Lord the results they desire from their prayers, but they do not immediately become fit to return to Godhead. It is to be noted herein that Lord Viñëu, in His various incarnations, is always the protector of His devotees. Çréla Madhväcärya says: vividhaà bhäva-pätratvät sarve viñëor vibhütayaù. Kåñëa is the original Personality of Godhead (kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam ). All the other incarnations proceed from Lord Viñëu."
