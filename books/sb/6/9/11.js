            "content": "There was some defect in Tvañöä's chanting of the mantra because he chanted it long instead of short, and therefore the meaning changed. Tvañöä intended to chant the word indra-çatro, meaning, \"O enemy of Indra.\" In this mantra, the word indra is in the possessive case (ñañöhé), and the word indra-çatro is called a tat-puruña compound (tatpuruña-samäsa). Unfortunately, instead of chanting the mantra short, Tvañöä chanted it long, and its meaning changed from \"the enemy of Indra\" to \"Indra, who is an enemy.\" Consequently instead of an enemy of Indra's, there emerged the body of Våträsura, of whom Indra was the enemy."
