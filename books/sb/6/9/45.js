    "translation": "O Lord, O supreme pure, You live within the core of everyone's heart and observe all the desires and activities of the conditioned souls. O Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Lord Kåñëa, Your reputation is bright and illuminating. You have no beginning, for You are the beginning of everything. This is understood by pure devotees because You are easily accessible to the pure and truthful. When the conditioned souls are liberated and sheltered at Your lotus feet after roving throughout the material world for many millions of years, they attain the highest success of life. Therefore, O Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, we offer our respectful obeisances at Your lotus feet.",

Demons, or atheists, always disturb the demigods, or devotees, and therefore Kåñëa descends to punish the atheists and demons and fulfill the desire of His devotees.

Those who are liberated from the bondage of conditioned life are elevated to the spiritual world, where they achieve five kinds of liberation—säyujya, sälokya, särüpya, särñöi and sämépya . They personally associate with the Lord in five mellows—çänta, däsya, sakhya, vätsalya and mädhurya. These rasas are all emanations from Kåñëa. As described by Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the original mellow, ädi-rasa, is conjugal love. Kåñëa is the origin of pure and spiritual conjugal love."
