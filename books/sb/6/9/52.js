It is said that Dadhyaïca gave them mantras through the head of a horse. Therefore the mantras are called Açvaçira. After obtaining the mantras of spiritual science from Dadhéci, the Açviné-kumäras became jévan-mukta, liberated even in this life.",

            "content": "The great saint Dadhéci had perfect knowledge of how to perform fruitive activities, and he had advanced spiritual knowledge as well. Knowing this, the Açviné-kumäras once approached him and begged him to instruct them in spiritual science (brahma-vidyä). Dadhéci Muni replied, \"I am now engaged in arranging sacrifices for fruitive activities. Come back some time later.\" When the Açviné-kumäras left, Indra, the King of heaven, approached Dadhéci and said, \"My dear Muni, the Açviné-kumäras are only physicians. Please do not instruct them in spiritual science. If you impart the spiritual science to them despite my warning, I shall punish you by cutting off your head.\" After warning Dadhéci in this way, Indra returned to heaven. The Açviné-kumäras, who understood Indra's desires, returned and begged Dadhéci for brahma-vidyä. When the great saint Dadhéci informed them of Indra's threat, the Açviné-kumäras replied, \"Let us first cut off your head and replace it with the head of a horse. You can instruct brahma-vidyä through the horse's head, and when Indra returns and cuts off that head, we shall reward you and restore your original head.\" Since Dadhéci had promised to impart brahma-vidyä to the Açviné-kumäras, he agreed to their proposal. Therefore, because Dadhéci imparted brahma-vidyä through the mouth of a horse, this brahma-vidyä is also known as Açvaçira."
