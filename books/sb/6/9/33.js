    "translation": "O Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Näräyaëa, O Väsudeva, original person! O most exalted person, supreme experience, welfare personified! O supreme benediction, supremely merciful and changeless! O support of the cosmic manifestation, sole proprietor of all planetary systems, master of everything and husband of the goddess of fortune! Your Lordship is realized by the topmost sannyäsés, who wander about the world to preach Kåñëa consciousness, fully absorbed in samädhi through bhakti-yoga. Because their minds are concentrated upon You, they can receive the conception of Your personality in their fully purified hearts. When the darkness in their hearts is completely eradicated and You are revealed to them, the transcendental bliss they enjoy is the transcendental form of Your Lordship. No one but such persons can realize You. Therefore we simply offer You our respectful obeisances.",

            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead has numerous transcendental names pertaining to different grades of revelation to various grades of devotees and transcendentalists. When He is realized in His impersonal form He is called the Supreme Brahman, when realized as the Paramätmä He is called antaryämé, and when He expands Himself in different forms for material creation He is called Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu. When He is realized as Väsudeva, Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha—the Caturvyüha, who are beyond the three forms of Viñëu—He is the Vaikuëöha Näräyaëa. Above realization of Näräyaëa is realization of Baladeva, and above that is realization of Kåñëa. All these realizations are possible when one engages fully in devotional service. The covered core of one's heart is then completely open to receiving an understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His various forms."
