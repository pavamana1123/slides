    "translation": "O Lord, You need no support, and although You have no material body, You do not need cooperation from us. Since You are the cause of the cosmic manifestation and You supply its material ingredients without being transformed, You create, maintain and annihilate this cosmic manifestation by Yourself. Nevertheless, although You appear engaged in material activity, You are transcendental to all material qualities. Consequently these transcendental activities of Yours are extremely difficult to understand.",

            "content": "The Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38) says, goloka eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is always situated in Goloka Våndävana. It is also said, våndävanaà parityajya padam ekaà na gacchati: Kåñëa never goes even a step from Våndävana. Nevertheless, although Kåñëa is situated in His own abode, Goloka Våndävana, He is simultaneously all-pervading and is therefore present everywhere. This is very difficult for a conditioned soul to understand, but devotees can understand how Kåñëa, without undergoing any changes, can simultaneously be in His abode and be all-pervasive. The demigods are understood to be various limbs of the Supreme Lord's body, although the Supreme Lord has no material body and does not need anyone's help. He is spread everywhere (mayä tatam idaà sarvaà jagad avyakta-mürtinä ). Nevertheless, He is not present everywhere in His spiritual form. According to the Mäyäväda philosophy, the Supreme Truth, being all-pervasive, does not need a transcendental form. The Mäyävädés suppose that since His form is distributed everywhere, He has no form. This is untrue. The Lord keeps His transcendental form, and at the same time He extends everywhere, in every nook and corner of the material creation."
