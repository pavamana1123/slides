    "translation": "With deliberation, one will see that the Supreme Soul, although manifested in different ways, is actually the basic principle of everything. The total material energy is the cause of the material manifestation, but the material energy is caused by Him. Therefore He is the cause of all causes, the manifester of intelligence and the senses. He is perceived as the Supersoul of everything. Without Him, everything would be dead. You, as that Supersoul, the supreme controller, are the only one remaining.",

He is the pratyak, or antaryämé, of all living entities. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä , kñetra-jïaà cäpi mäà viddhi sarva-kñetreñu bhärata: \"O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies.\" Because the Lord is the Supersoul, He is the active principle of every living entity and even the atom (aëòäntara-stha-paramäëu-cayäntara-stham). He is the actual reality. According to various stages of intelligence, one realizes the presence of the Supreme in everything through the manifestations of His energy. The entire world is permeated by the three guëas, and one can understand His presence according to one's modes of material nature."
