    "translation": "When Ajämila chewed food and ate it, he called the child to chew and eat, and when he drank he called the child to drink also. Always engaged in taking care of the child and calling his name, Näräyaëa, Ajämila could not understand that his own time was now exhausted and that death was upon him.",

Although this man completely forgot Näräyaëa, he was calling his child, saying, \"Näräyaëa, please come eat this food. Näräyaëa, please come drink this milk.\" Somehow or other, therefore, he was attached to the name Näräyaëa. This is called ajïäta-sukåti. Although calling for his son, he was unknowingly chanting the name of Näräyaëa, and the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so transcendentally powerful that his chanting was being counted and recorded."
