This system is still present in India; in a rigid brähmaëa's house, there is näräyaëa-sevä, worship of Näräyaëa. Therefore, although the contaminated Ajämila was calling for his son, by concentrating his mind on the holy name of Näräyaëa he remembered the Näräyaëa he had very faithfully worshiped in his youth."
