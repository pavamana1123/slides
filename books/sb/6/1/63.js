    "translation": "In the same way that the sun and moon are eclipsed by a low planet, the brähmaëa lost all his good sense. Taking advantage of this situation, he always thought of the prostitute, and within a short time he took her as a servant in his house and abandoned all the regulative principles of a brähmaëa.",

            "content": "By speaking this verse, Çukadeva Gosvämé wants to impress upon the mind of the reader that Ajämila's exalted position as a brähmaëa was vanquished by his association with the prostitute, so much so that he forgot all his brahminical activities. Nevertheless, at the end of his life, by chanting the four syllables of the name Näräyaëa, he was saved from the gravest danger of falling down. Svalpam apy asya dharmasya träyate mahato bhayät: even a little devotional service can save one from the greatest danger. Devotional service, which begins with chanting of the holy name of the Lord, is so powerful that even if one falls down from the exalted position of a brähmaëa through sexual indulgence, he can be saved from all calamities if he somehow or other chants the holy name of the Lord. This is the extraordinary power of the Lord's holy name. Therefore in Bhagavad-gétä it is advised that one not forget the chanting of the holy name even for a moment (satataà kértayanto mäà yatantaç ca dåòha-vratäù ). There are so many dangers in this material world that one may fall down from an exalted position at any time. Yet if one keeps himself always pure and steady by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, he will be safe without a doubt."
