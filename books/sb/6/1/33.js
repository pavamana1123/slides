A self-realized person knows that he is not the body but a spiritual soul (ahaà brahmäsmi). At the present moment practically everyone is unaware of this fact, but one who understands this has attained perfection and is therefore called siddha. When one understands that the soul is part and parcel of the supreme soul and one thus engages in the devotional service of the supreme soul, one becomes siddha-sat-tama. One is then eligible to live in the Vaikuëöha planets or Kåñëaloka. The word siddha-sattama, therefore, refers to a liberated, pure devotee."

            "content": "Since the Yamadütas are servants of Yamaräja, who is also one of the siddha-sattamas, they knew that a siddha-sattama is above the demigods and sub-demigods and, indeed, above all the living entities within this material world. The Yamadütas therefore inquired why the Viñëudütas were present where a sinful man was going to die."

            "content": "It should also be noted that Ajämila was not yet dead, for the Yamadütas were trying to snatch the soul from his heart. They could not take the soul, however, and therefore Ajämila was not yet dead. This will be revealed in later verses. Ajämila was simply in an unconscious state when the argument was in progress between the Yamadütas and the Viñëudütas. The conclusion of the argument was to be a decision regarding who would claim the soul of Ajämila."
