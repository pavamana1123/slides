    "translation": "My dear King, if a diseased person eats the pure, uncontaminated food prescribed by a physician, he is gradually cured, and the infection of disease can no longer touch him. Similarly, if one follows the regulative principles of knowledge, he gradually progresses toward liberation from material contamination.",

Therefore the platform of jïäna, speculative knowledge, is better than the platform of karma, fruitive action. There is every chance of falling from the platform of karma to hellish conditions, but on the platform of jïäna one is saved from hellish life, although one is still not completely free from infection. The difficulty is that on the platform of jïäna one thinks that he has been liberated and has become Näräyaëa, or Bhagavän. This is another phase of ignorance."

Therefore even if one rises to brahma jïäna, understanding of Brahman, one nevertheless falls down because of not taking shelter of the lotus feet of Kåñëa. Nonetheless, jïänés at least know what is sinful and what is pious, and they very cautiously act according to the injunctions of the çästras."
