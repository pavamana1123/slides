    "translation": "The order carriers of Yamaräja said: Your eyes are just like the petals of lotus flowers. Dressed in yellow silken garments, decorated with garlands of lotuses, and wearing very attractive helmets on your heads and earrings on your ears, you all appear fresh and youthful. Your four long arms are decorated with bows and quivers of arrows and with swords, clubs, conchshells, discs and lotus flowers. Your effulgence has dissipated the darkness of this place with extraordinary illumination. Now, sirs, why are you obstructing us?",

            "content": "Before even being introduced to a foreigner, one becomes acquainted with him through his dress, bodily features and behavior and can thus understand his position. Therefore when the Yamadütas saw the Viñëudütas for the first time, they were surprised. They said, \"By your bodily features you appear to be very exalted gentlemen, and you have such celestial power that you have dissipated the darkness of this material world with your own effulgences. Why then should you endeavor to stop us from executing our duty?\" It will be explained that the Yamadütas, the order carriers of Yamaräja, mistakenly considered Ajämila sinful. They did not know that although he was sinful throughout his entire life, he was purified by constantly chanting the holy name of Näräyaëa. In other words, unless one is a Vaiñëava, one cannot understand the activities of a Vaiñëava."

            "content": "The dress and bodily features of the residents of Vaikuëöhaloka are properly described in these verses. The residents of Vaikuëöha, who are decorated with garlands and yellow silken garments, have four arms holding various weapons. Thus they conspicuously resemble Lord Viñëu. They have the same bodily features as Näräyaëa because they have attained the liberation of särüpya, but they nevertheless act as servants. All the residents of Vaikuëöhaloka know perfectly well that their master is Näräyaëa, or Kåñëa, and that they are all His servants. They are all self-realized souls who are nitya-mukta, everlastingly liberated. Although they could conceivably declare themselves Näräyaëa or Viñëu, they never do so; they always remain Kåñëa conscious and serve the Lord faithfully. Such is the atmosphere of Vaikuëöhaloka. Similarly, one who learns the faithful service of Lord Kåñëa through the Kåñëa consciousness movement will always remain in Vaikuëöhaloka and have nothing to do with the material world."
