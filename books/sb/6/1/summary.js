Çukadeva Gosvämé, the speaker of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, has already described creation, subsequent creation and the planetary systems in the Third, Fourth and Fifth Cantos. Now, in this Sixth Canto, which consists of nineteen chapters, he will describe poñaëa, or protection by the Lord."

            "content": "The first chapter relates the history of Ajämila, who was considered a greatly sinful man, but was liberated when four order carriers of Viñëu came to rescue him from the hands of the order carriers of Yamaräja. A full description of how he was liberated, having been relieved of the reactions of his sinful life, is given in this chapter. Sinful activities are painful both in this life and in the next. We should know for certain that the cause of all painful life is sinful action. On the path of fruitive work one certainly commits sinful activities, and therefore according to the considerations of karma-käëòa, different types of atonement are recommended. Such methods of atonement, however, do not free one from ignorance, which is the root of sinful life. Consequently one is prone to commit sinful activities even after atonement, which is therefore very inadequate for purification. On the path of speculative knowledge one becomes free from sinful life by understanding things as they are. Therefore the acquirement of speculative knowledge is also considered a method of atonement. While performing fruitive activities one can become free from the actions of sinful life through austerity, penance, celibacy, control of the mind and senses, truthfulness and the practice of mystic yoga. By awakening knowledge one may also neutralize sinful reactions. Neither of these methods, however, can free one from the tendency to commit sinful activities."

            "content": "By bhakti-yoga one can completely avoid the tendency for sinful life; other methods are not very feasible. Therefore the Vedic literature concludes that devotional service is more important than the methods of karma-käëòa and jïäna-käëòa. Only the path of devotional service is auspicious for everyone. Fruitive activities and speculative knowledge cannot independently liberate anyone, but devotional service, independent of karma and jïäna, is so potent that one who has fixed his mind at the lotus feet of Kåñëa is guaranteed not to meet the Yamadütas, the order carriers of Yamaräja, even in dreams."

            "content": "To prove the strength of devotional service, Çukadeva Gosvämé described the history of Ajämila. Ajämila was a resident of Känyakubja (the modern Kanauj). He was trained by his parents to become a perfect brähmaëa by studying the Vedas and following the regulative principles, but because of his past, this youthful brähmaëa was somehow attracted by a prostitute, and because of her association he became most fallen and abandoned all regulative principles. Ajämila begot in the womb of the prostitute ten sons, the last of whom was called Näräyaëa. At the time of Ajämila's death, when the order carriers of Yamaräja came to take him, he loudly called the name Näräyaëa in fear because he was attached to his youngest son. Thus he remembered the original Näräyaëa, Lord Viñëu. Although he did not chant the holy name of Näräyaëa completely offenselessly, it acted nevertheless. As soon as he chanted the holy name of Näräyaëa, the order carriers of Lord Viñëu immediately appeared on the scene. A discussion ensued between the order carriers of Lord Viñëu and those of Yamaräja, and by hearing that discussion Ajämila was liberated. He could then understand the bad effect of fruitive activities and could also understand how exalted is the process of devotional service."
