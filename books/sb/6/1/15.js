Similarly, because the root of sinful desire is not destroyed in the heart of a person who is cultivating knowledge but who has no taste for devotional service, there is a possibility that his sinful desires will reappear.

They may fall down and become implicated in fruitive activities. If one becomes attached to devotional service, however, his desires for material enjoyment are automatically vanquished without separate endeavor. Bhaktiù pareçänubhavo viraktir anyatra ca:  if one is advanced in Kåñëa consciousness, material activities, both sinful and pious, automatically become distasteful to him. That is the test of Kåñëa consciousness. Both pious and impious activities are actually due to ignorance because a living entity, as an eternal servant of Kåñëa, has no need to act for his personal sense gratification. Therefore as soon as one is reclaimed to the platform of devotional service, he relinquishes his attachment for pious and impious activities and is interested only in what will satisfy Kåñëa. This process of bhakti, devotional service to Kåñëa (väsudeva-paräyaëa), relieves one from the reactions of all activities."

The desire to commit sinful actions continues in their hearts due to ignorance. These sinful actions are divided into three categories—pätaka, mahä-pätaka and atipätaka—and also into two divisions; prärabdha and aprärabdha. Prärabdha refers to sinful reactions from which one is suffering at the present, and aprärabdha refers to sources of potential suffering. When the seeds (béja) of sinful reactions have not yet fructified, the reactions are called aprärabdha. These seeds of sinful action are unseen, but they are unlimited, and no one can trace when they were first planted. Because of prärabdha, sinful reactions that have already fructified, one is seen to have taken birth in a low family or to be suffering from other miseries."

These reactions generally exist in four phases. Some of them are ready to produce results immediately, some are in the form of seeds, some are unmanifested, and some are current. All such reactions are immediately nullified by devotional service. When devotional service is present in one's heart, desires to perform sinful activities have no place there. Sinful life is due to ignorance, which means forgetfulness of one's constitutional position as an eternal servant of God, but when one is fully Kåñëa conscious he realizes that he is God's eternal servant."

            "content": "In this regard, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé comments that bhakti may be divided into two divisions: (1) santatä, devotional service that continues incessantly with faith and love, and (2) kädäcitké, devotional service that does not continue incessantly but is sometimes awakened. Incessantly flowing devotional service (santatä) may also be divided into two categories: (1) service performed with slight attachment and (2) spontaneous devotional service. Intermittent devotional service (kädäcitké) may be divided into three categories: (1) rägäbhäsamayé, devotional service in which one is almost attached, (2) rägäbhäsa-çünya-svarüpa-bhütä, devotional service in which there is no spontaneous love but one likes the constitutional position of serving, and (3) äbhäsa-rüpä, a slight glimpse of devotional service. As for atonement, if one has caught even a slight glimpse of devotional service, all needs to undergo präyaçcitta, atonement, are superseded. Therefore atonement is certainly unnecessary when one has achieved spontaneous love and, above that, attachment with love, which are signs of increasing advancement in kädäcitké. Even in the stage of äbhäsa-rüpä bhakti, all the reactions of sinful life are uprooted and vanquished. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé expresses the opinion that the word kärtsnyena means that even if one has a desire to commit sinful actions, the roots of that desire are vanquished merely by äbhäsa-rüpä bhakti. The example of bhäskara, the sun, is most appropriate. The äbhäsa feature of bhakti is compared to twilight, and the accumulation of one's sinful activities is compared to fog. Since fog does not spread throughout the sky, the sun need do no more than merely manifest its first rays, and the fog immediately disappears. Similarly, if one has even a slight relationship with devotional service, all the fog of his sinful life is immediately vanquished."
