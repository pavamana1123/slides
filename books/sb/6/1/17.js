Mäyävädés generally allege that the bhakti path is for women and illiterates. This is a groundless accusation. The bhakti path is followed by the most learned scholars, such as the Gosvämés, Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu and Rämänujäcärya. These are the actual followers of the bhakti path. Regardless of whether or not one is educated or aristocratic, one must follow in their footsteps. Mahäjano yena gataù sa panthäù: :"

As confirmed here by the word sadhrécénaù, bhakti is the path that is appropriate, not the paths of karma-käëòa and jïäna-käëòa. Mäyävädés may be suçéläù sädhavaù (well-behaved saintly persons), but there is nevertheless some doubt about whether they are actually making progress, for they have not accepted the path of bhakti. On the other hand, those who follow the path of the äcäryas are suçéläù and sädhavaù, but furthermore their path is akuto-bhaya, which means free from fear. One should fearlessly follow the twelve mahäjanas and their line of disciplic succession and thus be liberated from the clutches of mäyä."
