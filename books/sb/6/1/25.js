            "content": "Here it is clearly mentioned that the child Näräyaëa was so young that he could not even speak or walk properly. Since the old man was very attached to the child, he enjoyed the child's activities, and because the child's name was Näräyaëa, the old man always chanted the holy name of Näräyaëa. Although he was referring to the small child and not to the original Näräyaëa, the name of Näräyaëa is so powerful that even by chanting his son's name he was becoming purified (harer näma harer näma harer nämaiva kevalam ), one is on the path of liberation. It is customary in Hindu society for parents to give their children names like Kåñëadäsa, Govinda däsa, Näräyaëa däsa and Våndävana däsa. Thus they chant the names Kåñëa, Govinda, Näräyaëa and Våndävana and get the chance to be purified."
