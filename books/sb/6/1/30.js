They did not consider why he was chanting. While chanting the name of Näräyaëa, Ajämila was actually thinking of his son, but simply because they heard Ajämila chanting the Lord's name, the order carriers of Lord Viñëu, the Viñëudütas, immediately came for Ajämila's protection. Hari-kértana is actually meant to glorify the holy name, form, pastimes and qualities of the Lord. Ajämila, however, did not glorify the form, qualities or paraphernalia of the Lord; he simply chanted the holy name. Nevertheless, that chanting was sufficient to cleanse him of all sinful activities. As soon as the Viñëudütas heard their master's name being chanted, they immediately came. In this regard Çréla Vijayadhvaja Tértha remarks: anena putra-sneham antareëa präcénädåñöa-baläd udbhütayä bhaktyä bhagavan-näma-saìkértanaà kåtam iti jïäyate. \"Ajämila chanted the name of Näräyaëa because of his excessive attachment to his son. Nevertheless, because of his past good fortune in having rendered devotional service to Näräyaëa, he apparently chanted the holy name in full devotional service and without offenses.\""
