    "translation": "My dear lord, you have described the dynasties and characteristics of King Priyavrata and King Uttänapäda. The Supreme Personality of Godhead created this material world with various universes, planetary systems, planets and stars, with varied lands, seas, oceans, mountains, rivers, gardens and trees, all with different characteristics. These are divided among this planet earth, the luminaries in the sky and the lower planetary systems. You have very clearly described these planets and the living entities who live on them.",

Atheists try to conceal the hand of God, which is present in every creation, but they cannot explain how all these creations could come into existence without a competent intelligence and almighty power behind them. Simply to imagine or speculate is a waste of time. In Bhagavad-gétä :"

Such a great soul is very rare.\" Väsudeva, Kåñëa, is the creator of everything, and His energy is displayed in various ways. As explained in Bhagavad-gétä , a combination of the material energy (bhümir äpo 'nalo väyuù) and the spiritual energy, the living entity, exists in every creation. Therefore the same principle, the combination of the supreme spirit and the material elements, is the cause of the cosmic manifestation."
