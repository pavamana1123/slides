    "translation": "My dear King, if a sinful person engages in the service of a bona fide devotee of the Lord and thus learns how to dedicate his life unto the lotus feet of Kåñëa, he can be completely purified. One cannot be purified merely by undergoing austerity, penance, brahmacarya and the other methods of atonement I have previously described.",

They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.\" Thus the symptom of a mahätmä is that he has no engagement other than service to Kåñëa. One must render service to a Vaiñëava in order to get freed from sinful reactions, revive one's original Kåñëa consciousness and be trained in how to love Kåñëa. This is the result of mahätma-sevä. Of course, if one engages in the service of a pure devotee, the reactions of one's sinful life are vanquished automatically. Devotional service is necessary not to drive away an insignificant stock of sins, but to awaken our dormant love for Kåñëa. As fog is vanquished at the first glimpse of sunlight, one's sinful reactions are automatically vanquished as soon as one begins serving a pure devotee; no separate endeavor is required."

A devotee is näräyaëa-paräyaëa, or väsudeva-paräyaëa, which means that the path of Väsudeva, or the devotional path, is his life and soul. Näräyaëa-paräù sarve na kutaçcana bibhyati . He does not protest, \"Oh, I am such a great devotee of Kåñëa. Why have I been put into this misery?\" Instead he thinks, \"This is Kåñëa's mercy.\" Such an attitude is possible for a devotee who engages in the service of Kåñëa's representative. This is the secret of success."
