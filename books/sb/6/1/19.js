Do not fear.\" This same principle is described here (sakån manaù kåñëa-padäravindayoù). If by studying Bhagavad-gétä one decides to surrender to Kåñëa, he is immediately freed from all sinful reactions. It is also significant that Çukadeva Gosvämé, having several times repeated the words väsudeva-paräyaëa and näräyaëa-paräyaëa, finally says kåñëa-padäravindayoù. Thus he indicates that Kåñëa is the origin of both Näräyaëa and Väsudeva. Even though Näräyaëa and Väsudeva are not different from Kåñëa, simply by surrendering to Kåñëa one fully surrenders to all His expansions, such as Näräyaëa, Väsudeva and Govinda. As Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä ). Therefore Kåñëa recommends to neophyte devotees that one should surrender unto Him only (mäm ekam). Because neophyte devotees cannot understand what the forms of Näräyaëa, Väsudeva and Govinda are, Kåñëa directly says, mäm ekam. Herein, this is also supported by the word kåñëa-padäravindayoù. Näräyaëa does not speak personally, but Kåñëa, or Väsudeva, does, as in Bhagavad-gétä for example. Therefore, to follow the direction of Bhagavad-gétä means to surrender unto Kåñëa, and to surrender in this way is the highest perfection of bhakti-yoga."

In this verse Çukadeva Gosvämé answers that a soul who has surrendered to Kåñëa certainly cannot go to naraka, hellish existence. To say nothing of going there, even in his dreams he does not see Yamaräja or his order carriers, who are able to take one there. In other words, if one wants to save himself from falling into naraka, hellish life, he should fully surrender to Kåñëa. The word sakåt is significant because it indicates that if one sincerely surrenders to Kåñëa once, he is saved even if by chance he falls down by committing sinful activities. Therefore Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä :"

Of course, one should not commit sinful activities on the strength of having surrendered to Kåñëa. However, even if one who has surrendered to Kåñëa happens to do something sinful because of his former habits, such sinful actions no longer have a destructive effect. Therefore one should adhere to the lotus feet of Kåñëa very tightly and serve Him under the direction of the spiritual master. Thus in all conditions one will be akuto-bhaya, free from fear."
