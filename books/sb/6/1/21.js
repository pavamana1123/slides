In India there is still a class of servants, called çüdras, whose maidservant wives are called çüdräëés. Sometimes people who are very lusty establish relationships with such maidservants and sweeping women, since in the higher statuses of society they cannot indulge in the habit of woman hunting, which is strictly prohibited by social convention. Ajämila, a qualified brähmaëa youth, lost all his brahminical qualities because of his association with a prostitute, but he was ultimately saved because he had begun the process of bhakti-yoga. Therefore in the previous verse, Çukadeva Gosvämé spoke of the person who has only once surrendered himself at the lotus feet of the Lord (manaù kåñëa-padäravindayoù) or has just begun the bhakti-yoga process. Bhakti-yoga begins with çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù , hearing and chanting of Lord Viñëu's names, as in the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Chanting is the beginning of bhakti-yoga. Therefore Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu declares:"

There is no other way.\" The process of chanting the holy name of the Lord is always superbly effective, but it is especially effective in this age of Kali. Its practical effectiveness will now be explained by Çukadeva Gosvämé through the history of Ajämila, who was freed from the hands of the Yamadütas simply because of chanting the holy name of Näräyaëa. Parékñit Mahäräja's original question was how to be freed from falling down into hell or into the hands of the Yamadütas. In reply, Çukadeva Gosvämé is citing this old historical example to convince Parékñit Mahäräja of the potency of bhakti-yoga, which begins simply with the chanting of the Lord's name. All the great authorities of bhakti-yoga recommend the devotional process beginning with the chanting of the holy name of Kåñëa (tan-näma-grahaëädibhiù)."
