Since Ajämila had not undergone atonement for his sinful acts, he was to be taken to Yamaräja to be purified. When a man commits murder he becomes sinful, and therefore he also must be killed; otherwise after death he must suffer many sinful reactions. Similarly, punishment by Yamaräja is a process of purification for the most abominable sinful persons. Therefore the Yamadütas requested the Viñëudütas not to obstruct their taking Ajämila to Yamaräja."
