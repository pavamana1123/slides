    "translation": "Sometimes one who is very alert so as not to commit sinful acts is victimized by sinful life again. I therefore consider this process of repeated sinning and atoning to be useless. It is like the bathing of an elephant, for an elephant cleanses itself by taking a full bath, but then throws dust over its head and body as soon as it returns to the land.",

In this way Çukadeva Gosvämé tested the intelligence of Mahäräja Parékñit, who passed the examination by refusing to accept this process as genuine. Now Parékñit Mahäräja is expecting another answer from his spiritual master, Çukadeva Gosvämé."
