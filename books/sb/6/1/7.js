For karma-käëòa there are eighty authorized scriptures, such as Manu-saàhitä, which are known as dharma-çästras. In these scriptures one is advised to counteract his sinful acts by performing other types of fruitive action. This was the path first recommended by Çukadeva Gosvämé to Mahäräja Parékñit, and actually it is a fact that one who does not take to devotional service must follow the decision of these scriptures by performing pious acts to counteract his impious acts. This is known as atonement."
