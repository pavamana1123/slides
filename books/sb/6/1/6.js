            "content": "In the  of the Fifth Canto, Çukadeva Gosvämé has explained that people who commit sinful acts are forced to enter hellish planets and suffer. Now Mahäräja Parékñit, being a devotee, is concerned with how this can be stopped. A Vaiñëava is para-duùkha-duùkhé; in other words, he has no personal troubles, but he is very unhappy to see others in trouble. Prahläda Mahäräja said, \"My Lord, I have no personal problems, for I have learned how to glorify Your transcendental qualities and thus enter a trance of ecstasy. I do have a problem, however, for I am simply thinking of these rascals and fools who are busy with mäyä-sukha, temporary happiness, without knowledge of devotional service unto You.\" This is the problem faced by a Vaiñëava. Because a Vaiñëava fully takes shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he personally has no problems, but because he is compassionate toward the fallen, conditioned souls, he is always thinking of plans to save them from their hellish life in this body and the next. Parékñit Mahäräja, therefore, anxiously wanted to know from Çukadeva Gosvämé how humanity can be saved from gliding down to hell. Çukadeva Gosvämé had already explained how people enter hellish life, and he could also explain how they could be saved from it. Intelligent men must take advantage of these instructions. Unfortunately, however, the entire world is lacking Kåñëa consciousness, and therefore people are suffering from the grossest ignorance and do not even believe in a life after this one. To convince them of their next life is very difficult because they have become almost mad in their pursuit of material enjoyment. Nevertheless, our duty, the duty of all sane men, is to save them. Mahäräja Parékñit is the representative of one who can save them."
