            "content": "The word pravayasaù indicates Ajämila's sinfulness because although he was eighty-eight years old, he had a very young child. According to Vedic culture, one should leave home as soon as he has reached fifty years of age; one should not live at home and go on producing children. Sex life is allowed for twenty-five years, between the ages of twenty-five and forty-five or, at the most, fifty. After that one should give up the habit of sex life and leave home as a vänaprastha and then properly take sannyäsa. Ajämila, however, because of his association with a prostitute, lost all brahminical culture and became most sinful, even in his so-called household life."
