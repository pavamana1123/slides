    "translation": "To concentrate the mind, one must observe a life of celibacy and not fall down. One must undergo the austerity of voluntarily giving up sense enjoyment. One must then control the mind and senses, give charity, be truthful, clean and nonviolent, follow the regulative principles and regularly chant the holy name of the Lord. Thus a sober and faithful person who knows the religious principles is temporarily purified of all sins performed with his body, words and mind. These sins are like the dried leaves of creepers beneath a bamboo tree, which may be burned by fire although their roots remain to grow again at the first opportunity.",

            "content": "Tapaù is explained in the småti-çästra as follows: manasaç cendriyäëäà ca aikägryaà paramaà tapaù. \"Complete control of the mind and senses and their complete concentration on one kind of activity is called tapaù.\" Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is teaching people how to concentrate the mind on devotional service. This is first-class tapaù. Brahmacarya, the life of celibacy, has eight aspects: one should not think of women, speak about sex life, dally with women, look lustfully at women, talk intimately with women or decide to engage in sexual intercourse, nor should one endeavor for sex life or engage in sex life. One should not even think of women or look at them, to say nothing of talking with them. This is called first-class brahmacarya. If a brahmacäré or sannyäsé talks with a woman in a secluded place, naturally there will be a possibility of sex life without anyone's knowledge. Therefore a complete brahmacäré practices just the opposite. If one is a perfect brahmacäré, he can very easily control the mind and senses, give charity, speak truthfully and so forth. To begin, however, one must control the tongue and the process of eating."

            "content": "In the bhakti-märga, the path of devotional service, one must strictly follow the regulative principles by first controlling the tongue (sevonmukhe hi jihvädau svayam eva sphuraty adaù (Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.2.234)). The tongue (jihvä) can be controlled if one chants the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, does not speak of any subjects other than those concerning Kåñëa and does not taste anything not offered to Kåñëa. If one can control the tongue in this way, brahmacarya and other purifying processes will automatically follow. It will be explained in the next verse that the path of devotional service is completely perfect and is therefore superior to the path of fruitive activities and the path of knowledge. Quoting from the Vedas, Çréla Véraräghava Äcärya explains that austerity involves observing fasts as fully as possible (tapasänäçakena). Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has also advised that atyähära, too much eating, is an impediment to advancement in spiritual life. Also, in Bhagavad-gétä  Kåñëa says:"
