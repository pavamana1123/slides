    "translation": "In the beginning this brähmaëa named Ajämila studied all the Vedic literatures. He was a reservoir of good character, good conduct and good qualities. Firmly established in executing all the Vedic injunctions, he was very mild and gentle, and he kept his mind and senses under control. Furthermore, he was always truthful, he knew how to chant the Vedic mantras, and he was also very pure. Ajämila was very respectful to his spiritual master, the fire-god, guests, and the elderly members of his household. Indeed, he was free from false prestige. He was upright, benevolent to all living entities, and well behaved. He would never speak nonsense or envy anyone.",

            "content": "The order carriers of Yamaräja, the Yamadütas, are explaining the factual position of piety and impiety and how a living entity is entangled in this material world. Describing the history of Ajämila's life, the Yamadütas relate that in the beginning he was a learned scholar of the Vedic literature. He was well behaved, neat and clean, and very kind to everyone. In fact, he had all good qualities. In other words, he was like a perfect brähmaëa. A brähmaëa is expected to be perfectly pious, to follow all the regulative principles and to have all good qualities. The symptoms of piety are explained in these verses. Çréla Véraräghava Äcärya comments that dhåta-vrata means dhåtaà vrataà stré-saìga-rähityätmaka-brahmacarya-rüpam. In other words, Ajämila followed the rules and regulations of celibacy as a perfect brahmacäré and was very softhearted, truthful, clean and pure. How he fell down in spite of all these qualities and thus came to be threatened with punishment by Yamaräja will be described in the following verses."
