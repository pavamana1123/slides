The servants of Yamaräja claimed to be carrying out his orders, and therefore the Viñëudütas very intelligently asked them to explain the symptoms of religious and irreligious principles. A Vaiñëava knows these principles perfectly well because he is well acquainted with the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

All devotees, especially preachers, must know the philosophy of Kåñëa consciousness so as not to be embarrassed and insulted when they preach."
