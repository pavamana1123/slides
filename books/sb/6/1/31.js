Because Ajämila had chanted the holy name of Näräyaëa, the Viñëudütas not only immediately arrived on the spot but also at once ordered the Yamadütas not to touch him. By speaking with resounding voices, the Viñëudütas threatened to punish the Yamadütas if they continued trying to snatch Ajämila's soul from his heart. The order carriers of Yamaräja have jurisdiction over all sinful living entities, but the messengers of Lord Viñëu, the Viñëudütas, are capable of punishing anyone, including Yamaräja, if he wrongs a Vaiñëava."

Similarly, we learn that the Supersoul, Lord Viñëu, is also situated within the heart (éçvaraù sarva-bhütänäà håd-deçe 'rjuna tiñöhati ). In the Upaniñads it is said that the Supersoul and the individual soul are living in the same tree of the body as two friendly birds. The Supersoul is said to be friendly because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so kind to the original soul that when the original soul transmigrates from one body to another, the Lord goes with him. Furthermore, according to the desire and karma of the individual soul, the Lord, through the agency of mäyä, creates another body for him."

The driver of the machine of the body is the individual soul, who is also its director or proprietor, but the supreme proprietor is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One's body is created through the agency of mäyä (karmaëä daiva-netreëa ). At the appropriate time, one's next body is immediately chosen, and both the individual soul and the Supersoul transfer to that particular bodily machine. This is the process of transmigration. During transmigration from one body to the next, the soul is taken away by the order carriers of Yamaräja and put into a particular type of hellish life (naraka) in order to become accustomed to the condition in which he will live in his next body."
