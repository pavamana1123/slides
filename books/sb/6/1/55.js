    "synonyms": "eñaù—this; prakåti-saìgena—because of association with the material nature; puruñasya—of the living entity; viparyayaù—a situation of forgetfulness or an awkward position; äsét—came to be; saù—that position; eva—indeed; na—not; cirät—taking a long time; éça-saìgät—from the association of the Supreme Lord; viléyate—is vanquished.",
    "translation": "Since the living entity is associated with material nature, he is in an awkward position, but if in the human form of life he is taught how to associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee, this position can be overcome.",

            "content": "The word prakåti means material nature, and puruña may also refer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one wants to continue his association with prakåti, the female energy of Kåñëa, and be separated from Kåñëa by the illusion that he is able to enjoy prakåti, he must continue in his conditional life. If he changes his consciousness, however, and associates with the supreme, original person (puruñaà çäçvatam), or with His associates, he can get out of the entanglement of material nature. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä )."
