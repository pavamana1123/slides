In this way all living entities are awarded different qualities, different names [such as brähmaëa, kñatriya and vaiçya], different duties according to the varëäçrama institution, and different forms. Thus Näräyaëa is the cause of the entire cosmic manifestation.",

He has multifarious energies, and therefore He is able to remain in His own abode and without endeavor supervise and manipulate the entire cosmic manifestation through the interaction of the three modes of material nature—sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa. These interactions create different forms, bodies, activities and changes, which all occur perfectly. Because the Lord is perfect, everything works as if He were directly supervising and taking part in it. Atheistic men, however, being covered by the three modes of material nature, cannot see Näräyaëa to be the supreme cause behind all activities. As Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä :"
