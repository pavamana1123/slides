            "content": "To take advantage of the methods of atonement, one must be at least somewhat devoted; otherwise there is no chance of one's being purified. It is clear from this verse that even those who take advantage of karma-käëòa and jïäna-käëòa, but are not at least slightly devoted cannot be purified simply by following these other paths. The word präyaçcittäni is plural in number to indicate both karma-käëòa and jïäna-käëòa. Narottama däsa Öhäkura therefore says, karma-käëòa, jïäna-käëòa, kevala viñera bhäëòa. Thus Narottama däsa Öhäkura compares the paths of karma-käëòa and jïäna-käëòa to pots of poison. Liquor and poison are in the same category. According to this verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam, a person who has heard a good deal about the path of devotional service, but who is not attached to it, who is not Kåñëa conscious, is like a pot of liquor. Such a person cannot be purified without at least a slight touch of devotional service."
