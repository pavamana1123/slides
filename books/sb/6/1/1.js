By following that path, one is certainly elevated gradually to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, from which one is promoted to the spiritual world along with Lord Brahmä. Thus one's repetition of birth and death in the material world ceases.",

Therefore he reminded his spiritual master, Çukadeva Gosvämé, about the nivåtti-märga, or path of liberation, which he had described in the Second Canto. Mahäräja Parékñit, who at the time of death was fortunate to have met Çukadeva Gosvämé, inquired from Çukadeva Gosvämé about the path of liberation at that crucial time. Çukadeva Gosvämé very much appreciated his question and congratulated him by saying:"

            "content": "Parékñit Mahäräja was astonished that the living entities in the conditional stage do not accept the path of liberation, devotional service, instead of suffering in so many hellish conditions. This is the symptom of a Vaiñëava. Väïchä-kalpa-tarubhyaç ca kåpä-sindhubhya eva ca: a Vaiñëava is an ocean of mercy. Para-duùkha-duùkhé: he is unhappy because of the unhappiness of others. Therefore Parékñit Mahäräja, being compassionate toward the conditioned souls suffering in hellish life, suggested that Çukadeva Gosvämé continue describing the path of liberation, which he had explained in the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The word asaàsåti is very important in this connection. Saàsåti refers to continuing on the path of birth and death. Asaàsåti, on the contrary, refers to nivåtti-märga, or the path of liberation, by which one's birth and death cease and one gradually progresses to Brahmaloka, unless one is a pure devotee who does not care about going to the higher planetary systems, in which case one immediately returns home, back to Godhead, by executing devotional service (tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti ). Parékñit Mahäräja, therefore, was very eager to hear from Çukadeva Gosvämé about the path of liberation for the conditioned soul."

            "content": "According to the opinion of the äcäryas, the word krama-yogopalabdhena indicates that by first performing karma-yoga and then jïäna-yoga and finally coming to the platform of bhakti-yoga, one can be liberated. Bhakti-yoga, however, is so powerful that it does not depend on karma-yoga or jïäna-yoga. Bhakti-yoga itself is so powerful that even an impious man with no assets in karma-yoga or an illiterate with no assets in jïäna-yoga can undoubtedly be elevated to the spiritual world if he simply adheres to bhakti-yoga. Mäm evaiñyasy asaàçayaù. Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä  that by the process of bhakti-yoga one undoubtedly goes back to Godhead, back home to the spiritual world. Yogés, however, instead of going directly to the spiritual world, sometimes want to see other planetary systems, and therefore they ascend to the planetary system where Lord Brahmä lives, as indicated here by the word brahmaëä. At the time of dissolution, Lord Brahmä, along with all the inhabitants of Brahmaloka, goes directly to the spiritual world. This is confirmed in the Vedas as follows:"
