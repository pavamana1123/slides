    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé, the son of Vedavyäsa, answered: My dear King, since acts meant to neutralize impious actions are also fruitive, they will not release one from the tendency to act fruitively. Persons who subject themselves to the rules and regulations of atonement are not at all intelligent. Indeed, they are in the mode of darkness. Unless one is freed from the mode of ignorance, trying to counteract one action through another is useless because this will not uproot one's desires. Thus even though one may superficially seem pious, he will undoubtedly be prone to act impiously. Therefore real atonement is enlightenment in perfect knowledge, Vedänta, by which one understands the Supreme Absolute Truth.",

Now Çukadeva Gosvämé is suggesting the platform of speculative knowledge. Progressing from karma-käëòa to jïäna-käëòa, he is proposing, präyaçcittaà vimarçanam: \"Real atonement is full knowledge.\" Vimarçana refers to the cultivation of speculative knowledge. In Bhagavad-gétä, karmés, who are lacking in knowledge, are compared to asses. Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä :"

Vimarçana, however, is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä , one attains real knowledge when he understands Kåñëa and surrenders unto Him (bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän mäà prapadyate). To become learned and free from material contamination, therefore, one should try to understand Kåñëa, for thus one is immediately liberated from all pious and impious activities and their reactions."
