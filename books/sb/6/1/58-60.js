    "translation": "Once this brähmaëa Ajämila, following the order of his father, went to the forest to collect fruit, flowers and two kinds of grass, called samit and kuça. On the way home, he came upon a çüdra, a very lusty, fourth-class man, who was shamelessly embracing and kissing a prostitute. The çüdra was smiling, singing and enjoying as if this were proper behavior. Both the çüdra and the prostitute were drunk. The prostitute's eyes were rolling in intoxication, and her dress had become loose. Such was the condition in which Ajämila saw them.",

            "content": "While traveling along the public way, Ajämila came upon a fourth-class man and a prostitute, who are vividly described here. Drunkenness was sometimes manifest even in bygone ages, although not very frequently. In this age of Kali, however, such sin is to be seen everywhere, for people all over the world have become shameless. Long ago, when he saw the scene of the drunken çüdra and the prostitute, Ajämila, who was a perfect brahmacäré, was affected. Nowadays such sin is visible in so many places, and we must consider the position of a brahmacäré student who sees such behavior. For such a brahmacäré to remain steady is very difficult unless he is extremely strong in following the regulative principles. Nevertheless, if one takes to Kåñëa consciousness very seriously, he can withstand the provocation created by sin. In our Kåñëa consciousness movement we prohibit illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. In Kali-yuga, a drunk, half-naked woman embracing a drunk man is a very common sight, especially in the Western countries, and restraining oneself after seeing such things is very difficult. Nevertheless, if by the grace of Kåñëa one adheres to the regulative principles and chants the Hare Kåñëa mantra, Kåñëa will certainly protect him. Indeed, Kåñëa says that His devotee is never vanquished (kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati ). Therefore all the disciples practicing Kåñëa consciousness should obediently follow the regulative principles and remain fixed in chanting the holy name of the Lord. Then there need be no fear. Otherwise one's position is very dangerous, especially in this Kali-yuga."
