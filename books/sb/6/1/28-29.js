    "translation": "Ajämila then saw three awkward persons with deformed bodily features, fierce, twisted faces, and hair standing erect on their bodies. With ropes in their hands, they had come to take him away to the abode of Yamaräja. When he saw them he was extremely bewildered, and because of attachment to his child, who was playing a short distance away, Ajämila began to call him loudly by his name. Thus with tears in his eyes he somehow or other chanted the holy name of Näräyaëa.",

Fortunately, even though he was referring to his son, Ajämila chanted the four syllables of the hari-näma Näräyaëa, and therefore the order carriers of Näräyaëa, the Viñëudütas, also immediately arrived there. Because Ajämila was extremely afraid of the ropes of Yamaräja, he chanted the Lord's name with tearful eyes. Actually, however, he never meant to chant the holy name of Näräyaëa; he meant to call his son."
