It is therefore said, tasmäd guruà prapadyeta jijïäsuù çreya uttamam:  \"One who is inquisitive to understand the highest goal and benefit of life must approach a bona fide spiritual master and surrender unto him.\" Only one who is actually eager to receive knowledge to eradicate the darkness of ignorance is eligible to approach a guru, or spiritual master. The guru should not be approached for material benefits. One should not approach a guru just to cure some disease or receive some miraculous benefit. This is not the way to approach the guru. Tad-vijïänärtham: one should approach the guru to understand the transcendental science of spiritual life. Unfortunately, in this age of Kali there are many bogus gurus who display magic to their disciples, and many foolish disciples want to see such magic for material benefits. These disciples are not interested in pursuing spiritual life to save themselves from the darkness of ignorance. It is said:"

One who enlightens his disciple and saves him from rotting in the darkness of ignorance in this material world is a true guru."
