    "translation": "My dear King, you are an advanced devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To be absorbed in lamentation for the loss of something material is unsuitable for a person like you. Therefore we have both come to relieve you from this false lamentation, which is due to your being merged in the darkness of ignorance. For those who are advanced in spiritual knowledge to be affected by material loss and gain is not at all desirable.",

            "content": "Several words in this verse are very important. The word mahä-puruña refers to advanced devotees and also to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mahä means \"the supreme,\" and puruña means \"person.\" One who always engages in the service of the Supreme Lord is called mahä-pauruñika. Çukadeva Gosvämé and Mahäräja Parékñit are sometimes addressed as mahä-pauruñika. A devotee should always aspire to engage in the service of advanced devotees. As Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura has sung:"

            "content": "A devotee should always aspire to live in the association of advanced devotees and engage in the service of the Lord through the paramparä system. One should serve the mission of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu through the instructions of the great Gosvämés of Våndävana. This is called täìdera caraëa sevi. While serving the lotus feet of the Gosvämés, one should live in the association of devotees (bhakta-sane väsa). This is the business of a devotee. A devotee should not aspire for material profit or lament for material loss. When Aìgirä Åñi and Närada saw that Mahäräja Citraketu, an advanced devotee, had fallen in the darkness of ignorance and was lamenting for the material body of his son, by their causeless mercy they came to advise him so that he could be saved from this ignorance."

            "content": "Another significant word is brahmaëya. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sometimes addressed by the prayer namo brahmaëya-deväya, which offers obeisances unto the Lord because He is served by the devotees. Therefore this verse states, brahmaëyo bhagavad-bhakto näväsäditum arhasi. This is the symptom of an advanced devotee. Brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä . For a devotee—an advanced, self-realized soul—there is no cause for material jubilation or lamentation. He is always transcendental to conditional life."
