Like the Ganges River, the Narmadä River also flows in the higher planetary systems. The battle between the demigods and the demons took place in the higher planets."

In one day of Brahmä there are fourteen Manus, who each live for seventy-one millenniums. The four yugas—Satya, Tretä, Dväpara and Kali—constitute one millennium. We are presently in the manvantara of Vaivasvata Manu, who is mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä (imaà vivasvate yogaà proktavän aham avyayam/ vivasvän manave präha ). We are now in the twenty-eighth millennium of Vaivasvata Manu, but this fight took place in the beginning of Vaivasvata Manu's first millennium. One can historically calculate how long ago the battle took place. Since each millennium consists of 4,300,000 years and we are now in the twenty-eighth millennium, some 120,400,000 years have passed since the battle took place on the bank of the River Narmadä."
