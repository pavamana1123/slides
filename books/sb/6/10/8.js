He left His householder life, leaving aside His eternal consort, whom even the denizens of heaven adore. He went into the forest to deliver the fallen souls, who are put into illusion by material energy.\" To accept sannyäsa means to commit civil suicide, but sannyäsa is compulsory, at least for every brähmaëa, every first-class human being. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu had a very young and beautiful wife and a very affectionate mother. Indeed, the affectionate dealings of His family members were so pleasing that even the demigods could not expect such happiness at home. Nevertheless, for the deliverance of all the fallen souls of the world, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu took sannyäsa and left home when He was only twenty-four years old. He lived a very strict life as a sannyäsé, refusing all bodily comforts. Similarly, His disciples the six Gosvämés were ministers who held exalted positions in society, but they also left everything to join the movement of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Çréniväsa Äcärya says:"

Accepting very humble lives as mendicants, wearing no more than loincloths and torn quilts (kaupéna-kantha). they lived in Våndävana and followed Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu's order to excavate Våndävana's lost glories."

The words bhüta-dayayä, mäyä-mågaà dayitayepsitam and déna-gaëeçakau karuëayä all convey the same sense. These are very significant words for those interested in elevating human society to a proper understanding of life. One should join the Kåñëa consciousness movement, following the examples of such great personalities as Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, the six Gosvämés and, before them, the great sage Dadhéci. Instead of wasting one's life for temporary bodily comforts, one should always be prepared to give up one's life for better causes. After all, the body will be destroyed. Therefore one should sacrifice it for the glory of distributing religious principles throughout the world."
