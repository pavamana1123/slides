It is usable only for a short time and may perish at any moment.

Of course, in human society there are many institutions to help others, but because philanthropists do not know how to help others, their propensity for philanthropy is ineffectual. They do not know the ultimate goal of life (çreya äcaraëam), which is to please the Supreme Lord. If all philanthropic and humanitarian activities were directed toward achieving the ultimate goal of life—to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead—they would all be perfect. Humanitarian work without Kåñëa is nothing. Kåñëa must be brought to the center of all our activities; otherwise no activity will have value."
