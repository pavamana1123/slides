    "translation": "Våträsura said: All living entities who have taken birth in this material world must die. Surely, no one in this world has found any means to be saved from death. Even providence has not provided a means to escape it. Under the circumstances, death being inevitable, if one can gain promotion to the higher planetary systems and be always celebrated here by dying a suitable death, what man will not accept such a glorious death?",

Similar advice was also given by Kåñëa to Arjuna. \"My dear Arjuna,\" the Lord said, \"do not desist from fighting. If you gain victory in the fight, you will enjoy a kingdom, and even if you die you will be elevated to the heavenly planets.\" Everyone should be ready to die while performing glorious deeds. A glorious person is not meant to meet death like cats and dogs."
