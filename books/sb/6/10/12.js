Of this there is no doubt.\" Of course, one must practice before one is overcome by death, but the perfect yogé, namely the devotee, dies in trance, thinking of Kåñëa. He does not feel his material body being separated from his soul; the soul is immediately transferred to the spiritual world. Tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti mäm eti:  the soul does not enter the womb of a material mother again, but is transferred back home, back to Godhead. This yoga, bhakti-yoga, is the highest yoga system, as explained by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä (6.47):"
