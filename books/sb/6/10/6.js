    "synonyms": "nünam—certainly; sva-artha-paraù—interested only in sense gratification in this life or the next; lokaù—materialistic people in general; na—not; veda—know; para-saìkaöam—the pain of others; yadi—if; veda—know; na—not; yäceta—would ask; na—no; iti—thus; na äha—does not say; yat—since; éçvaraù—able to give charity.",
    "translation": "Those who are too self-interested beg something from others, not knowing of others' pain. But if the beggar knew the difficulty of the giver, he would not ask for anything. Similarly, he who is able to give charity does not know the beggar's difficulty, for otherwise he would not refuse to give the beggar anything he might want as charity.",

Similarly, one who is able to give charity should not deny a beggar. These are the moral instructions of the çästra. Cäëakya Paëòita says, san-nimitte varaà tyägo vinäçe niyate sati: everything within this material world will be destroyed, and therefore one should use everything for good purposes. If one is advanced in knowledge, he must always be prepared to sacrifice anything for a better cause. At the present moment the entire world is in a dangerous position under the spell of a godless civilization. The Kåñëa consciousness movement needs many exalted, learned persons who will sacrifice their lives to revive God consciousness throughout the world. We therefore invite all men and women advanced in knowledge to join the Kåñëa consciousness movement and sacrifice their lives for the great cause of reviving the God consciousness of human society."
