    "translation": "When insignificant persons use rough words to cast false, angry accusations against saintly persons, their fruitless words do not disturb the great personalities. Similarly, all the efforts of the demons against the demigods, who were favorably situated under the protection of Kåñëa, were futile.",

Similarly, accusations made by demoniac persons against devotees of Kåñëa cannot have any effect. The demigods are devotees of Lord Kåñëa, and therefore the curses of the demons were futile."
