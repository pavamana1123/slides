Charged with the exalted power of Dadhéci Muni and enlightened by the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Indra rode on the back of his carrier, Airävata, surrounded by all the demigods, while all the great sages offered him praise. Thus he shone very beautifully, pleasing the three worlds as he rode off to kill Våträsura.",
