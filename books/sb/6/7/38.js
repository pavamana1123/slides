            "content": "The word samädhinä is very important. Samädhi means complete absorption with an undiverted mind. Viçvarüpa, who was a most learned brähmaëa, not only accepted the request of the demigods, but took their request seriously and performed the activities of priesthood with an undiverted mind. In other words, he accepted the priesthood not for material gain, but to profit the demigods. Such is the duty of a priest. The word puraù means \"family,\" and hita means \"benefit.\" Thus the word purohita indicates that the priest is the well-wisher of the family. Another meaning of the word puraù is \"first.\" A priest's first duty is to see that his disciples benefit spiritually and materially by all means. Then he is satisfied. A priest should never be interested in performing Vedic rituals for his personal benefit."
