    "translation": "Çré Viçvarüpa said: O demigods, although the acceptance of priesthood is decried as causing the loss of previously acquired brahminical power, how can someone like me refuse to accept your personal request? You are all exalted commanders of the entire universe. I am your disciple and must take many lessons from you. Therefore I cannot refuse you. I must agree for my own benefit.",

The words yajana and yäjana mean that a brähmaëa becomes the priest of the populace for the sake of their elevation. One who accepts the post of spiritual master neutralizes the sinful reactions of the yajamäna, the one on whose behalf he performs yajïa. Thus the results of the pious acts previously performed by the priest or spiritual master are diminished. Therefore priesthood is not accepted by learned brähmaëas. Nevertheless, the greatly learned brähmaëa Viçvarüpa became the priest of the demigods because of his profound respect for them."
