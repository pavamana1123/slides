The reason, as stated here, was that they had offended their spiritual master. Their impudent disrespect of their spiritual master was the cause of their defeat by the demons. As stated in the çästras, when one disrespects a respectable superior, one loses his longevity and the results of his pious activities, and in this way one is degraded."
