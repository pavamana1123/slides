    "translation": "Lord Brahmä said: O best of the demigods, unfortunately, because of madness resulting from your material opulence, you failed to receive Båhaspati properly when he came to your assembly. Because he is aware of the Supreme Brahman and fully in control of his senses, he is the best of the brähmaëas. Therefore it is very astonishing that you have acted impudently toward him.",

            "content": "Lord Brahmä recognized the brahminical qualifications of Båhaspati, who was the spiritual master of the demigods because of his awareness of the Supreme Brahman. Båhaspati was very much in control of his senses and mind, and therefore he was a most qualified brähmaëa. Lord Brahmä chastised the demigods for not properly respecting this brähmaëa, who was their guru. Lord Brahmä wanted to impress upon the demigods that one's guru should not be disrespected under any circumstances. When Båhaspati entered the assembly of the demigods, they and their king, Indra, took him for granted. Since he came every day, they thought, they did not need to show him special respect. As it is said, familiarity breeds contempt. Being very much displeased, Båhaspati immediately left Indra's palace. Thus all the demigods, headed by Indra, became offenders at the lotus feet of Båhaspati, and Lord Brahmä, being aware of this, condemned their neglect. In a song we sing every day, Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, cakñu-däna dila yei, janme janme prabhu sei: the guru gives spiritual insight to the disciple, and therefore the guru should be considered his master, life after life. Under no circumstances should the guru be disrespected, but the demigods, being puffed up by their material possessions, were disrespectful to their guru. Therefore Çrémad-Bhägavatam  advises, äcäryaà mäà vijänéyän nävamanyeta karhicit/ na martya-buddhyäsüyeta: the äcärya should always be offered respectful obeisances; one should never envy the äcärya, considering him an ordinary human being."
