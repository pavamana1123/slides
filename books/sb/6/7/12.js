Therefore, both individually and collectively, they try to enjoy so-called material comforts, and they become addicted to wine and women. The men produced in such a society are less than fourth class. They are the unwanted population known as varëa-saìkara, and as stated in Bhagavad-gétä, an increase of varëa-saìkara population creates a hellish society. This is the society in which Americans now find themselves."

If the American people are serious about curbing the degraded criminal life of their nation, they must take to the Kåñëa consciousness movement and try to create the kind of human society advised in Bhagavad-gétä (cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù ). They must divide their society into first-class men, second-class men, third-class men and fourth-class men. Since they are now creating only men who are less than fourth class, how can they avoid the dangers of a criminal society? Long, long ago, Lord Indra regretted his disrespect to his spiritual master, Båhaspati. Similarly, it is advised that the American people regret their mistaken advancement in civilization. They should take advice from the spiritual master, the representative of Kåñëa. If they do so, they will be happy, and theirs will be an ideal nation to lead the entire world."
