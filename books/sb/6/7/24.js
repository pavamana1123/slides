    "translation": "Because of their firm determination to follow the instructions of Çukräcärya, his disciples, the demons, are now unconcerned about the demigods. In fact, kings or others who have determined faith in the mercy of brähmaëas, cows and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and who always worship these three are always strong in their position.",

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is go-brähmaëa-hitäya ca: He is always very kind to cows and brähmaëas. Therefore one who worships Govinda must satisfy Him by worshiping the brähmaëas and cows. If a government worships the brähmaëas, the cows and Kåñëa, Govinda, it is never defeated anywhere; otherwise it must always be defeated and condemned everywhere. At the present moment, all over the world, governments have no respect for brähmaëas, cows and Govinda, and consequently there are chaotic conditions all over the world. In summary, although the demigods were very powerful in material opulence, the demons defeated them in battle because the demigods had behaved disrespectfully toward a brähmaëa, Båhaspati, who was their spiritual master."
