            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says in this regard that when a president or king is sitting on his throne, he does not need to show respect to everyone who comes within his assembly, but he must show respect to superiors like his spiritual master, brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas. There are many examples of how he should act. When Lord Kåñëa was sitting on His throne and Närada fortunately entered His assembly, even Lord Kåñëa immediately stood up with His officers and ministers to offer respectful obeisances to Närada. Närada knew that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Kåñëa knew that Närada was His devotee, but although Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord and Närada is the Lord's devotee, the Lord observed the religious etiquette. Since Närada was a brahmacäré, a brähmaëa and an exalted devotee, even Kåñëa, while acting as a king, offered His respectful obeisances unto Närada. Such is the conduct visible in the Vedic civilization. A civilization in which the people do not know how the representative of Närada and Kåñëa should be respected, how society should be formed and how one should advance in Kåñëa consciousness—a society concerned only with manufacturing new cars and new skyscrapers every year and then breaking them to pieces and making new ones—may be technologically advanced, but it is not a human civilization. A human civilization is advanced when its people follow the cätur-varëya system, the system of four orders of life. There must be ideal, first-class men to act as advisors, second-class men to act as administrators, third-class men to produce food and protect cows, and fourth-class men who obey the three higher classes of society. One who does not follow the standard system of society should be considered a fifth-class man. A society without Vedic laws and regulations will not be very helpful to humanity. As stated in this verse, dharmaà te na paraà viduù: such a society does not know the aim of life and the highest principle of religion."
