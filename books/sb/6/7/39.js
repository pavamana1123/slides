    "translation": "The opulence of the demons, who are generally known as the enemies of the demigods, was protected by the talents and tactics of Çukräcärya, but Viçvarüpa, who was most powerful, composed a protective prayer known as the Näräyaëa-kavaca. By this intelligent mantra, he took away the opulence of the demons and gave it to Mahendra, the King of heaven.",

Sometimes the demons are also devotees of Lord Brahmä. For example, Hiraëyakaçipu was a devotee of Lord Brahmä, Rävaëa was a devotee of Lord Çiva, and Mahiñäsura was a devotee of Goddess Durgä. The demigods are devotees of Lord Viñëu (viñëu-bhaktaù småto daiva), whereas the demons (äsuras tad-viparyayaù) are always against the viñëu-bhaktas, or Vaiñëavas. To oppose the Vaiñëavas, the demons become devotees of Lord Çiva, Lord Brahmä, Kälé, Durgä, and so on. In the days of yore, many long years ago, there was animosity between the devas and the asuras, and the same spirit still continues, for the devotees of Lord Çiva and Goddess Durgä are always envious of Vaiñëavas, who are devotees of Lord Viñëu. This strain between the devotees of Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu has always existed. In the higher planetary systems, fights between the demons and the demigods continue for a long, long time."
