    "translation": "Saintly persons [sädhus] think of Kåñëa twenty-four hours a day. They have no other interest. Why should people neglect the association of such exalted spiritual personalities and try to associate with materialists, taking shelter of nondevotees, most of whom are proud and rich?",

He has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime.\"  A sädhu is suhådaù sarva-dehinäm, the friend of everyone. Why then should the rich, instead of associating with sädhus, waste their valuable time in association with other rich men who are averse to spiritual life? Both the poor man and the rich man can take advantage of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, and here it is advised that everyone do so. There is no profit in avoiding the association of the members of the Kåñëa consciousness movement. Narottama däsa Öhäkura has said:"

The word asat refers to an avaiñëava, one who is not a devotee of Kåñëa, and sat refers to a Vaiñëava, Kåñëa's devotee. One should always seek the association of Vaiñëavas and not spoil one's life by mixing with avaiñëavas. In Bhagavad-gétä , the distinction between Vaiñëava and avaiñëava is enunciated:"
