The sädhus, saintly persons or devotees, are always harassed by nondevotees, and Kåñëa appears in His incarnations to give them relief. This is His first concern. If we study the history of Kåñëa's life, we shall find that for most of His life He predominantly engaged in killing demons one after another."
