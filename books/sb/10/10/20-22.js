    "translation": "These two young men, Nalaküvara and Maëigréva, are by fortune the sons of the great demigod Kuvera, but because of false prestige and madness after drinking liquor, they are so fallen that they are naked but cannot understand that they are. Therefore, because they are living like trees (for trees are naked but are not conscious), these two young men should receive the bodies of trees. This will be proper punishment. Nonetheless, after they become trees and until they are released, by my mercy they will have remembrance of their past sinful activities. Moreover, by my special favor, after the expiry of one hundred years by the measurement of the demigods, they will be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva, face to face, and thus revive their real position as devotees.",

But Närada Muni wanted the consciousness of Nalaküvara and Maëigréva to continue, so that even after being released from the life of trees, they would not forget the circumstances under which they had been punished. Therefore, to bestow upon them special favor, Närada Muni arranged things in such a way that after being released, they would be able to see Kåñëa in Våndävana and thus revive their dormant bhakti."

Although the demigods in the upper planetary system are attached to material enjoyment, they are all devotees, and therefore they are called demigods. There are two kinds of persons, namely the devas and the asuras. Asuras forget their relationship with Kåñëa (äsuraà bhävam äçritäù), whereas the devas do not forget."

One who is in direct touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotional service remains pure, uncontaminated by material desires (anyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11])."

But pure bhakti does not depend on karma, jïäna or yoga, for it simply consists of loving affairs. The liberation of the bhakta, therefore, which is called not just mukti but vimukti, surpasses the five other kinds of liberation-säyujya, särüpya, sälokya, särñöi and sämépya. A pure devotee always engages in pure service (änukülyena kåñëänuçélanaà bhaktir uttamä ). Taking birth in the upper planetary system as a demigod is a chance to become a further purified devotee and go back home, back to Godhead. Närada Muni indirectly gave Maëigréva and Nalaküvara the greatest opportunity by his so-called curse."
