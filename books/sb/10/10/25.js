            "content": "Nalaküvara and Maëigréva actually had nothing to do with devotional service or seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face, for this is not an ordinary opportunity. It is not that because one is very rich or learned or was born in an aristocratic family one will be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. This is impossible. But in this case, because Närada Muni desired that Nalaküvara and Maëigréva see Väsudeva face to face, the Supreme Personality of Godhead wanted to fulfill the words of His very dear devotee Närada Muni. If one seeks the favor of a devotee instead of directly asking favors from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is very easily successful. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has therefore recommended: vaiñëava öhäkura tomära kukkura bhuliyä jänaha more, kåñëa se tomära kåñëa dite pära. One should desire to become like a dog in strictly following a devotee. Kåñëa is in the hand of a devotee. Adurlabham ätma-bhaktau. Thus without the favor of a devotee, one cannot directly approach Kåñëa, what to speak of engaging in His service. Narottama däsa Öhäkura therefore sings, chäòiyä vaiñëava-sevä nistära päyeche kebä: unless one becomes a servant of a pure devotee, one cannot be delivered from the material condition of life. In our Gauòéya Vaiñëava society, following in the footsteps of Rüpa Gosvämé, our first business is to seek shelter of a bona fide spiritual master (ädau gurv-äçrayaù)."
