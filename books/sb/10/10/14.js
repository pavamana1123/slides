The laws of nature act accordingly. If one has killed an animal, one must himself be killed by that same animal. This is called mäàsa. Mäm means \"me,\" and sa means \"he.\" As I am eating an animal, that animal will have the opportunity to eat me. In every state, therefore, it is ordinarily the custom that if a person commits murder he is hanged."
