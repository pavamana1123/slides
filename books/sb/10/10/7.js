Thus the curse was ultimately auspicious and brilliant. One has to judge what kind of curse Närada placed upon them. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura gives herein a good example. When a father finds his child deeply asleep but the child has to take some medicine to cure some disease, the father pinches the child so that the child will get up and take the medicine. In a similar way, Närada Muni cursed Nalaküvara and Maëigréva in order to cure their disease of material blindness."
