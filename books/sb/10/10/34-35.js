These bodies of Yours, therefore, are not made of material elements, but are incarnations of Your Supreme Personality. You are the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, who have now appeared, with full potency, for the benefit of all living entities within this material world.",

Unfortunate, less intelligent persons, bereft of devotional service, cannot understand the Lord's activities, and therefore such persons describe these activities as kalpanä-mythology or imagination-because they are rascals and the lowest of men (na mäà duñkåtino müòhäù prapadyante narädhamäù ). Such men cannot understand that the events described by Vyäsadeva in the puräëas and other çästras are not fictitious or imaginary, but factual."

            "content": "Kåñëa, in His full, unlimited potency, here shows that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for although the two trees were so large and sturdy that even many elephants could not move them, Kåñëa, as a child, exhibited such extraordinary strength that they fell down with a great sound. From the very beginning, by killing Pütanä, Çakaöäsura and Tåëävartäsura, by causing the trees to fall, and by showing the entire universe within His mouth, Kåñëa proved that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The lowest of men (müòhas), because of sinful activities, cannot understand this, but devotees can accept it without a doubt. Thus the position of a devotee is different from that of a nondevotee."
