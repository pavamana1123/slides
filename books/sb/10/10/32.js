Therefore, how can those who are created-that is, those entrapped in bodies created of material elements—understand Kåñëa perfectly? This is not possible. But, sevonmukhe hi jihvädau svayam eva sphuraty adaù: Kåñëa reveals Himself to those engaged in devotional service. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä  by the Lord Himself: bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti. Even the descriptions of Kåñëa in Çrémad-Bhägavatam are sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men with a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore, the best course by which to know Him is to engage oneself in pure devotional activities. The more one advances in devotional activities, the more one can understand Him as He is. If from the material platform one could understand Kåñëa, then, since Kåñëa is everything (sarvaà khalv idaà brahma), one could understand Kåñëa by seeing anything within this material world. But that is not possible."
