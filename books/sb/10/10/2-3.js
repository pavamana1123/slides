    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: O King Parékñit, because the two sons of Kuvera had been elevated to the association of Lord Çiva, of which they were very much proud, they were allowed to wander in a garden attached to Kailäsa Hill, on the bank of the Mandäkiné River. Taking advantage of this, they used to drink a kind of liquor called Väruëé. Accompanied by women singing after them, they would wander in that garden of flowers, their eyes always rolling in intoxication.",

Apart from Lord Çiva, if one is a devotee of any other demigod, one receives some material advantages. Foolish people, therefore, become devotees of demigods. This has been pointed out and criticized by Lord Kåñëa in Bhagavad-gétä , where Lord Kåñëa says:"

Thus there is no difficulty in finding out who is a third-class or fourth-class man, for one's position can be understood simply by this crucial test: is he or is he not a devotee of Kåñëa?"
