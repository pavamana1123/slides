    "translation": "When one is face to face with the sun, there is no longer darkness for one's eyes. Similarly, when one is face to face with a sädhu, a devotee, who is fully determined and surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one will no longer be subject to material bondage.",

            "content": "If by chance one meets a sädhu, a devotee, one's life is immediately successful, and one is freed from material bondage. It may be argued that whereas someone may receive a sädhu with great respect, someone else may not receive a sädhu with such respect. A sädhu, however, is always equipoised toward everyone. Because of being a pure devotee, a sädhu is always ready to deliver Kåñëa consciousness without discrimination. As soon as one sees a sädhu, one naturally becomes free. Nonetheless, persons who are too much offensive, who commit vaiñëava-aparädhas, or offenses to a sädhu, will have to take some time before being rectified. This is also indicated herein."
