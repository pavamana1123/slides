But this was not tamaù, for Närada Muni, in full knowledge of what was for the good of the two brothers, wisely thought of how to cure them. Vaiñëavas are good physicians. They know how to protect a person from material disease. Thus they are never in tamo-guëa. Sa guëän samatétyaitän brahma-bhüyäya kalpate . Vaiñëavas are always situated on the transcendental platform, the Brahman platform. They cannot be subject to mistakes or the influence of the modes of material nature. Whatever they do, after full consideration, is meant just to lead everyone back home, back to Godhead."
