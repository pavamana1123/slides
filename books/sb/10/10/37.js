According to this verse of Bhagavad-gétä ), one can then understand who is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, many pseudo incarnations are advertised simply for having exhibited some magical performances, but except for persons who are servants of Närada and other servants of Kåñëa, no one can understand who is God and who is not. This is confirmed by Narottama däsa Öhäkura. Chäòiyä vaiñëava-sevä nistära päyeche kebä: no one is delivered from the material conception of life unless favored by a Vaiñëava. Others can never understand, neither by speculation nor by any other bodily or mental gymnastics."
