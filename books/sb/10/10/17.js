    "synonyms": "daridrasya—of a person who is poverty-stricken; eva—indeed; yujyante—may easily associate; sädhavaù—saintly persons; sama-darçinaù—although sädhus are equal to everyone, to the poor and the rich, the poor man can take advantage of their association; sadbhiù—by the association of such saintly persons; kñiëoti—reduces; tam—the original cause of material suffering; tarñam—the desire for material enjoyment; tataù—thereafter; ärät—very soon; viçuddhyati—his material contamination is cleansed off.",
    "translation": "Saintly persons may freely associate with those who are poverty-stricken, but not with those who are rich. A poverty-stricken man, by association with saintly persons, very soon becomes uninterested in material desires, and the dirty things within the core of his heart are cleansed away.",

Sädhus, saintly persons, want to preach to both the poor and the rich, but the poor take more advantage of the sädhus' preaching than the rich do. A poor man receives sädhus very quickly, offers them obeisances, and tries to take advantage of their presence, whereas a rich man keeps a big greyhound dog at his door so that no one can enter his house. He posts a sign saying \"Beware of Dog\" and avoids the association of saintly persons, whereas a poor man keeps his door open for them and thus benefits by their association more than a rich man does. Because Närada Muni, in his previous life, was the poverty-stricken son of a maidservant, he got the association of saintly persons and later became the exalted Närada Muni. This was his actual experience. Therefore, he is now comparing the position of a poor man with that of a rich man."
