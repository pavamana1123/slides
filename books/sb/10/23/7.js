The boys expected the brähmaëas to know the Vedic injunction annasya kñuditaà pätram: \"Anyone who is hungry is a fit candidate for receiving food in charity.\" But if the brähmaëas would not recognize the authority of Kåñëa and Balaräma, their title dvija would be taken to mean merely \"born from two parents\" (dvi-from two, ja-born) rather than \"twice-born.\" When the brähmaëas did not respond to the cowherd boys' initial request, the boys addressed the brähmaëas, with a slight trace of sarcasm, as dharma-vit-tamäù, \"O best of the knowers of religion.\""
