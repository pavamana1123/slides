But they were afraid that Kaàsa would certainly kill them when his spies reported that they had gone to Kåñëa. The brähmaëas' wives were absorbed in ecstatic Kåñëa consciousness and thus went to Kåñëa anyway, just as the gopés, simply to dance with the Lord, traveled in the dead of night through a forest inhabited by wild animals. But the brähmaëas were not on such an advanced platform of Kåñëa consciousness and thus, overcome by fear of Kaàsa, could not see the Lord face to face."
