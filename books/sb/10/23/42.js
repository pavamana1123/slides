The husbands noted that the women, having perfected their transcendental attachment for Kåñëa, did not have even a trace of attachment left for home, husband, children and so forth. Therefore from that day on the husbands accepted those ladies as their worshipable spiritual masters and no longer thought of them as their wives or property."
