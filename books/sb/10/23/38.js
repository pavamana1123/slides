Rather, the brähmaëas deceived themselves, as indicated by the Sanskrit word nå-viòambayoù, which means that Kåñëa and Balaräma are bewildering for an ordinary human being who considers Them also to be human. Still, because the wives of the brähmaëas were great devotees of the Lord, the foolish brähmaëas received spiritual benefit and finally came to their senses."
