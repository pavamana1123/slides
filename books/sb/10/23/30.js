Consequently they always felt ecstatic love for Kåñëa and were indifferent to their household duties. Their husbands, seeing them as deviant, doubted them and avoided dealing with them as far as possible. Now the wives of the brähmaëas were ready to formally reject their so-called families and neighbors, and out of great agitation they were crying and placing their heads upon Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet, offering obeisances. In this way, with choking voices, they spoke the above verse. They begged that Lord Kåñëa bestow upon them the benediction that He be their only destination, that He, the chastiser of enemies, subdue all their enemies—those difficulties obstructing them from attaining the Lord.\""
