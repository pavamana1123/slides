But these brähmaëas ignored the boys, thinking Çré Kåñëa an ordinary human being. The boys returned disappointed, but the Lord sent them off again, advising them to ask the brähmaëas' wives for the food. These ladies had heard of Kåñëa's transcendental qualities and were very much attached to Him. Thus as soon as they learned He was nearby, they went to Him in great haste, bringing all four varieties of food. In this way they offered themselves to Çré Kåñëa."

He advised them that since they were housewives, their particular duty was to help their husbands perform sacrifices. He therefore instructed them to return to their homes."

On the other hand, these womenfolk, who have not undergone the purificatory processes of the brahminical class or performed any austerity or pious rituals, have through devotion for Kåñëa easily cut off the bondage of death."
