Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the reason Lord Kåñëa did not have the cowherd boys tell the brähmaëas' wives He was hungry is that He knew this would severely distress these devoted ladies. Simply out of affection for Lord Kåñëa, however, the wives would be happy to give all the food requested of them. They would not heed their husbands' prohibitions, since they resided within the Lord through their transcendental intelligence."
