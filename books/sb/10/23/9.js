    "translation": "The brähmaëas heard this supplication from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet they refused to pay heed. Indeed, they were full of petty desires and entangled in elaborate rituals. Though presuming themselves advanced in Vedic learning, they were actually inexperienced fools.",

Presently, throughout the world, people are madly pursuing material advancement and thus cannot hear the message of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa that is being broadcast through the missionary activities of the Kåñëa consciousness movement. Times have hardly changed, and proud, materialistic priests are still prevalent on the earth."
