The philosophy of Kåñëa consciousness is not a primitive polytheistic doctrine holding that human beings on the earth are gods. Rather, it is a science that traces the descent of authority from the Absolute Truth Himself, Çré Kåñëa. The authority and power of God naturally extend along with the extension of His creation, and on the earth the Lord's will and authority are represented by purified, enlightened men called brähmaëas."

In fact, this pastime exposes the pretentious position of so-called brähmaëas who are not faithful devotees of the Supreme Lord."
