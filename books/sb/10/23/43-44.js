    "translation": "These women have never undergone the purificatory rites of the twice-born classes, nor have they lived as brahmacärés in the äçrama of a spiritual master, nor have they executed austerities, speculated on the nature of the self, followed the formalities of cleanliness or engaged in pious rituals. Nevertheless, they have firm devotion for Lord Kåñëa, whose glories are chanted by the exalted hymns of the Vedas and who is the supreme master of all masters of mystic power. We, on the other hand, have no such devotion for the Lord, although we have executed all these processes.",

The brähmaëas were astonished at their wives' loving devotion for Lord Kåñëa, not realizing that this devotion had developed as a result of hearing and chanting about the Lord in the association of His pure devotees."
