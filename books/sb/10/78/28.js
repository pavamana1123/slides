Considering these points, He killed Romaharñaëa Süta simply by striking him with a kuça straw, which was nothing but a blade of grass. If someone questions how Lord Balaräma could kill Romaharñaëa Süta simply by striking him with a blade of kuça grass, the answer is given in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam by the use of the word prabhu (master). The Lord's position is always transcendental, and because He is omnipotent He can act as He likes without being obliged to follow the material laws and principles. Thus it was possible for Him to kill Romaharñaëa Süta simply by striking him with a blade of kuça grass."
