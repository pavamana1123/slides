    "translation": "Although he is a disciple of the divine sage Vyäsa and has thoroughly learned many scriptures from him, including the lawbooks of religious duties and the epic histories and Puräëas, all this study has not produced good qualities in him. Rather, his study of the scriptures is like an actor's studying his part, for he is not self-controlled or humble and vainly presumes himself a scholarly authority, though he has failed to conquer his own mind.",
