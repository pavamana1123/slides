Further, the word bandhu-rüpam indicates that Lord Kåñëa is actually everyone's true friend, and vyädhim indicates that Lord Kåñëa is the Supersoul, the object of meditation within the heart, who takes away our mental distress. Furthermore, the äcäryas translate the word hatvä as jïätvä; in other words, by knowing Kåñëa properly one can actually liberate all of one's friends."
