Dantavakra then insulted the Lord with harsh words and struck Him a terrific blow on the head. Without budging in the slightest, Lord Kåñëa bludgeoned Dantavakra's chest, shattering his heart. Dantavakra had a brother named Vidüratha, and he became distraught at Dantavakra's death. Taking up his sword, Vidüratha confronted Çré Kåñëa, but the Lord cut off Vidüratha's head with His Sudarçana disc. Lord Kåñëa then visited Våndävana for two months, and finally He returned to Dvärakä."

The Lord bathed in sacred places such as Prabhäsa, Tritaküpa and Viçäla, and eventually He came to the holy Naimiñäraëya forest, where great sages were performing an extended fire sacrifice. While being worshiped by the assembled sages and offered a seat of honor, the Lord noticed that Romaharñaëa Süta, sitting on the speaker's seat, had failed to stand in deference to Him. Greatly angered by this offense, Lord Balaräma killed Romaharñaëa by touching him with the tip of a blade of kuça grass."

Therefore, even though You are above the Vedic injunctions, we request You to set a perfect example for the general populace by atoning for this sin.\" Then Çré Baladeva, following the Vedic maxim that \"one's son takes birth as one's own self,\" granted to Romaharñaëa's son Ugraçravä the position of speaker of the Puräëas, and in accordance with the sages' desires He promised Ugraçravä a long life with unfailing sensory capacity."
