    "translation": "Their lotuslike faces extraordinarily beautiful, being decorated with saffron and newly grown kuìkuma, the wives of the cowherd men hurried to the house of mother Yaçodä with presentations in their hands. Because of natural beauty, the wives had full hips and full breasts, which moved as they hurried along.",

            "content": "The cowherd men and women in the villages lived a very natural life, and the women developed a natural feminine beauty, with full hips and breasts. Because women in modern civilization do not live naturally, their hips and breasts do not develop this natural fullness. Because of artificial living, women have lost their natural beauty, although they claim to be independent and advanced in material civilization. This description of the village women gives a clear example of the contrast between natural life and the artificial life of a condemned society, such as that of the Western countries, where topless, bottomless beauty may be easily purchased in clubs and shops and for public advertisements. The word balibhiù indicates that the women were carrying gold coins, jeweled necklaces, nice cloths, newly grown grass, sandalwood pulp, flower garlands and similar offerings on plates made of gold. Such offerings are called bali. The words tvaritaà jagmuù indicate how happy the village women were to understand that mother Yaçodä had given birth to a wonderful child known as Kåñëa."
