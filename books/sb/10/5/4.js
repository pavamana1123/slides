    "translation": "O King, by the passing of time, land and other material possessions are purified; by bathing, the body is purified; and by being cleansed, unclean things are purified. By purificatory ceremonies, birth is purified; by austerity, the senses are purified; and by worship and charity offered to the brähmaëas, material possessions are purified. By satisfaction, the mind is purified; and by self-realization, or Kåñëa consciousness, the soul is purified.",

In India five thousand years ago, even in the villages such as that of Nanda Mahäräja, people knew know to purify things, and thus they enjoyed even material life without contamination."
