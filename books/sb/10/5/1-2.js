    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: Nanda Mahäräja was naturally very magnanimous, and when Lord Çré Kåñëa appeared as his son, he was overwhelmed by jubilation. Therefore, after bathing and purifying himself and dressing himself properly, he invited brähmaëas who knew how to recite Vedic mantras. After having these qualified brähmaëas recite auspicious Vedic hymns, he arranged to have the Vedic birth ceremony celebrated for his newborn child according to the rules and regulations, and he also arranged for worship of the demigods and forefathers.",

The word tu, he says, is not used to fulfill the sentence, because without tu the sentence is complete. Therefore the word tu is used for a different purpose. Although Kåñëa appeared as the son of Devaké, Devaké and Vasudeva did not enjoy the jäta-karma, the festival of the birth ceremony. Instead, this ceremony was enjoyed by Nanda Mahäräja, as stated here (nandas tv ätmaja utpanne jätählädo mahä-manäù). When Nanda Mahäräja met Vasudeva, Vasudeva could not disclose, \"Your son Kåñëa is actually my son. You are His father in a different way, spiritually.\" Because of fear of Kaàsa, Vasudeva could not observe the festival for Kåñëa's birth, Nanda Mahäräja, however, took full advantage of this opportunity."

            "content": "The jäta-karma ceremony can take place when the umbilical cord, connecting the child and the placenta, is cut. However, since Kåñëa was brought by Vasudeva to the house of Nanda Mahäräja, where was the chance for this to happen? In this regard, Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura desires to prove with evidence from many çästras that Kåñëa actually took birth as the son of Yaçodä before the birth of Yogamäyä, who is therefore described as the Lord's younger sister. Even though there may be doubts about the cutting of the umbilical cord, and even though it is possible that this was not done, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, such events are regarded as factual. Kåñëa appeared as Varähadeva from the nostril of Brahmä, and therefore Brahmä is described as the father of Varähadeva. Also significant are the words kärayäm äsa vidhivat. Being overwhelmed with jubilation over the birth of his son, Nanda Mahäräja did not see whether the cord was cut or not. Thus he performed the ceremony very gorgeously. According to the opinion of some authorities, Kåñëa was actually born as the son of Yaçodä. In any case, without regard for material understandings, we can accept that Nanda Mahäräja's celebration for the ceremony of Kåñëa's birth was proper. This ceremony is therefore well known everywhere as Nandotsava."
