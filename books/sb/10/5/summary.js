Therefore the King of Vraja, Mahäräja Nanda, wanted to perform the birth ceremony for his child, and this he did. During this great festival, Nanda Mahäräja gave in charity to all present whatever they desired. After the festival, Nanda Mahäräja put the cowherd men in charge of protecting Gokula, and then he went to Mathurä to pay official taxes to Kaàsa. In Mathurä, Nanda Mahäräja met Vasudeva. Nanda Mahäräja and Vasudeva were brothers, and Vasudeva praised Nanda Mahäräja's good fortune because he knew that Kåñëa had accepted Nanda Mahäräja as His father. When Vasudeva inquired from Nanda Mahäräja about the welfare of the child, Nanda Mahäräja informed him all about Våndävana, and Vasudeva was very much satisfied by this, although he expressed his grief because Devaké's many children had been killed by Kaàsa. Nanda Mahäräja consoled Vasudeva by saying that everything happens according to destiny and that one who knows this is not aggrieved. Expecting many disturbances in Gokula, Vasudeva then advised Nanda Mahäräja not to wait in Mathurä, but to return to Våndävana as soon as possible. Thus Nanda Mahäräja took leave of Vasudeva and returned to Våndävana with the other cowherd men on their bullock carts."
