Thus he appointed the local cowherd men to protect his home and child. He wanted to go immediately to Mathurä to pay the taxes due and also to offer some presentation for the sake of his newborn son. For the protection of the child, he had worshiped various demigods and forefathers and given charity to everyone's satisfaction. Similarly, Nanda Mahäräja wanted not only to pay Kaàsa the yearly taxes but also to offer some presentation so that Kaàsa too would be satisfied. His only concern was how to protect his transcendental child, Kåñëa."
