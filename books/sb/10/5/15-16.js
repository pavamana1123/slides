    "translation": "The great-minded Mahäräja Nanda gave clothing, ornaments and cows in charity to the cowherd men in order to please Lord Viñëu, and thus he improved the condition of his own son in all respects. He distributed charity to the sütas, the mägadhas, the vandés, and men of all other professions, according to their educational qualifications, and satisfied everyone's desires.",

            "content": "Although it has become fashionable to speak of daridra-näräyaëa, the words viñëor ärädhanärthäya do not mean that all the people satisfied by Nanda Mahäräja in this great ceremony were Viñëus. They were not daridra, nor were they Näräyaëa. Rather, they were devotees of Näräyaëa, and by their educational qualifications they would satisfy Näräyaëa. Therefore, satisfying them was an indirect way of satisfying Lord Viñëu. Mad-bhakta-püjäbhyadhikä . One's real self-interest lies in satisfying Lord Viñëu. Not satisfying Lord Viñëu but instead attempting to become happy through material adjustments (bahir-artha-mäninaù) is the wrong way for happiness. Because Viñëu is the root of everything, if Viñëu is pleased, everyone is pleased; in particular, one's children and family members become happy in all respects. Nanda Mahäräja wanted to see his newborn child happy. That was his purpose. Therefore he wanted to satisfy Lord Viñëu, and to satisfy Lord Viñëu it was necessary to satisfy His devotees, such as the learned brähmaëas, mägadhas and sütas. Thus, in a roundabout way, ultimately it was Lord Viñëu who was to be satisfied."
