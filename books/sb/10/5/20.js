Furthermore, it is learned from the notes of Çrépäda Madhväcärya that Vasudeva and Nanda Mahäräja were stepbrothers. Vasudeva's father, Çürasena, married a vaiçya girl, and from her Nanda Mahäräja was born. Later, Nanda Mahäräja himself married a vaiçya girl, Yaçodä. Therefore his family is celebrated as a vaiçya family, and Kåñëa, identifying Himself as their son, took charge of vaiçya activities (kåñi-go-rakñya-väëijyam ). Balaräma represents plowing the land for agriculture and therefore always carries in His hand a plow, whereas Kåñëa tends cows and therefore carries a flute in His hand. Thus the two brothers represent kåñi-rakñya and go-rakñya."
