Because her husband was imprisoned by Kaàsa, she was not very happy, but on the occasion of Kåñëa-janmäñöamé, Nandotsava, when Nanda Mahäräja gave dresses and ornaments to others, he also gave gorgeous garments and ornaments to Rohiëé so that she could take part in the festival. Thus she also was busy receiving the women who were guests. Because of her good fortune in being able to raise Kåñëa and Balaräma together, she is described as mahä-bhägä, greatly fortunate."
