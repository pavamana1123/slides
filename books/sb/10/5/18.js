    "translation": "O Mahäräja Parékñit, the home of Nanda Mahäräja is eternally the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His transcendental qualities and is therefore always naturally endowed with the opulence of all wealth. Yet beginning from Lord Kåñëa's appearance there, it became the place for the pastimes of the goddess of fortune.",

The abode of Kåñëa is always served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. Wherever Kåñëa goes, the goddess of fortune naturally resides with Him. The chief of the goddesses of fortune is Çrématé Rädhäräëé. Therefore, Kåñëa's appearance in the land of Vraja indicated that the chief goddess of fortune, Rädhäräëé, would also appear there very soon. Nanda Mahäräja's abode was already opulent, and since Kåñëa had appeared, it would be opulent in all respects."
