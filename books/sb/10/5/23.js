Thus Vasudeva indirectly asked Nanda Mahäräja whether he had actually begotten a male child or a female child. Vasudeva knew that Yaçodä had given birth to a female child, whom he had stolen and replaced with a male child. This was a great mystery, and Vasudeva wanted to determine whether this mystery was already known to Nanda Mahäräja. On inquiring, however, he was confident that the mystery of Kåñëa's birth and His being placed in the care of Yaçodä was still hidden. There was no danger, since Kaàsa at least could not learn what had already happened."
