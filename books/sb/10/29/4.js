The song of His flute entered through the ears of the gopés, into the inner treasure chamber of their hearts. That wonderful music stole all their most valuable possessions—their sobriety, shyness, fear and discrimination, along with their very minds—and in a split second this music delivered all these goods to Kåñëa. Now each gopé went to beg the Lord to return her personal property. Each beautiful young girl was thinking, 'I have to capture that great thief,' and thus they went forward, each unknown to the others.\""
