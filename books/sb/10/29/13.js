In fact, all other powers are His energy and thus function according to His will. The Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38) states, såñöi sthiti-pralaya-sädhana-çaktir ekä/ chäyeva yasya bhuvanäni bibharti durgä/ icchänurüpam api yasya ca ceñöate sä: \"The mighty Durgä, who creates, maintains and annihilates the material worlds, is the potency ot the Supreme Lord, and she moves like His shadow, according to His desire.\" Thus because the Lord's spiritual influence does not depend on whether someone understands Him or not, the gopés' spontaneous love for Kåñëa guaranteed their spiritual perfection."

For various other reasons also, Çiçupäla was consumed with envy of Lord Kåñëa, and finally he insanely offended Him in a great assembly called the Räjasüya sacrifice. At that time Kåñëa nonchalantly cut off Çiçupäla's head and gave him liberation. Everyone present saw the effulgent soul of Çiçupäla rise out of his dead body and merge into the existence of the Lord. The Seventh Canto explains that Çiçupäla was an incarnation of a gatekeeper in the spiritual world cursed to take birth on the earth as a demon. Since even Çiçupäla was liberated by the Lord, who took into consideration the whole situation, then what to speak of the gopés, who loved Kåñëa more than anything."
