The gopés now appeal to the Lord to fulfill this prediction by being merciful and granting them direct service, just as Lord Näräyaëa awards direct service to His loving devotees. The gopés emphasize that they did not give up their families and homes with the hope of securing a higher pleasure from Kåñëa. They are simply begging for service, revealing their pure-hearted devotion. The gopés think, \"If in the course of Your pursuing Your happiness we somehow or other become happy by seeing Your face, what is the harm in that?\""
