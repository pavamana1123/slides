    "translation": "For those gopés who could not go to see Kåñëa, intolerable separation from their beloved caused an intense agony that burned away all impious karma. By meditating upon Him they realized His embrace, and the ecstasy they then felt exhausted their material piety. Although Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Soul, these girls simply thought of Him as their male lover and associated with Him in that intimate mood. Thus their karmic bondage was nullified and they abandoned their gross material bodies.",

Thus to outsiders Çukadeva says that Kåñëa gave the gopés liberation, but to the confidential hearers Çukadeva reveals that when the gopés experienced separation from their beloved there arose in them both immeasurable unhappiness and immeasurable happiness, and that they gradually achieved their desired goal."

            "content": "\"Thus the verse can be understood as follows: Because of their intolerable separation from their beloved, the gopés felt terrible agony, by which they caused all inauspicious things to tremble. In other words, when people in general hear of the gopés' extreme agony in separation from their beloved, they abandon thousands of inauspicious things—things even as fearsome as the subterranean fires of millions of universes or the powerful poison swallowed by Lord Çiva. More specifically, those who hear of the gopés' love in separation give up their terrible false ego and, thinking themselves defeated, are shaken. When the gopés meditated on Lord Acyuta, He became manifest and personally came to them, and they experienced great joy by embracing His body, which was full of transcendental love for them. The gopés also experienced great joy by exhibiting personal characteristics and a sense of identification appropriate to such love. That joy made all their good fortune, both material and spiritual, seem paltry by comparison."

Thus hearing of the gopés' distress and the joy that arose, respectively, out of their separation from the Supreme Lord and their union with Him, anyone can get rid of all the reactions of his past activities, both sinful and pious. Vaiñëavas certainly do not think that sinful and pious reactions can be destroyed only by being lived out, since, after all, neither separation from the Supreme Lord nor direct association with Him are in the category of karma. This kind of elimination of karmic reactions occurs in the stage of bhajana, for those who have come to the level of anartha-nivåtti."

Even though such a concept is ordinarily contemptible, the gopés realized Kåñëa in an even fuller sense than did Rukmiëé and His other queens, who thought of Him most respectfully as their husband. That thinking of the Lord as one's paramour is superior to thinking of Him as one's husband is proved by the fact that unbridled pure love is superior to domesticated love. This idea is borne out by the following words of Çré Uddhava: yä dustyajaà sva-janam ärya-pathaà ca hitvä. 'These ladies of Vraja abandoned their families and their advanced religious principles, even though to do so is very difficult.' "

As Bhéñma stated, Kåñëa's pastime of acting as Arjuna's chariot driver was even more elevated than the pastimes in which He acted as a mighty King of kings: vijaya-ratha-kuöumba ätta-totre/ dhåta-haya-raçmini tac-chriyeskñaëéye. 'I concentrate upon the chariot driver of Arjuna, who stood with a whip in His right hand and a bridle rope in His left, and who was very careful to protect Arjuna's chariot by all means.'  Similarly, in the Lord's appearance as Kåñëa we see that the normally inferior conjugal räsa becomes better than the normally superior mood of çänta-rasa, as also the attitude of loving a paramour becomes superior to the loving exchange between legitimate spouses, and lowly guïjä necklaces, red oxide paste and peacock feathers become better than the most excellent jeweled ornaments."

This objection is replied to by the words beginning jahuù. The word deham is used here in the singular form to indicate unity of category, even though the gopés are many. Some authorities say that by the power of Yogamäyä these gopés' bodies disappeared in a way no one noticed, but other authorities say that the 'body' referred to in this context is the inferior body, composed of the modes of material nature. Thus by the prominence of the adjective guëa-mayam, it is understood that before the gopés heard the sound of Kåñëa's flute their bodies had been twofold, material and spiritual, and upon hearing the flute they gave up the material bodies, which their husbands had enjoyed.

Thus the devotees make the Lord's transcendental qualities the objects of their senses, as stated by the Lord Himself: nirguëo mad-apäçrayaù.  In this way the devotees' bodies transcend the material modes. Yet sometimes the devotees may take as their sense objects mundane sounds and so on, and that is material.

When one achieves totally pure love of God, the material portions of the body disappear and the body becomes completely spiritual.

'Then they [the gopés] replied to Uddhava, feeling satisfied because His message had reminded them of Kåñëa.' Here we understand that the gopés speaking to Uddhava were the ones who had not had the chance to participate directly in the räsa dance because of being held captive in their homes. Thus the conclusion is that they gave up their material bodies without dying. Parched by the intense heat of separation, their material bodies gave up their materiality and became purely spiritual, just like the bodies of such great devotees as Dhruva Mahäräja.

From the appearance of the fruits the servant can tell which are ripe in the middle but still raw on the outside and thus not yet fit for the king.

Other muni-cäré gopés still retained some connection with the external material body, but even they, after being parched by the heat of separation from Çré Kåñëa, gave up the materiality of their bodies and assumed perfectly transcendental bodies, purified of all taint of contact with other men. On the night of the räsa dance, Yogamäyä sent some of these gopés out behind those who had already gone out; others, who Yogamäyä saw still had a slight amount of contamination, she kept back to further purify with the heat of separation, and then she sent them out on some other night."
