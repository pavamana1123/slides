    "translation": "Lord Kåñëa saw the unbroken disk of the full moon glowing with the red effulgence of newly applied vermilion, as if it were the face of the goddess of fortune. He also saw the kumuda lotuses opening in response to the moon's presence and the forest gently illumined by its rays. Thus the Lord began to play sweetly on His flute, attracting the minds of the beautiful-eyed gopés.",

            "content": "The word jagau in this verse indicates that Lord Kåñëa played songs on His flute, as confirmed in Text 40 by the words kä stry aìga te kala-padäyata-veëu-gétä. The word ramä may indicate not only Lord Viñëu's consort but also Çrématé Rädhäräëé, the original goddess of fortune. Lord Kåñëa appeared in the dynasty of the moon-god, and the moon plays a prominent role here in preparing for the Lord's entrance into the midst of the räsa dance."
