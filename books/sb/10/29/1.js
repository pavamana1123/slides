In his description of the Lord's räsa dance in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda painstakingly explains the spiritual purity of these transcendental activities. Those advanced in the science of Kåñëa—the great teachers, or äcäryas—leave no doubt that Lord Kåñëa is full and satisfied in Himself, free of all material desire, which is, after all, a sense of incompleteness or lack."

There is no reason to deny the beautiful reality of an absolute person able to perform absolute romantic activities, of which our so-called romance is merely a shadow or perverted reflection. The irrational insistence that material activities cannot be a reflection of the perfect, spiritual activities performed by God reflects the unimaginative emotional disposition of those who oppose the reality of Çré Kåñëa. This psychological disposition of the nondevotees, which leads them to fervently deny the very existence of the absolute person, unfortunately boils down to what may be succinctly described as envy, since the overwhelming majority of the impersonal critics eagerly pursue their own romantic affairs, which they consider quite real and even \"spiritual.\""

The Vedänta-sütra begins by declaring that the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, and even Western philosophy was born in a somewhat awkward attempt at finding the original One behind the apparent many of material existence. Conjugal love, one of the most intense and demanding aspects of human existence, can hardly have nothing at all to do with supreme reality."

Thus it is clearly stated here that when Kåñëa decided to enjoy the romantic atmosphere of autumn, \"He resorted to His spiritual potency\" (yoga-mäyäm upäçritaù). The spiritual nature of Lord Kåñëa's conjugal affairs is a major theme in this section of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam."

The most attractive ladies of all are the young gopés of Våndävana, who are Lord Kåñëa's internal potency, and this chapter tells how He enjoyed their brilliant feminine qualities—even though, as Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has mentioned, Lord Kåñëa was an eight-year-old boy when these events took place."

Such people are shocked and dismayed to find out that the Lord can enjoy His own loving affairs with His own transcendental senses. In truth, Çré Kåñëa is the original Cupid, and His exciting conjugal pastimes will be described in this section of the Bhägavatam."

The Lord could hardly allow His boyhood to pass without exhibiting the supreme loving affairs between a young boy and young girls. Thus Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura quotes Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé as follows: kaiçoraà saphalé-karoti kalayan kuïje vihäraà hariù. \"Lord Hari perfects His youth by arranging loving pastimes in the groves of the Våndävana forest.\""
