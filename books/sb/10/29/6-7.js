    "translation": "Some of them were getting dressed, feeding milk to their infants or rendering personal service to their husbands, but they all gave up these duties and went to meet Kåñëa. Other gopés were taking their evening meals, washing themselves, putting on cosmetics or applying kajjala to their eyes. But all the gopés stopped these activities at once and, though their clothes and ornaments were in complete disarray, rushed off to Kåñëa.",
