    "translation": "Our dear Kåñëa, as an expert in religion You have advised us that the proper religious duty for women is to faithfully serve their husbands, children and other relatives. We agree that this principle is valid, but actually this service should be rendered to You. After all, O Lord, You are the dearmost friend of all embodied souls. You are their most intimate relative and indeed their very Self.",

Since all such classes of living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, one who has surrendered to the Lord's service has no need to serve such persons separately.\" Authority descends from the author of all existence, the Supreme Lord. Natural figures of authority such as husbands, mothers, government leaders and sages gain their power and authority from the Supreme Lord and should thus represent the Absolute Truth to those who follow them. If one wholeheartedly engages in loving service to the original, Supreme Truth, one need not indirectly serve the Absolute Truth through the above-mentioned secondary authorities."

A bona fide äcärya, or spiritual master, is the transparent medium leading the disciple to the lotus feet of Kåñëa. All indirect authorities become obsolete when one is directly in touch with the Absolute Truth. The gopés wanted to explain this basic point to Kåñëa, and some of the bolder young girls among them attempted to defeat Çré Kåñëa with His own statements, as exemplified in this verse."
