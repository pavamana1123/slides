According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, as Çukadeva began speaking of the gopés' conjugal love for Kåñëa, the King noticed the expressions on the faces of some of the more materialistic persons present there and realized the doubt lurking in their hearts. Therefore, although the King thoroughly knew the purport of Çukadeva's words, he presented himself as experiencing personal doubt so that he could eradicate the doubt of others. That is why he asked this question."
