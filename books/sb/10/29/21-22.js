The word satéù means that the gopés are loyal to their husbands; therefore Kåñëa indicates that the gopés should serve their husbands so the latter can accomplish their religious duties, and that the gopés should also be considered worshipable because of their chastity. All this Kåñëa says to the gopés who are married. And now to the unmarried girls He says, 'The calves are crying, so see to it that they get milk.' To the muni-cäré gopés He says, 'Your babies are crying, so feed them milk.' \""

Furthermore, we have the Yamunä on all sides, and there are cool, gentle, fragrant breezes blowing. These are all transcendental opulences that stimulate loving exchanges, and since I am also here as the foremost ecstatic opulence—the object of love—let us now test how much expertise you can show in relishing rasas.'\"In Text 22 He means to say, 'Thus for a long time, for the entire duration of this night, don't leave, but rather stay here and enjoy with Me. Don't go serve your husbands and the gentle women—your mothers-in-law and so forth. It would not be fitting for you to waste such beauty and youth, which are gifts of the creator. Nor should you milk the cows or give milk to the calves and babies. What do you, who are so full of ecstatic attraction for Me, have to do with these affairs?' \""

Thus as Çré Kåñëa spoke about the beauty of the forest, the gopés felt embarrassed and bewildered and looked upward at the trees, and as He spoke about the Yamunä they looked all around at the river. Their absolute purity and simplicity, along with their absolute devotion to Lord Kåñëa in the conjugal mood, created the most beautiful pastimes ever exhibited in this universe."
