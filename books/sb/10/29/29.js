    "translation": "Their heads hanging down and their heavy, sorrowful breathing drying up their reddened lips, the gopés scratched the ground with their toes. Tears flowed from their eyes, carrying their kajjala and washing away the vermilion smeared on their breasts. Thus they stood, silently bearing the burden of their unhappiness.",

And if we cannot properly love Kåñëa, what is the use of our lives?\" Their reddish lips were drying up because of the hot breathing that arose from their unhappiness. When the hot sun dries ripe red bimba fruits, dark spots appear on them and they grow soft. The beautiful lips of the gopés similarly changed in appearance. They stood silently before Kåñëa, unable to speak."
