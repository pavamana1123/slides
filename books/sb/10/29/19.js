        },
        {
            "type": "normal",
            "content": "\"[The gopés thought,] 'Alas, alas, even after shattering our family responsibilities, our sobriety and our shame and enjoying us day after day, and after now dragging us here by the sound of His flute, He is asking us why we have come!'\"As the gopés cast sidelong glances at one another, the Lord said, 'If you try to tell Me that you have come to get night-blooming flowers to use in the worship of God, and that it is these flowers you are looking at with your sidelong glances, I will have to reject your excuse as unacceptable, since neither the time, place nor persons involved are appropriate.'\n\"This is the Lord's meaning in the verse beginning rajané. He might have said, 'Even though there is abundant moonlight, this time of night is very fearsome because many snakes, scorpions and other dangerous creatures too small for you to see are lying beneath the creepers, roots and twigs. Therefore this time is unsuitable for gathering flowers. And not only the time but also this place is unsuitable for you to gather flowers, because at night terrible creatures such as tigers are abroad here. Therefore you should go back to Vraja.'\n\" 'But,' the gopés may object, 'let us just rest for a few minutes, and then we will go.'\n\"Then the Lord might reply, 'Women shouldn't remain in this kind of place.' In other words, 'Because of the time and place, it is wrong for persons like yourselves to stay here even for a moment.'\n\"Furthermore, by the word su-madhyamäù, 'O slender-waisted ones,' the Lord implied, 'You are beautiful young girls, and I am a beautiful young boy. Because you are all very chaste and I am a brahmacäré, as confirmed by the words kåñëo brahmacäré in the çruti [Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad], there should be no fault in our being in the same place. Nonetheless, the mind can never be trusted-neither yours nor My own.'\n\"The Lord's inner eagerness thus hinted at is obvious if we read His words between the lines, as follows: 'If out of shyness you cannot tell Me the reason you've come, then don't speak. I already know it anyway, so just listen as I tell it to you.' Thus the Lord speaks the words beginning rajané . \""

Consequently this night should not frighten you.' Or else Kåñëa may have meant, 'You should not be afraid of your own husbands and other relatives because, the night being populated by fearsome animals, they will not come near this place. Therefore please do not go back to Vraja [na pratiyäta], but stay here in My company [iha stheyam].'"

In the first case, as translated above, Lord Kåñëa continues to tease the gopés by telling them the night is dangerous and inauspicious and that they should go home. But Kåñëa is simultaneously saying exactly the opposite—namely, that there is absolutely no reason for the gopés to fear coming to the Lord, that the night is quite auspicious and that the girls should under no circumstances go back home. Thus Lord Kåñëa simultaneously teases and enchants the gopés with His words."
