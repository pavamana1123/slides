    "translation": "Goddess Lakñmé, whose glance is sought after by the demigods with great endeavor, has achieved the unique position of always remaining on the chest of her Lord, Näräyaëa. Still, she desires the dust of His lotus feet, even though she has to share that dust with Tulasé-devé and indeed with the Lord's many other servants. Similarly, we have approached the dust of Your lotus feet for shelter.",

Thus the gopés urge Lord Kåñëa not to be guilty of a double standard. Since the Lord gave the goddess of fortune a place on His chest and also allowed her to seek the dust of His lotus feet, Kåñëa should certainly give the same opportunity to His most loving devotees, the gopés. \"After all\" the gopés plead, \"seeking the dust of Your lotus feet is perfectly justified, and You should encourage us in this endeavor and not try to send us away.\""
