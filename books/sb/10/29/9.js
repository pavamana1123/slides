It is not always possible to include these extensive descriptions, but we will quote in its entirety his comments on this verse. It is our sincere recommendation to the learned Vaiñëava community that a qualified devotee of the Lord present the entire commentary of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté on the Tenth Canto as a separate book, which will undoubtedly be appreciated by devotees and nondevotees alike. The äcärya's comments on this verse are as follows:"

The sädhana-siddhas are of two categories: those who belong to special groups and those who do not. And there are also two classes of the gopés belonging to special groups: namely the çruti-cärés, who come from the group of the personified Vedas, and the åñi-cärés, who come from the group of sages who saw Lord Rämacandra in the Daëòakäraëya forest."

Similarly, we have the words of the Gautaméya-tantra, hlädiné yä mahä-çaktiù.

By associating with the eternally perfect gopés, some of these new gopés fully manifested pürva-raga loving attraction for Kåñëa as soon as they reached puberty (This kind of attraction develops even before one meets the beloved.) When these new gopés got the direct audience of Kåñëa and physically associated with Him, all their remaining contamination became burned up, and they achieved the advanced stages of prema, sneha and so on."

But a short time later even these gopés developed their pürva-raga by hankering intensely for the physical association of Kåñëa—a hankering they acquired by associating with the advanced gopés. Becoming worthy recipients of the mercy of the perfected gopés, they assumed transcendental bodies fit to be enjoyed by Kåñëa, and when Yogamäyä failed to help them overcome their husbands' attempts to keep them from going out, they felt themselves cast into the worst calamity. Viewing their husbands, brothers, fathers and other family members as enemies, they came close to dying.
