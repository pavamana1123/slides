    "translation": "Çré Kåñëa went with the gopés to the bank of the Yamunä, where the sand was cooling and the wind, enlivened by the river's waves, bore the fragrance of lotuses. There Kåñëa threw His arms around the gopés and embraced them. He aroused Cupid in the beautiful young ladies of Vraja by touching their hands, hair, thighs, belts and breasts, by playfully scratching them with His fingernails, and also by joking with them, glancing at them and laughing with them. In this way the Lord enjoyed His pastimes.",
