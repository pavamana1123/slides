After all, that is the Lord's purpose—to bring all conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. The Lord's conjugal affairs with the gopés fit in very nicely with that program because we who are actually lusty in material consciousness can be purified and liberated by hearing of them."
