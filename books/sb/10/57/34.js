Superficially these evils may have been caused by Akrüra's absence, and also by the absence of the auspicious Syamantaka jewel. But we should recall that Dvärakä is the eternal abode of Lord Kåñëa; it is a city of divine bliss because the Lord resides there. Still, to execute His pastimes as a prince of this world, Lord Kåñëa did the needful and summoned Akrüra."
