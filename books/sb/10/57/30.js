These disturbances often manifest as natural calamities like earthquakes, tidal waves or extreme weather. Nowadays materialistic people attribute these disturbances to earthly causes, not realizing that they constitute punishment at the hands of superior beings. The word bhautikäù refers to trouble caused by fellow creatures of the earth, such as human beings, animals and insects."

            "content": "Some residents of Dvärakä felt that the unusual calamities were due to Akrüra's absence, forgetting (as described in the next verse) that the Supreme Lord's personal presence in Dvärakä precluded that possibility. Because when the Lord comes to earth His pastimes resemble those of human beings, the principle of \"familiarity breeds contempt\" comes into play. It appears that during the lives of many saintly persons and incarnations of God there always exists a class of people who fail to appreciate, or who only occasionally appreciate, the position of the great souls among them. On the other hand, the fortunate and enlightened souls who recognize the true position of the Lord and His associates are supremely blessed."
