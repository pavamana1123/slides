The äcäryas provide it as follows: Çréla Jéva Gosvämé states that Akrüra, although a first-class, pure devotee of the Lord, was a victim of the anger directed against him by the residents of Gokula because he took Lord Kåñëa away from Våndävana. The gosvämé further states that Kåtavarmä had associated with Kaàsa—both of them being members of the Bhoja dynasty—and thus Kåtavarmä was now suffering from this undesirable association."

Under normal circumstances Akrüra and Kåtavarmä would have been most pleased that Lord Kåñëa married the beautiful Satyabhämä. Being pure devotees, they could not actually be unhappy about this match, nor could they become jealous rivals of the Lord. Therefore they had an ulterior motive in behaving like His rivals."
