Indeed, for the second time the Lord brought the jewel to Dvärakä to establish His integrity there. This amazing series of incidents demonstrates that even when Lord Kåñëa descends to this world there is a tendency for His \"peers\" to criticize Him. The whole material world is infected by the faultfinding propensity, and in this chapter the Supreme Lord demonstrates the nature of this undesirable quality."
