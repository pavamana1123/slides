With Kåñëa out of Dvärakä, Akrüra and Kåtavarmä incited Çatadhanvä to steal the Syamantaka jewel from Saträjit. Bewildered by their words, the sinful Çatadhanvä murdered King Saträjit in his sleep and stole the gem. Queen Satyabhämä was overcome with grief at the death of her father, and she rushed to Hastinäpura to report the sorrowful news to Çré Kåñëa. Together with Lord Baladeva, Kåñëa then returned to Dvärakä to kill Çatadhanvä."

Kåñëa and Balaräma pursued him, and Lord Kåñëa beheaded him with His sharp-edged disc. When the Lord could not find the Syamantaka jewel on Çatadhanvä's person, Baladeva told Him that Çatadhanvä must have left it in someone's care. Baladeva further suggested that Kåñëa return to Dvärakä to find the jewel while He, Baladeva, would take the opportunity to visit the King of Videha. Thus Lord Balaräma traveled to Mithilä and remained there for a few years, during which He taught King Duryodhana the art of fighting with a club."

Soon many kinds of disturbances-mental, physical and so on-began to afflict Dvärakä, and the citizens concluded that the cause of these troubles must be Akrüra's exile. The city elders explained, \"Once there was a drought in Benares, and the king of the region gave his daughter in marriage to Akrüra's father, who was visiting Benares at the time. As a result of this gift, the drought ended.\" The elders, thinking Akrüra had the same power as his father, declared that Akrüra should be brought back."

Still, He had Akrüra brought back to Dvärakä, and after properly honoring him with worship and greeting him with sweet words, Kåñëa told him, \"I know Çatadhanvä left the jewel in your care. Since Saträjit had no sons, his daughter's offspring are the just claimants to whatever property he has left behind. Nonetheless, it would be best for you to keep the troublesome jewel in your care. Just let Me show it once to My relatives.\" Akrüra presented Kåñëa with the jewel, which shone as brilliantly as the sun, and after the Lord had shown it to His family members He returned it to Akrüra."
