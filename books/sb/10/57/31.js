When the citizens of Dvärakä heard about this, some of them gossiped that Kåñëa, considering Akrüra a rival, had sent him into exile. To dispel this new and incredible stain on His reputation, Lord Kåñëa created various calamities in Dvärakä, thus inducing the citizens to call for Akrüra's return, which the Lord then ordered."
