According to our limited understanding, we act in this world, but Lord Kåñëa, with His unlimited understanding, performs infinite works of creation, maintenance and annihilation. As Çréla Jéva Gosvämé points out, even the functions of the gross elements, such as air, depend on Him. The Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.8.1) confirms this: bhéñäsmäd vätaù-pavate. \"Out of fear of Him, the wind blows.\" Thus Lord Çré Kåñëa is the ultimate object of worship for all living beings."
