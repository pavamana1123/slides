When they finally heard from Närada Muni how Aniruddha had been captured, a large army of the best Yädava warriors, under Kåñëa's protection, set off for Bäëäsura's capital and laid siege to it. Bäëäsura fiercely opposed them with his own army of equal size. To help Bäëäsura, Lord Çiva, accompanied by Kärtikeya and a horde of mystic sages, took up arms against Balaräma and Kåñëa. Bäëa began fighting against Sätyaki, and Bäëa's son fought against Sämba. All the demigods assembled in the sky to witness the battle. With His arrows Lord Kåñëa harassed the followers of Lord Çiva, and by putting Lord Çiva into a state of confusion He was able to destroy Bäëäsura's army. Kärtikeya was so strongly beaten by Pradyumna that he fled the battlefield, while the remnants of Bäëäsura's army, harried by the blows of Lord Balaräma's club, scattered in all directions."

But the Lord immediately killed Bäëa's chariot driver and broke his chariot and bow, and then He sounded His Päïcajanya conchshell. Next Bäëäsura's mother, trying to save her son, appeared naked in front of Lord Kåñëa, who averted His face to avoid looking at her. Seeing his chance, Bäëa fled into his city."

Seeing the Çiva-jvara, Kåñëa released His Viñëu-jvara. The Çiva-jvara was overwhelmed by the Viñëu-jvara; having nowhere else to turn for shelter, the Çiva-jvara began to address Lord Kåñëa, glorifying Him and asking for mercy. Lord Kåñëa was pleased with the Çiva-jvara, and after the Lord had promised him freedom from fear, the Çiva-jvara bowed down to Him and departed."

But Lord Kåñëa took His Sudarçana disc and began cutting off all the demon's arms Lord Çiva approached Kåñëa to pray for Bäëäsura's life, and when the Lord agreed to spare him, He spoke as follows to Çiva: \"Bäëäsura does not deserve to die, since he was born in the family of Prahläda Mahäräja. I have severed all but four of Bäëa's arms just to destroy his false pride, and I have annihilated his army because they were a burden to the earth. Henceforward he will be free from old age and death, and remaining fearless in all circumstances, he will be one of your principal attendants.\""

Kåñëa then set off for Dvärakä with Aniruddha and His bride leading the procession. When the newlyweds arrived at the Lord's capital, they were honored by the citizens, the Lord's relatives and the brähmaëas."
