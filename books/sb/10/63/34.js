This Absolute Truth is explained confidentially in the Vedas and is therefore difficult for an ordinary reader to understand. The following statements quoted by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé from the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad show how the Vedic sounds occasionally reveal the Absolute: Te hocur upäsanam etasya parätmano govindasyäkhilädhäriëo brühi (Pürva-khaëòa 17): \"They [the four Kumäras] said [to Brahmä], 'Please tell us how to worship Govinda, the Supreme Soul and the foundation of all that exists.' \" Cetanaç cetanänäm (Pürva-khaëòa 21): \"He is the chief of all living beings.\" And taà ha devam ätma-våtti-prakäçam (Pürva-khaëòa 23): \"One realizes that Supreme Godhead by first realizing one's own self.\" The great äcärya Jéva Gosvämé also quotes a verse from the Çrémad-Bhägavatam —güòhaà paraà brahma manuñya-liìgam—which refers to \"the Supreme Truth concealed in a humanlike form.\""
