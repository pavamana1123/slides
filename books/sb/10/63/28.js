But here he further states that those who do not surrender to the Supreme Lord are especially liable to punishment. Although the Çiva-jvara himself had acted violently up till now, since he has surrendered to the Lord and rectified himself, he hopes to receive the Lord's mercy. In other words, he has now become the Lord's devotee."
