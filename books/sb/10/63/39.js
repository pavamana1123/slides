With its energy the sun creates clouds, which cover our vision of the sun. Yet it is the sun that allows us to see the clouds and all other things as well. Similarly, the Lord expands His illusory potency and thus prevents us from directly seeing Him. Yet it is God alone who reveals to us His covering potency—namely, the material world—and thus the Lord is ätma-pradépa, \"self-luminous.\" It is the reality of His existence that makes all things visible."
