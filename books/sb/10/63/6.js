Still, although Çiva knew Lord Kåñëa would defeat him, he joined the battle against Him to demonstrate the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura states that Lord Çiva entered the battle for two reasons: first, to increase Lord Kåñëa's pleasure and enthusiasm; and second, to demonstrate that the Lord's incarnation as Kåñëa, although enacting humanlike pastimes, is superior to other avatäras, such as Lord Rämacandra. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté further states in this regard that Yogamäyä, Lord Kåñëa's internal potency, bewildered Lord Çiva just as she had bewildered Brahmä. In support of this statement, the äcärya cites the phrase brahma-rudrädi-mohanam from Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu. Of course, Yogamäyä's job is to make fine arrangements for the Lord's pastimes, and thus Çiva became enthusiastic to battle the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa."
