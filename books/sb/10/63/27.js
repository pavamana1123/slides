The demigods act as cosmic administrators, and the sages, by their teachings and their good example, illumine the path of self-realization and holiness. But those who transgress the natural law, the law of God, and live by committing violence against others are vanquished by the Supreme Lord in His various pastime incarnations. As the Lord states in the Bhagavad-gétä , ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham. He is impartial, but He responds appropriately to the actions of the living beings."
