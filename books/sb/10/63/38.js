The Lord is eka advitéyaù, \"one without a second,\" because there is no one equal to the Lord or different from Him. No one is completely equal to the Supreme Godhead, and yet because all the living beings are expansions of the potency of the Godhead, no one is qualitatively different from Him. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu nicely explains this inconceivable situation by stating that the Absolute Truth and the living beings are qualitatively one but quantitatively different. The Absolute possesses infinite spiritual consciousness, whereas the living beings possess infinitesimal consciousness, which is subject to being covered by illusion."

Çréla Jéva Gosvämé also quotes the following çruti-mantra: tat-puruñasya puruñatvam, which means \"Such constitutes the Lord's status as puruña.\" Actually, Lord Kåñëa is the essence of the puruña incarnation because He is turéya, as described in the present verse. Jéva Gosvämé explains the term turéya (literally \"the fourth\") by quoting Çrédhara Svämé's commentary to the Bhägavatam verse 11.15.16:"

            "content": "The last two lines of this verse are of special philosophical significance. Why is the Lord perceived differently by different persons, although He is one? A partial explanation is given here. By the agency of Mäyä, the Lord's external potency, material nature is in a constant state of transformation, vikära. In one sense, then, material nature is \"unreal,\" asat. But because God is the supreme reality, and because He is present within all things and all things are His potency, material objects and energies possess a degree of reality. Therefore some people see one aspect of material energy and think, \"This is reality,\" while other people see a different aspect of material energy and think, \"No, that is reality.\" Being conditioned souls, we are covered by different configurations of material nature, and thus we describe the Supreme Truth or the Supreme Lord in terms of our corrupted vision. Yet even the covering qualities of material nature, such as our conditioned intelligence, mind and senses, are real (being the potency of the Supreme Lord), and therefore through all things we can perceive, in a more or less subjective way, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is why the present verse states, pratéyase: \"You are perceived.\" Furthermore, without the manifestation of material nature's covering qualities, the creation could not fulfill its purpose—namely, to allow the conditioned souls to make their best attempt to enjoy without God so that they will finally understand the futility of such an illusory notion."
