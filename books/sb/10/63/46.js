Just as a father is happy to share his riches with a beloved son, so the Supreme Lord happily invests pure living beings with some of His potency and opulence. And just as a father proudly and happily observes the good qualities of his children, the Lord is most happy to glorify the pure living beings who are powerful in Kåñëa consciousness. Thus the Supreme Lord is pleased to glorify Lord Çiva by addressing him as bhagavän."
