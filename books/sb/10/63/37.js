However, it is out of the Lord's causeless mercy that He appears to us in a form visible to our mundane eyes. If we want to understand the Absolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa, we must hear from recognized authorities in Kåñëa consciousness, such as Lord Kåñëa Himself in the Bhagavad-gétä, or from Lord Çiva, a recognized Vaiñëava authority, who here glorifies the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
