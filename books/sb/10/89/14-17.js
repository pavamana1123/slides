    "translation": "Amazed upon hearing Bhågu's account, the sages were freed from all doubts and became convinced that Viñëu is the greatest Lord. From Him come peace; fearlessness; the essential principles of religion; detachment with knowledge; the eightfold powers of mystic yoga; and His glorification, which cleanses the mind of all impurities. He is known as the supreme destination for those who are peaceful and equipoised—the selfless, wise saints who have given up all violence. His most dear form is that of pure goodness, and the brähmaëas are His worshipable deities. Persons of keen intellect who have attained spiritual peace worship Him without selfish motives.",
