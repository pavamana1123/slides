Please quickly send these demons here to Me for the sake of their liberation.\" It is stated in Çré Hari-vaàça and in the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam that the path of gradual liberation passes through the intermediate station of Lord Mahä-Viñëu's abode, outside the eighth shell of the universe."
