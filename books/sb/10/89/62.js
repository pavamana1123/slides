Even though I am a mere mortal, by Kåñëa's mercy I have seen the Supreme Godhead, the root cause of everything.\" Then, after a moment, he thought again, \"But why did Lord Viñëu say that he took away the brähmaëa's children out of a desire to see Kåñëa? Why would the Supreme Personality of Godhead hanker to see His own expansion? This might be the effect of some peculiar temporary circumstance, but since He said didåkñuëä instead of didåkñatä—where the specific suffix -ñuëä carries the sense of a permanent characteristic, not a temporary one—it has to be concluded that He has always been wanting to see Kåñëa and myself. Even granted that this is so, why couldn't He simply see Kåñëa at Dvärakä? After all, Lord Mahä-Viñëu is the all-pervading creator of the universe, which He holds like an ämalaka fruit in His hand. Is it that He could not see Kåñëa in Dvärakä because Kåñëa does not allow anyone to see Him without His special sanction?"

He must have acted in this unusual way only because He could not give up His extreme eagerness to see Kåñëa. All right, He may have acted improperly for that reason, but why couldn't He have sent a servant to kidnap the brähmaëa's sons? Why did He Himself have to come to Dvärakä? Was stealing them out of Lord Kåñëa's capital so difficult that no one but Viñëu Himself could hope to accomplish it? I can understand that He intended to cause so much distress to a brähmaëa of Lord Kåñëa's city that Kåñëa would be unable to tolerate it; then He would grant Lord Viñëu His audience. Lord Viñëu inspired the distressed brähmaëa to pour out his complaints to Kåñëa in person. Thus it is clear that Çré Kåñëa's status of Godhood is superior to Lord Mahä-Viñëu's.\""
