    "translation": "Lord Kåñëa offered homage to Himself in this boundless form, and Arjuna, astonished at the sight of Lord Mahä-Viñëu, bowed down as well. Then, as the two of them stood before Him with joined palms, the almighty Mahä-Viñëu, supreme master of all rulers of the universe, smiled and spoke to them in a voice full of solemn authority.",

The Lord is ananta, possessed of countless manifestations, and this eight-armed form is among them. He is acyuta, \"never falling from His position,\" in the sense that He never stops engaging in His humanlike pastimes as a cowherd boy of Våndävana. Thus to safeguard the special sanctity of His humanlike pastimes as Kåñëa, He offered obeisances to His own plenary expansion."

With solemn authority He spoke in such a way as to bewilder Arjuna, in obedience to Çré Kåñëa's intention. His smile hinted at His private thoughts, which Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté has revealed for our benefit: \"My dear Kåñëa, by Your desire I will describe My superiority, even though I am Your expansion. At the same time, however, I will subtly imply in My statements the supreme position of Your beauty, character and power and the fact that You are the source from which I emanate. Just see how clever I am—that in front of Arjuna I am confidentially divulging My true identity as nondifferent from You.\""
