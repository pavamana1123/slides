    "translation": "Arjuna then saw the omnipresent and omnipotent Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mahä-Viñëu, sitting at ease on the serpent bed. His bluish complexion was the color of a dense raincloud, He wore a beautiful yellow garment, His face looked charming, His broad eyes were most attractive, and He had eight long, handsome arms. His profuse locks of hair were bathed on all sides in the brilliance reflected from the clusters of precious jewels decorating His crown and earrings. He wore the Kaustubha gem, the mark of Çrévatsa and a garland of forest flowers. Serving that topmost of all Lords were His personal attendants, headed by Sunanda and Nanda; His cakra and other weapons in their personified forms; His consort potencies Puñöi, Çré, Kérti and Ajä; and all His various mystic powers.",

The most important among them were as follows: Puñöi, the energy for nourishment; Çré, the energy of beauty; Kérti, the energy of reputation; and Ajä, the energy of material creation. All these energies are invested in the administrators of the material world, namely Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu, and in the kings of the heavenly planets, Indra, Candra, Varuëa and the sungod. In other words, all these demigods, being empowered by the Lord with certain energies, engage in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\""
