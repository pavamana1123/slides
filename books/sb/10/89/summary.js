First he entered the court of Lord Brahmä, his father, without offering him any respect. This enraged Brahmä, who suppressed his anger because Bhågu was his son. Next Bhågu went to Lord Çiva, his older brother, who rose from his seat to embrace him. But Bhågu rejected the embrace, calling Çiva a deviant heretic. Just as Çiva was about to kill Bhågu with his trident, Goddess Pärvaté interceded and pacified her husband. Next Bhågu went to Vaikuëöha to test Lord Näräyaëa. Going up to the Lord, who was lying with His head on the lap of the goddess of fortune, Bhågu kicked His chest. But instead of becoming angry, both the Lord and His consort stood up and offered Bhågu respects. \"Welcome,\" said the Lord. \"Please sit down and rest awhile. Kindly forgive us, dear master, for not noticing your arrival.\" When Bhågu went back to the assembly of sages and told them all that had happened, they concluded that Lord Viñëu is certainly supreme."

            "content": "Once in Dvärakä a brähmaëa's wife gave birth to a son who immediately died. The brähmaëa took his dead son to the court of King Ugrasena and berated the King: \"This duplicitous, greedy enemy of brähmaëas has caused my son's death by failing to execute his duties properly!\" The same misfortune continued to befall the brähmaëa, and each time he would bring his dead infant's body to the royal court and berate the King. When the ninth son died at birth, Arjuna happened to hear the brähmaëa's complaint, and he said, \"My lord, I will protect your progeny. And if I fail, I will enter fire to atone for my sin.\""

When Arjuna learned of this, he went to the maternity house and enveloped it with a protective cage of arrows. Arjuna's efforts were to no avail, however, for as soon as the child was born and began to cry, it disappeared into the sky. As the brähmaëa profusely derided Arjuna, the warrior set off for the abode of Yamaräja, the king of death. But Arjuna did not find the brähmaëa's son there, and even after searching throughout the fourteen worlds he could find no trace of the infant."

But just as he was about to do so, Lord Kåñëa stopped him and said, \"I will show you the brähmaëa's sons, so please don't despise yourself like this.\" Lord Kåñëa then took Arjuna onto His transcendental chariot, and the two of them crossed over the seven universal islands with their seven oceans, passed over the Lokäloka mountain range and entered the region of dense darkness. Since the horses could not find their way, Kåñëa sent His blazing Sudarçana disc ahead to pierce the gloom. Gradually they came to the water of the Causal Ocean, within which they found the city of Lord Mahä-Viñëu. There they saw the thousand-hooded serpent Ananta and upon Him lay Mahä-Viñëu. The great Lord greeted Çré Kåñëa and Arjuna, saying \"I brought the brähmaëa's sons here simply because I wanted to see the two of you. Please continue to benefit the people in general by exemplifying religious behavior in your forms of Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi.\""

Having directly experienced the greatness of Çré Kåñëa, Arjuna was amazed. He concluded that only by the Lord's mercy can a living being exhibit any power or opulence."
