Bhågu Muni's first offense, committed toward Lord Brahmä, was an offense with the mind. His second offense, committed toward Lord Çiva by insulting him, criticizing him for unclean habits, was an offense by speech. Because the quality of ignorance is prominent in Lord Çiva, when he heard Bhågu's insult, his eyes immediately became red with anger. With uncontrollable rage, he took up his trident and prepared to kill Bhågu Muni. At that time Lord Çiva's wife, Pärvaté, was present. Her personality, like Lord Siva's, is a mixture of the three qualities, and therefore she is called Triguëa-mayé. In this case, she saved the situation by evoking Lord Çiva's quality of goodness.\""
