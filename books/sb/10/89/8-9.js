    "translation": "There he went up to the Supreme Lord, who was lying with His head on the lap of His consort, Çré, and kicked Him on the chest. The Lord then rose, along with Goddess Lakñmé, as a sign of respect. Coming down from His bedstead, that supreme goal of all pure devotees bowed His head to the floor before the sage and told him, ‘Welcome, brähmaëa. Please sit in this chair and rest awhile. Kindly forgive us, dear master, for not noticing your arrival’.",

Not only was Lord Viñëu taking rest, but He was lying with His head in His wife's lap. For Bhågu to strike Him in this position—and not with his hand but with his foot—was worse than any other offense Bhågu could have imagined."

A brähmaëa is to be excused even if he sometimes commits an offense, and Lord Viñëu set the example. Yet it is said that from the time of this incident, the goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, has not been very favorably disposed toward the brähmaëas, and therefore because the goddess of fortune withholds her benedictions from them, the brähmaëas are generally very poor.\""
