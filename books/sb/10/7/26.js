            "content": "Here is a competition in yogic power between Kåñëa and Tåëävartäsura. By practicing mystic yoga, asuras generally attain some perfection in the eight siddhis, or perfections, namely aëimä, laghimä, mahimä, präpti, präkämya, éçitva, vaçitva and kämävasäyitä. But although a demon may acquire such powers to a very limited extent, he cannot compete with the mystic power of Kåñëa, for Kåñëa is Yogeçvara, the source of all mystic power (yatra yogeçvaro hariù ). No one can compete with Kåñëa. Sometimes, of course, having acquired a fragmental portion of Kåñëa's mystic power, asuras demonstrate their power to the foolish public and assert themselves to be God, not knowing that God is the supreme Yogeçvara. Here also we see that Tåëävarta assumed the mahimä-siddhi and took Kåñëa away as if Kåñëa were an ordinary child. But Kåñëa also became a mystic mahimä-siddha. When mother Yaçodä was carrying Him, He became so heavy that His mother, who was usually accustomed to carrying Him, could not bear Him and had to place Him down on the ground. Thus Tåëävarta had been able to take Kåñëa away in the presence of mother Yaçodä. But when Kåñëa, high in the sky, assumed the mahimä-siddhi, the demon, unable to go further, was obliged to stop his force and come down according to Kåñëa's desire. One should not, therefore, compete with Kåñëa's mystic power."

            "content": "Devotees automatically have all mystic power, but they do not like to compete with Kåñëa. Instead, they fully surrender to Kåñëa, and their yogic power is demonstrated by Kåñëa's mercy. Devotees can show mystic yoga so powerful that a demon could not even dream of it, but they never try to demonstrate it for their personal sense gratification. Whatever they do is for the service of the Lord, and therefore they are always in a position superior to that of the demons. There are many karmés, yogés and jïänés who artificially try to compete with Kåñëa, and thus ordinary, foolish people who do not care to hear Çrémad-Bhägavatam from authorities consider some rascal yogé to be Bhagavän, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the present moment there are many so-called bäbäs who present themselves as incarnations of God by showing some insignificant mystic wonder, and foolish people regard them as God because of lacking knowledge of Kåñëa."
