    "translation": "Lord Çré Kåñëa was lying down underneath the handcart in one corner of the courtyard, and although His little legs were as soft as leaves, when He struck the cart with His legs, it turned over violently and collapsed. The wheels separated from the axle, the hubs and spokes fell apart, and the pole of the handcart broke. On the cart there were many little utensils made of various metals, and all of them scattered hither and thither.",

When Lord Kåñëa was of a very tender age, His hands and legs resembled soft new leaves, yet simply by touching the handcart with His legs, He made the cart fall to pieces. It was quite possible for Him to act in this way and yet not exert Himself very much. The Lord in His Vämana avatära had to extend His foot to the greatest height to penetrate the covering of the universe, and when the Lord killed the gigantic demon Hiraëyakaçipu, He had to assume the special bodily feature of Nåsiàhadeva. But in His Kåñëa avatära, the Lord did not need to exert such energy. Therefore, kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam:  Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. In other incarnations, the Lord had to exert some energy according to the time and circumstances, but in this form He exhibited unlimited potency. Thus the handcart collapsed, its joints broken, and all the metal pots and utensils scattered."

The Lord simultaneously pushed the demon to the earth and superficially broke the handcart."
