    "translation": "Feeling the child to be as heavy as the entire universe and therefore being anxious, thinking that perhaps the child was being attacked by some other ghost or demon, the astonished mother Yaçodä put the child down on the ground and began to think of Näräyaëa. Foreseeing disturbances, she called for the brähmaëas to counteract this heaviness, and then she engaged in her other household affairs. She had no alternative than to remember the lotus feet of Näräyaëa, for she could not understand that Kåñëa was the original source of everything.",

As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä , mayä tatam idaà sarvaà jagad avyakta-mürtinä: Kåñëa is everywhere in His impersonal form, and everything rests upon Him. Nonetheless, na cähaà teñv avasthitaù: Kåñëa is not everywhere. Mother Yaçodä was unable to understand this philosophy because she was dealing with Kåñëa as His real mother by the arrangement of yogamäyä. Not understanding the importance of Kåñëa, she could only seek shelter of Näräyaëa for Kåñëa's safety and call the brähmaëas to counteract the situation."
