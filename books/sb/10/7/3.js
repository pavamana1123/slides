The Supreme Personality of Godhead incarnates at different times in different planets and universes, and according to the nature of those places, He exhibits His unlimited potency. That a child sitting on the lap of his mother was able to kill the gigantic Pütanä is extremely wonderful for the inhabitants of this planet, but on other planets the inhabitants are more advanced, and therefore the pastimes the Lord performs there are still more wonderful. Kåñëa's appearance on this planet like a human being makes us more fortunate than the demigods in the higher planets, and therefore Mahäräja Parékñit was very much interested in hearing about Him."
