    "translation": "The liberal mother Yaçodä, absorbed in celebrating the utthäna ceremony, was busy receiving guests, worshiping them with all respect and offering them clothing, cows, garlands and grains. Thus she could not hear the child crying for His mother. At that time, the child Kåñëa, demanding to drink the milk of His mother's breast, angrily threw His legs upward.",

            "content": "Kåñëa had been placed underneath a household handcart, but this handcart was actually another form of the Çakaöäsura, a demon who had come there to kill the child. Now, on the plea of demanding to suck His mother's breast, Kåñëa took this opportunity to kill the demon. Thus He kicked Çakaöäsura just to expose him. Although Kåñëa's mother was engaged in receiving guests, Lord Kåñëa wanted to draw her attention by killing the Çakaöäsura, and therefore he kicked that cart-shaped demon. Such are the pastimes of Kåñëa. Kåñëa wanted to draw the attention of His mother, but while doing so He created a great havoc not understandable by ordinary persons. These narrations are wonderfully enjoyable, and those who are fortunate are struck with wonder upon hearing of these extraordinary activities of the Lord. Although the less intelligent regard them as mythological because a dull brain cannot understand them, they are real facts. These narrations are actually so enjoyable and enlightening that Mahäräja Parékñit and Çukadeva Gosvämé took pleasure in them, and other liberated persons, following in their footsteps, become fully jubilant by hearing about the wonderful activities of the Lord."
