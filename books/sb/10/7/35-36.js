            "content": "By the arrangement of yogamäyä, Kåñëa's pastimes with mother Yaçodä were all regarded as ordinary. So here was an opportunity for Kåñëa to show His mother that the whole universe is situated within Him. In His small form, Kåñëa was kind enough to show His mother the viräö-rüpa, the universal form, so that she could enjoy seeing what kind of child she had on her lap. The rivers have been mentioned here as the daughters of the mountains (nagäàs tad-duhitṟù). It is the flowing of the rivers that makes big forests possible. There are living entities everywhere, some of them moving and some of them not moving. No place is vacant. This is a special feature of God's creation."
