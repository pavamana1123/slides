    "translation": "When the force of the dust storm and the winds subsided, Yaçodä's friends, the other gopés, approached mother Yaçodä, hearing her pitiful crying. Not seeing Kåñëa present, they too felt very much aggrieved and joined mother Yaçodä in crying, their eyes full of tears.",

When Kåñëa was there they were happy, and when Kåñëa was not there, they were unhappy. Thus when mother Yaçodä was lamenting Kåñëa's absence, the other ladies also began to cry."
