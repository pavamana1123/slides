When Çré Kåñëa was only three months old and was just trying to turn backside up, before He even attempted to crawl, mother Yaçodä wanted to observe a ritualistic ceremony with her friends for the good fortune of the child. Such a ritualistic ceremony is generally performed with ladies who also have small children. When mother Yaçodä saw that Kåñëa was falling asleep, because of other engagements she put the child underneath a household cart, called çakaöa, and while the child was sleeping, she engaged herself in other business pertaining to the auspicious ritualistic ceremony. Underneath the cart was a cradle, and mother Yaçodä placed the child in that cradle. The child was sleeping, but suddenly He awakened and, as usual for a child, began to kick His small legs. This kicking shook the cart, which collapsed with a great sound, breaking completely and spilling all its contents. Children who were playing nearby immediately informed mother Yaçodä that the cart had broken, and therefore she hastily arrived there in great anxiety with the other gopés. Mother Yaçodä immediately took the child on her lap and allowed Him to suck her breast. Then various types of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies were performed with the help of the brähmaëas. Not knowing the real identity of the child, the brähmaëas showered the child with blessings."

            "content": "Another day, when mother Yaçodä was sitting with her child on her lap, she suddenly observed that he had assumed the weight of the entire universe. She was so astonished that she had to put the child down, and in the meantime Tåëävarta, one of the servants of Kaàsa, appeared there as a whirlwind and took the child away. The whole tract of land known as Gokula became surcharged with dust, no one could see where the child had been taken, and all the gopés were overwhelmed because He had been taken away in the dust storm. But up in the sky, the asura, being overburdened by the child, could not carry the child far away, although he also could not drop the child because the child had caught him so tightly that it was difficult for him to separate the child from his body. Thus Tåëävarta himself fell down from a very great height, the child grasping him tightly by the shoulder, and immediately died. The demon having fallen, the gopés picked the child up and delivered Him to the lap of mother Yaçodä. Thus mother Yaçodä was struck with wonder, but because of yogamäyä's influence, no one could understand who Kåñëa was and what had actually happened. Rather, everyone began to praise fortune for the child's having been saved from such a calamity. Nanda Mahäräja, of course, was thinking of the wonderful foretelling of Vasudeva and began to praise him as a great yogé. Later, when the child was on the lap of mother Yaçodä, the child yawned, and mother Yaçodä could see within His mouth the entire universal manifestation."
