    "translation": "It is most astonishing that although this innocent child was taken away by the Räkñasa to be eaten, He has returned without having been killed or even injured. Because this demon was envious, cruel and sinful, he has been killed for his own sinful activities. This is the law of nature. An innocent devotee is always protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and a sinful person is always vanquished for his sinful life.",

As confirmed by Kåñëa in Bhagavad-gétä , bhajate mäà ananya-bhäk sädhur eva sa mantavyaù: anyone fully attached to Kåñëa is a sädhu. Nanda Mahäräja and the gopés and other cowherd men could not understand that Kåñëa was the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing as a human child and that His life was not in danger under any circumstances. Rather, because of their intense parental love for Kåñëa, they thought that Kåñëa was an innocent child and had been saved by the Supreme Lord."

Therefore the quality of fear is one of the aspects of material life (ähära-nidrä-bhaya-maithunaà ca). But if one becomes Kåñëa conscious, the process of devotional service, çravaëaà kértanam . In devotional life, one has faith in this process. Such faith is one of the six kinds of surrender. Rakñiñyatéti viçväsaù (Hari-bhakti-viläsa 11.676). One of the processes of surrender is that one should simply depend on Kåñëa, convinced that He will give one all protection. That Kåñëa will protect His devotee is a fact, and Nanda Mahäräja and the other inhabitants of Våndävana accepted this very simply, although they did not know that the Supreme Lord Himself was present before them. There have been many instances in which a devotee like Prahläda Mahäräja or Dhruva Mahäräja has been put in difficulty even by his father but has been saved under all circumstances. Therefore our only business is to become Kåñëa conscious and depend fully on Kåñëa for all protection."
