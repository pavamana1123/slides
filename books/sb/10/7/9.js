    "translation": "The assembled cowherd men and ladies began to contemplate how this thing had happened. \"Is it the work of some demon or evil planet?\" they asked. At that time, the small children present asserted that the cart had been kicked apart by the baby Kåñëa. As soon as the crying baby bad kicked the cart's wheel, the cart had collapsed. There was no doubt about it.",

The Çakaöäsura was a ghost who had taken shelter of the handcart and was looking for the opportunity to do mischief to Kåñëa. When Kåñëa kicked the cart with His small and very delicate legs, the ghost was immediately pushed down to the earth and his shelter dismantled, as already described. This was possible for Kåñëa because He has full potency, as confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38):"

Such are the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord does not need to acquire these potencies; He already has them. Thus Kåñëa kicked His little legs, and His whole purpose was fulfilled. Also, when the handcart broke, an ordinary child could have been injured in many ways, but because Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He enjoyed the dismantling of the cart, and nothing injured Him. Everything done by Him is änanda-cinmaya-rasa, full transcendental bliss. Thus Kåñëa factually enjoyed."

By the arrangement of yogamäyä, all the gopés and gopas thought that the accident had taken place because of some bad planet or some ghost, but in fact everything was done by Kåñëa and enjoyed by Him. Those who enjoy the activities of Kåñëa are also on the platform of änanda-cinmaya-rasa; they are liberated from the material platform. When one develops the practice of hearing kåñëa-kathä, he is certainly transcendental to material existence, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (sa guëän samatétyaitän brahma-bhüyäya kalpate ). Unless one is on the spiritual platform, one cannot enjoy the transcendental activities of Kåñëa; or in other words, whoever engages in hearing the transcendental activities of Kåñëa is not on the material platform, but on the transcendental, spiritual platform."
