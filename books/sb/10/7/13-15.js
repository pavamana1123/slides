    "translation": "When brähmaëas are free from envy, untruthfulness, unnecessary pride, grudges, disturbance by the opulence of others, and false prestige, their blessings never go in vain. Considering this, Nanda Mahäräja soberly took Kåñëa on his lap and invited such truthful brähmaëas to perform a ritualistic ceremony according to the holy hymns of the Säma Veda, Åg Veda and Yajur Veda. Then, while the hymns were being chanted, he bathed the child with water mixed with pure herbs, and after performing a fire ceremony, he sumptuously fed all the brähmaëas with first-class grains and other food.",

He was fully confident that simply if the good brähmaëas showered their blessings, the child Kåñëa would be happy. The blessings of qualified brähmaëas can bring happiness not only to Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but to everyone. Because Kåñëa is self-sufficient, He does not require anyone's blessings, yet Nanda Mahäräja thought that Kåñëa required the blessings of the brähmaëas. What then is to be said of others? In human society, therefore, there must be an ideal class of men, brähmaëas, who can bestow blessings upon others, namely, upon the kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras, so that everyone will be happy. Kåñëa therefore says in Bhagavad-gétä  that human society must have four social orders (cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù); it is not that everyone should become a çüdra or a vaiçya and human society will prosper. As enunciated in Bhagavad-gétä, there must be a class of brähmaëas with qualities like satya (truthfulness), çama (peacefulness), dama (self-control) and titikñä (tolerance)."

There may be caste brähmaëas, and we have all respect for them, but their birth in brähmaëa families does not mean that they are qualified to bestow blessings upon the other members of human society. This is the verdict of the çästras. In Kali-yuga, caste brähmaëas are accepted as brähmaëas. Vipratve sütram eva hi , yasya yal lakñaëaà proktam. The symptoms of a brähmaëa are stated in çästra, and one must be qualified with these symptoms."

Therefore a class of men must be trained as brähmaëas from the very beginning. Brahmacäré guru-kule vasan dänto guror hitam  then he becomes a Vaiñëava. In this age, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura introduced the sacred thread ceremony for his Vaiñëava disciples, with the idea that people should understand that when one becomes a Vaiñëava he has already acquired the qualifications of a brähmaëa. Therefore in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, those who are twice initiated so as to become brähmaëas must bear in mind their great responsibility to be truthful, control the mind and senses, be tolerant, and so on. Then their life will be successful. It was such brähmaëas that Nanda Mahäräja invited to chant the Vedic hymns, not ordinary brähmaëas. Verse thirteen distinctly mentions hiàsä-mäna. The word mäna refers to false prestige or false pride. Those who were falsely proud, thinking that they were brähmaëas because they were born in brähmaëa families, were never invited by Nanda Mahäräja on such occasions."

Sometimes there were nimba leaves, sometimes bael leaves, mango leaves, açvattha leaves or ämalaké leaves. Similarly, there were païca-gavya, païca-çasya and païca-ratna. Although Nanda Mahäräja belonged to the vaiçya community, everything was known to him."

            "content": "The most important word in these verses is mahä-guëam, indicating that the brähmaëas were offered very palatable food of exalted quality. Such palatable dishes were generally prepared with two things, namely food grains and milk products. Bhagavad-gétä .) Then the prasäda is distributed. Even today in Jagannätha-kñetra and other big temples, very palatable dishes are offered to the Deity, and prasäda is distributed profusely. Cooked by first-class brähmaëas with expert knowledge and then distributed to the public, this prasäda is also a blessing from the brähmaëas or Vaiñëavas. There are four kinds of prasäda (catur-vidha). Salty, sweet, sour and pungent tastes are made with different types of spices, and the food is prepared in four divisions, called carvya, cüñya, lehya and peya-prasäda that is chewed, prasäda that is licked, prasäda tasted with the tongue, and prasäda that is drunk. Thus there are many varieties of prasäda, prepared very nicely with grains and ghee, offered to the Deity and distributed to the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas and then to the general public. This is the way of human society. Killing the cows and spoiling the land will not solve the problem of food. This is not civilization. Uncivilized men living in the jungle and being unqualified to produce food by agriculture and cow protection may eat animals, but a perfect human society advanced in knowledge must learn how to produce first-class food simply by agriculture and protection of cows."
