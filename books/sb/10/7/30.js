Not at all disturbed because of being taken high in the sky by the demon, Kåñëa was playing and enjoying. This is änanda-cinmaya-rasa-vigraha. In any condition, Kåñëa is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1). He has no unhappiness. Others might have thought that He was in difficulty, but because the demon's chest was sufficiently broad to play on, the baby was happy in all respects. It was most astonishing that although the demon went so high in the sky, the child did not fall down. Therefore, the child had been saved virtually from the mouth of death. Now that He was saved, all the inhabitants of Våndävana were happy."
