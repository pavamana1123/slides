She did not appreciate the wonders shown by her child; rather, she wanted to close her eyes. She was expecting another danger, and therefore her eyes became restless like those of a deer cub. This was all the arrangement of yogamäyä. The relationship between mother Yaçodä and Kåñëa is one of pure maternal love. In that love, mother Yaçodä did not very much appreciate the display of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's opulences."
