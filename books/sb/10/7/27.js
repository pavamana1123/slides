    "translation": "Because of Kåñëa's weight, Tåëävarta considered Him to be like a great mountain or a hunk of iron. But because Kåñëa had caught the demon's neck, the demon was unable to throw Him off. He therefore thought of the child as wonderful, since he could neither bear the child nor cast aside the burden.",

Thus Tåëävarta's attempt to kill Kåñëa failed, while Kåñëa, änanda-cinmaya-rasa-vigraha, enjoyed this pastime. Now, since Tåëävarta was falling because of Kåñëa's heaviness, he wanted to save himself by throwing Kåñëa off from his neck, but was unable to do so because Kåñëa held him very tightly. Consequently, this would be the last time for Tåëävarta's yogic power. Now he was going to die by the arrangement of Kåñëa."
