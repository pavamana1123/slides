Yaçodä used to do this, but this time Kåñëa became very heavy, and she could not bear His weight. Under the circumstances, it is to be understood that Kåñëa was aware of the coming of Tåëävartäsura, who would take Him far away from His mother. Kåñëa knew that when Tåëävarta came and took Him away from His mother's lap, mother Yaçodä would be greatly bereaved. He did not want His mother to suffer any difficulty from the demon. Therefore, because He is the source of everything (janmädy asya yataù ), He assumed the heaviness of the entire universe. The child was on the lap of Yaçodä, who was therefore in possession of everything in the world, but when the child assumed such heaviness, she had to put Him down in order to give Tåëävartäsura an opportunity to take Him away and play with Him for some time before the child returned to the lap of His mother."
