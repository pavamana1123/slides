    "translation": "King Parékñit said: My lord, Çukadeva Gosvämé, all the various activities exhibited by the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are certainly pleasing to the ear and to the mind. Simply by one's hearing of these activities, the dirty things in one's mind immediately vanish. Generally we are reluctant to hear about the activities of the Lord, but Kåñëa's childhood activities are so attractive that they are automatically pleasing to the mind and ear. Thus one's attachment for hearing about material things, which is the root cause of material existence, vanishes, and one gradually develops devotional service to the Supreme Lord, attachment for Him, and friendship with devotees who give us the contribution of Kåñëa consciousness. If you think it fit, kindly speak about those activities of the Lord.",

Çrémad-Bhägavatam and other Vedic literatures exist simply to give us a chance to hear about Kåñëa. Kåñëa has different avatäras, or incarnations, all of which are wonderful and which arouse one's inquisitiveness, but generally such avatäras as Matsya, Kürma and Varäha are not as attractive as Kåñëa. First of all, however, we have no attraction for hearing about Kåñëa, and this is the root cause of our suffering."

            "content": "But Parékñit Mahäräja specifically mentions that the wonderful activities of baby Kåñëa, which amazed mother Yaçodä and the other inhabitants of Vraja, are especially attractive. From the very beginning of His childhood, Kåñëa killed Pütanä, Tåëävarta and Çakaöäsura and showed the entire universe within His mouth. Thus the pastimes of Kåñëa, one after another, kept mother Yaçodä and all the inhabitants of Vraja in great astonishment. The process to revive one's Kåñëa consciousness is ädau çraddhä tataù sädhu-saìgaù (Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.4.15). The pastimes of Kåñëa can be properly received from devotees. If one has developed a little bit of Kåñëa consciousness by hearing from Vaiñëavas about the activities of Kåñëa, one becomes attached to Vaiñëavas who are interested only in Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore Parékñit Mahäräja recommends that one hear about Kåñëa's childhood activities, which are more attractive than the activities of other incarnations, such as Matsya, Kürma and Varäha. Wanting to hear more and more from Çukadeva Gosvämé, Mahäräja Parékñit requested him to continue describing Kåñëa's childhood activities, which are especially easy to hear and which create more and more inquisitiveness."
