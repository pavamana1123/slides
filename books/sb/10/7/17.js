Because in this age there are no qualified brähmaëas, people should perform yajïa by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra (yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù). Life is meant for yajïa, and yajïa is performed by the chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare."
