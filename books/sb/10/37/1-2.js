    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: The demon Keçé, sent by Kaàsa, appeared in Vraja as a great horse. Running with the speed of the mind, he tore up the earth with his hooves. The hairs of his mane scattered the clouds and the demigods' airplanes throughout the sky, and he terrified everyone present with his loud neighing.When the Supreme Personality of Godhead saw how the demon was frightening His village of Gokula by neighing terribly and shaking the clouds with his tail, the Lord came forward to meet him. Keçé was searching for Kåñëa to fight, so when the Lord stood before him and challenged him to approach, the horse responded by roaring like a lion.",
