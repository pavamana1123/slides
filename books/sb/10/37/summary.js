As he approached, his loud neighing terrified all the inhabitants, and they began looking for Çré Kåñëa. When He saw the demon, Kåñëa came forward and challenged him to come near. Keçé charged Kåñëa and tried to strike Him with his front legs, but the Lord seized them, whirled the demon around several times, and then threw him a distance of one hundred bow-lengths. Keçé remained unconscious for some time. When the demon regained consciousness, he furiously charged Kåñëa again, his mouth agape. The Lord then thrust His left arm into the horse demon's mouth, and as Keçé tried to bite the arm, it felt like a red-hot iron rod. Kåñëa's arm expanded more and more, finally choking the demon, and in extreme agony Keçé gave up his life. Lord Kåñëa then removed His arm. He stood calmly, showing no pride at having killed the demon, as the demigods showered down flowers from the sky and glorified the Lord with prayers."

            "content": "One day, while tending the cows, Kåñëa, Balaräma and the cowherd boys became engrossed in playing hide-and-go-seek. Some of the boys took the role of sheep, some the role of thieves, and others shepherds. The shepherds would search for the sheep when the thieves stole them. Taking advantage of this game, a demon named Vyoma, sent by Kaàsa, dressed himself like a cowherd boy and joined the band of \"thieves.\" He abducted a few cowherd boys at a time and threw them into a mountain cave, keeping them there by blocking the entrance with a boulder. Gradually Vyomäsura abducted all but four or five cowherd boys. When Kåñëa saw what the demon was doing, He ran after him, grabbed him and killed him just as one would kill a sacrificial animal."
