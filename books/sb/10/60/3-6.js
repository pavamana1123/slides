    "translation": "Queen Rukmiëé's quarters were extremely beautiful, boasting a canopy hung with brilliant strings of pearls, as well as effulgent jewels serving as lamps. Garlands of jasmine and other flowers hung here and there, attracting swarms of humming bees, and the spotless rays of the moon shone through the holes of the lattice windows. As aguru incense drifted out of the window holes, my dear King, the breeze wafting the scent of the pärijäta grove carried the mood of a garden into the room. There the Queen served her husband, the Supreme Lord of all the worlds, as He reclined upon an opulent pillow on her bed, which was as soft and white as the foam of milk.",

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté adds that the word amalaiù in this verse may also be read aruëaiù, which would indicate that when this pastime took place the moon had just risen, bathing the entire palace in beautiful ruddy moonshine."
