Only when I gave her a whole pärijäta tree was she satisfied. Rukmiëé, however, did not display any anger even when she saw Me give Satyabhämä the whole tree. So how can I enjoy the nectar of angry words from this wife, who never feels jealousy, who is supremely sober and who always speaks pleasingly?' Thus considering, the Supreme Lord decided, 'If I speak like this to her, I will be able to provoke her anger.' This is how some authorities explain Kåñëa's speech to Rukmiëé.\""

            "content": "According to the äcärya, here the words balavadbhiù kåta-dveñän präyaù indicate that Lord Kåñëa opposed almost all the contemporary kings during His incarnation, befriending only a few, such as the Päëòavas and loyal members of His dynasty. Of course, as stated in the beginning of the Tenth Canto, Lord Kåñëa appeared specifically because the earth was overburdened by innumerable bogus kings and He wanted to remove this burden."
