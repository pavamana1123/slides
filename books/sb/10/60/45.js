    "translation": "A woman who fails to relish the fragrance of the honey of Your lotus feet becomes totally befooled, and thus she accepts as her husband or lover a living corpse covered with skin, whiskers, nails, head-hair and body-hair and filled with flesh, bones, blood, parasites, feces, mucus, bile and air.",

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments as follows on this verse: On the authority of the statement sa vai patiù syäd akuto-bhayaù svayam—\"He indeed should become one's husband who can remove all fear\"—Çré Kåñëa is the real husband for all women at all times. Thus a woman who worships someone else as her husband simply worships a dead body."

An ordinary husband's body is covered on the outside by skin and hair; otherwise, being filled with blood, feces, flesh, bile and so on, it would be overwhelmed with flies and other vermin attracted by its bad smell and other offensive qualities."
