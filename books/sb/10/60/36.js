Even if such people are \"culturally advanced,\" they should simply be considered sophisticated or polished animals. Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé points out that because the Lord's activities are always transcendental, they are aspañöa, or \"unclear,\" to ordinary people, and even the sages trying to know the Lord cannot perfectly understand these activities."
