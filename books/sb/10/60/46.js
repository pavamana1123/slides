            "content": "Here, however, Queen Rukmiëé humbly identifies herself with the Lord's external energy, which is her expansion. Therefore she says, \"Though You do not often look at me, when You are ready to manifest the material universe and thus begin to work through the material quality of passion, which is Your potency, You glance at me. In this way You show me Your greatest mercy.\" Thus Äcärya Viçvanätha explains that Goddess Rukmiëé's statement can be understood in two ways. And of course the Vaiñëavas, after thoroughly understanding the philosophy of Kåñëa from the bona fide äcäryas, simply relish these loving affairs between the Lord and His exalted devotees."
