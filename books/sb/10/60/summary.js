Rukmiëé always responded to Çré Kåñëa's moods, whatever they might be. On this occasion the Lord looked at Rukmiëé, whose beauty was faultless, and began to tease her: \"Previously many wealthy kings, worthy of you in their appearance and character, wanted to marry you. In fact, your father and brother intended to give you in marriage to Çiçupäla. Why, then, did you accept such an unsuitable husband as Me, who once renounced My kingdom and fled to the sea in fear of Jaräsandha? Besides, I transgress worldly morality, and because I own nothing I am dear to other paupers. Certainly the well-to-do would not worship one such as Me."

But out of shortsightedness you have accepted a husband who lacks every good quality and is glorified by beggars. Better you had married some prominent warrior; then you might have been happy in this life and the next. Your brother Rukmé and kings like Çiçupäla all hate Me, and it was only to cut down their pride that I kidnapped you. But as for such things as body, home, wife and children, I'm indifferent to them, being the self-satisfied Personality of Godhead, transcendental to all material affairs.\""

She began to cry, and soon she became stunned in extreme fear, pain and sadness and fell unconscious. Lord Kåñëa saw that she had misunderstood His joking, and thus He felt compassion for her. He picked her up from the floor and, caressing her face, consoled her: \"I know you are totally attached to Me. It was only out of eagerness to see your lotus face adorned with a frown that I teased you. To joke with one's beloved is the highest enjoyment for householders.\" These words dispelled Rukmiëé's fear of rejection. Seeing that Kåñëa had spoken only in jest, she said, \"What You said about the two of us being mismatched is actually true. After all, no one is equal to You, the omnipotent master of the three principal deities-Brahmä, Viñëu and Çiva.\" Rukmiëé went on to show how everything Kåñëa had said denigrating Himself was actually glorification."

Anyone who prays to Me for sense gratification and happiness in family life is simply deluded by My illusory energy, Mäyä. Such a person will take a low birth. Ordinary women with corrupt desires cannot possibly worship Me faithfully, as you have done. At the time of your marriage you showed no interest in any of the royal suitors; rather, you sent a brähmaëa messenger for Me. Thus you are certainly the most beloved of all My consorts.\""
