The Lord said, ästhitäù padavéà su-bhru präyaù sédanti yoñitaù: \"Women who follow My path generally suffer.\" Here Rukmiëé-devé says, sédanti te 'nupadavéà ta ihästhitäù kim: \"Why should those fixed on Your path suffer in this world?\" She gives the example of many great kings who renounced their powerful sovereignty to enter the forest, where they performed austerities and worshiped the Lord, intensely desiring His transcendental association. Thus, according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé here intends to tell Çré Kåñëa, \"You have said that I, a king's daughter, am unintelligent and frustrated because I married You. But how can You accuse all these great enlightened kings of being unintelligent? They were the wisest of men, yet they gave up everything to follow You and were certainly not frustrated by the result. Indeed, they achieved the perfection of Your association.\""
