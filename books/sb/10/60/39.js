    "translation": "Knowing that great sages who have renounced the sannyäsé's daëòa proclaim Your glories, that You are the Supreme Soul of all the worlds, and that You are so gracious that You give away even Your own self, I chose You as my husband, rejecting Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and the rulers of heaven, whose aspirations are all frustrated by the force of time, which is born from Your eyebrows. What interest, then, could I have in any other suitors?",

There the Lord Kåñëa said, bhikñubhiù çläghitä mudhä: \"I am glorified by beggars.\" But Queen Rukmiëé points out that those so-called beggars are actually sages in the paramahaàsa stage of life—sannyäsés who have reached the highest level of spiritual advancement and thus given up the sannyäsé rod. Lord Kåñëa also made two specific accusations against His wife in Text 16. He said, vaidarbhy etad avijïäya—\"My dear Vaidarbhé, you were not aware of the situation\"—and tvayädérgha-samékñayä—\"because you lack foresight.\" In the present verse, Rukmiëé's statement iti me våto 'si indicates \"I chose You as my husband because You possess the above-mentioned qualities. It was not a blind choice at all.\" Rukmiëé further mentions that she passed over lesser personalities like Brahmä, Çiva and the rulers of heaven because she saw that even though, materially speaking, they are great personalities, they are frustrated by the powerful waves of time, which emanate from the eyebrows of Lord Kåñëa. Therefore, far from lacking foresight, Rukmiëé chose Lord Kåñëa after an exhaustive appraisal of the entire cosmic situation. Thus she lovingly rebukes her husband here."
