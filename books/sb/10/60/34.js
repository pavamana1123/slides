    "translation": "Çré Rukmiëé said: Actually, what You have said is true, O lotus-eyed one. I am indeed unsuitable for the almighty Personality of Godhead. What comparison is there between that Supreme Lord, who is master of the three primal deities and who delights in His own glory, and myself, a woman of mundane qualities whose feet are grasped by fools?",

These include incompatibility, fearfulness, taking shelter in the ocean, quarreling with the powerful, abandoning His kingdom, uncertainty as to His identity, acting against ordinary standards of behavior, having no good qualities, being praised falsely by beggars, aloofness, and lack of desire for family life. The Lord claimed that Rukmiëé had failed to recognize these bad qualities in Him. Now she begins to respond to all the Lord's statements."

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté further points out that in her extreme humility Rukmiëé is identifying herself with the Lord's external energy, which in fact is her expansion, Rukmiëé being the goddess of fortune."
