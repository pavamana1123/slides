    "translation": "My Lord, as a lion drives away lesser animals to claim his proper tribute, You drove off the assembled kings with the resounding twang of Your Çärìga bow and then claimed me, Your fair share. Thus it is sheer foolishness, my dear Gadägraja, for You to say You took shelter in the ocean out of fear of those kings.",

She states, \"Like a lion You abducted me in the presence of those kings and drove them away with Your Çärìga bow, so it is simply foolishness to say that out of fear of those same kings You went to the ocean.\" According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, as Queen Rukmiëé spoke these words she frowned and cast angry sidelong glances at the Lord."
