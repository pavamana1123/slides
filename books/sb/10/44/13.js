They want to indicate that in Våndävana Kåñëa simply enjoys with His girlfriends and boyfriends, whereas here in Mathurä the Lord is subjected to harassment by the bullying tactics of professional wrestlers. Thus the ladies are condemning the city of Mathurä because of their pain at seeing Kåñëa in what they consider an unfair wrestling match. Of course, Mathurä is also one of the Lord's eternal abodes, but here the women in the assembly express their love in a critical mood."
