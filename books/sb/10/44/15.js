    "translation": "The ladies of Vraja are the most fortunate of women because, with their minds fully attached to Kåñëa and their throats always choked up with tears, they constantly sing about Him while milking the cows, winnowing grain, churning butter, gathering cow dung for fuel, riding on swings, taking care of their crying babies, sprinkling the ground with water, cleaning their houses, and so on. By their exalted Kåñëa consciousness they automatically acquire all desirable things.",
