Battling arm to arm, head to head, knee to knee and chest to chest, the opponents attacked each other so fiercely that they appeared to be harming even their own bodies. The ladies in the arena, seeing the violent battle, began to condemn the King and all the members of the assembly: \"A respectable audience should never have allowed a wrestling match between such huge wrestlers, whose limbs are as tough as lightning bolts, and such tender young boys, who are just entering youth. An intelligent person should never enter an assembly if he sees injustice being done there.\" Because Vasudeva and Devaké did not fully understand the power of Kåñëa and Balaräma, they became extremely unhappy when they heard the women of the audience speak these words."

Muñöika met a similar fate: after being struck powerfully by Lord Baladeva's palm, he began vomiting blood and then fell down dead. Thereupon the wrestlers named Küöa, Çala and Toçala came forward, but Kåñëa and Balaräma easily killed them with the blows of Their fists and feet. The remaining wrestlers, fearing for their lives, all fled."

The King, in a rage, stopped the festive music and ordered that Vasudeva, Nanda, Ugrasena and all the cowherds be severely punished and that Kåñëa and Balaräma be driven from the assembly. Kåñëa became furious when He heard Kaàsa speak this way, and He instantly leapt onto the lofty royal dais. He grabbed Kaàsa by the hair, hurled him down onto the floor of the wrestling ring and threw Himself on top of him. In this way, Kaàsa met his death. Because out of fear Kaàsa had always thought of Kåñëa, after his death he gained the liberation of having a form like the Lord's."

The Lord consoled the widows, had the funeral rites performed for Kaàsa and his brothers and then released His mother and father from bondage. Kåñëa offered obeisances at His parents' feet, but they, now understanding Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, did not embrace Him."
