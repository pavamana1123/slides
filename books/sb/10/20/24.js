When the Vedic followers, the brähmaëas, inspire rich men like kings and the wealthy mercantile community to give charity in the performance of great sacrifices, the distribution of such wealth is also nectarean. The four sections of human society, namely the brähmaëas, the kñatriyas, the vaiçyas and the çüdras, are meant to live peacefully in a cooperative mood; this is possible when they are guided by expert Vedic brähmaëas who perform sacrifices and distribute wealth equally.\""
