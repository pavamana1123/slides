Before becoming students, they were dirty-looking, although they had naturally beautiful personal features; but due to having no information of Kåñëa consciousness they appeared very dirty and wretched. Since they have taken to Kåñëa consciousness, their health has improved, and by following the rules and regulations they have increased their bodily luster. When they are dressed with saffron-colored cloth, with tilaka on their foreheads and beads in their hands and on their necks, they look exactly as if they have come directly from Vaikuëöha.\""
