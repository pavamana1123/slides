Although one should not kill a relative, there are extenuating circumstances according to military codes. In the American Civil War, which took place in the 1860's, many families were divided between the army of the North and that of the South, and thus fratricidal killing unfortunately became a common affair. Such killing is certainly ghoratama, most dreadful. Yet such is the nature of the material world, where duty, honor and so-called justice often create conflict. Only on the spiritual platform, in pure Kåñëa consciousness, can we transcend the unacceptable pain of material existence. Rukmé was maddened by pride and envy and thus could not understand anything about Kåñëa or Kåñëa consciousness."
