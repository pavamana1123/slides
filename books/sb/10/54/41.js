All along this was the best arrangement for all concerned, and yet from the beginning Rukmé had maliciously opposed this beautiful arrangement. When his sister's desire was finally fulfilled and she was taken by Kåñëa, he viciously attacked the Lord with vulgar insults and mortal weapons. In return Lord Kåñëa tied him up and partially clipped his hair and mustache. While certainly humiliating for a puffed-up prince like Rukmé, his punishment was a mere slap on the wrist, considering what he had done."
