The Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, desires to share His blissful opulences with all living beings, and thus He sincerely invites them to come back home, back to Godhead. The Kåñëa consciousness movement, introduced throughout the world by Çréla Prabhupäda on the order of his spiritual master, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, who himself preached all over India on the order of his exalted father, Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura, is broadcasting the loving message of Lord Kåñëa: Remember Him, serve Him, return to Him and share in the infinite bounty of the kingdom of God."
