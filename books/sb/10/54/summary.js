Lord Baladeva and the generals of the Yädava army turned to face these opponents, blocking their advance. The enemy armies then began pouring incessant showers of arrows upon Lord Kåñëa's army. Seeing her husband-to-be's forces under such violent attack, Çrématé Rukmiëé looked at Çré Kåñëa fearfully. But Kåñëa simply smiled and told her there was nothing to fear because His army would surely destroy the enemy in short order."

Seventeen times Kåñëa defeated me, but in the end I was victorious over Him. Thus seeing that victory and defeat are under the control of destiny and time, I have learned not to succumb to either lamentation or joy. Time now favors the Yädavas, so they have defeated you with only a small army, but in the future time will favor you, and you will surely conquer them.\" Consoled in this way, Çiçupäla took his followers and returned to his kingdom."

So, after vowing before all the kings present that he would not return to Kuëòina until Kåñëa had been destroyed and Rukmiëé rescued, Rukmé set out with his army to attack the Lord. Ignorant of Lord Kåñëa's glories, Rukmé boldly went out to attack Kåñëa in a lone chariot. He approached the Lord, struck Him with arrows and demanded that He release Rukmiëé. Çré Kåñëa fended off Rukmé's weapons, breaking them to pieces. Then He raised His sword high and was about to kill Rukmé when Rukmiëé interceded and fervently pleaded that her brother's life be spared. Lord Kåñëa did not kill Rukmé, but with His sword He shaved off bits of Rukmé's hair here and there, leaving him disfigured. Just then Lord Baladeva appeared on the scene with the Yädava army. Seeing Rukmé disfigured, He gently reproached Kåñëa: \"To disfigure such a close family member is as good as killing him; therefore he should not be killed but set free.\""

Accepting Lord Balaräma's instructions, Rukmiëé gave up her sorrow."
