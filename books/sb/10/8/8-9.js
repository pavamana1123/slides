    "translation": "Kaàsa is both a great diplomat and a very sinful man. Therefore, having heard from Yogamäyä, the daughter of Devaké, that the child who will kill him has already been born somewhere else, having heard that the eighth pregnancy of Devaké could not bring forth a female child, and having understood your friendship with Vasudeva, Kaàsa, upon hearing that the purificatory process has been performed by me, the priest of the Yadu dynasty, may certainly consider all these points and suspect that Kåñëa is the son of Devaké and Vasudeva. Then he might take steps to kill Kåñëa. That would be a catastrophe.",

Actually this was what had happened. Garga Muni argued very soberly that his taking part in performing the reformatory process for Kåñëa would give rise to many doubts, so that Kaàsa might take very severe steps to kill the child. Kaàsa had already sent many demons to attempt to kill this child, but none of them had survived. If Garga Muni were to perform the purificatory process, Kaàsa's suspicions would be fully confirmed, and he would take very severe steps. Garga Muni gave this warning to Nanda Mahäräja."
