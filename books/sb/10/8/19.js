            "content": "One who equates Näräyaëa even with great exalted demigods like Lord Çiva or Lord Brahmä is a päñaëòé, an agnostic. No one can equal Näräyaëa. Nonetheless, Garga Muni used the word sama, meaning \"equal,\" because he wanted to treat Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who had become Nanda Mahäräja's son. Garga Muni wanted to impress upon the mind of Nanda Mahäräja, \"Your worshipable Deity, Näräyaëa, is so pleased with you that He has sent you a son almost equal to Him in qualifications. Therefore you may designate your son with a similar name, such as Mukunda or Madhusüdana. But you must always remember that whenever you want to do something very good, there will be many hindrances. Therefore you should raise and protect this child with great care. If you can protect this child very cautiously, as Näräyaëa always protects you, the child will be as good as Näräyaëa.\" Garga Muni also indicated that although the child was exaltedly qualified like Näräyaëa, He would enjoy more than Näräyaëa as räsa-vihäré, the central enjoyer of the räsa dance. As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä, lakñmé-sahasra-çata-sambhrama-sevyamänam: (BS 5.29) He would be served by many gopés, who would all be as good as the goddess of fortune."
