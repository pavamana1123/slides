    "translation": "When Kåñëa and Balaräma, with the strength of Their legs, crawled in the muddy places created in Vraja by cow dung and cow urine, Their crawling resembled the crawling of serpents, and the sound of Their ankle bells was very charming. Very much pleased by the sound of other people's ankle bells, They used to follow these people as if going to Their mothers, but when They saw that these were other people, They became afraid and returned to Their real mothers, Yaçodä and Rohiëé.",

Thus They sometimes followed other people, who would enjoy the crawling of Kåñëa and Balaräma and exclaim, \"Oh, see how Kåñëa and Balaräma are crawling!\" Upon hearing this, Kåñëa and Balaräma could understand that these were not Their mothers They were following, and They would return to Their actual mothers. Thus the crawling of Kåñëa and Balaräma was enjoyed by the people of the neighborhood, as well as by mother Yaçodä and Rohiëé and the two children Themselves."
