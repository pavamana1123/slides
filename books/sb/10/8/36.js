    "translation": "Mother Yaçodä challenged Kåñëa, \"If You have not eaten earth, then open Your mouth wide.\" When challenged by His mother in this way, Kåñëa, the son of Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä, to exhibit pastimes like a human child, opened His mouth. Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, who is full of all opulences, did not disturb His mother's parental affection, His opulence was automatically displayed, for Kåñëa's opulence is never lost at any stage, but is manifest at the proper time.",

When a person is given varieties of food, there may be a hundred and one varieties, but if one likes ordinary çäka, spinach, he prefers to eat that. Similarly, although Kåñëa was full of opulences, now, by the order of mother Yaçodä, He opened wide His mouth like a human child and did not neglect the transcendental humor of maternal affection."
