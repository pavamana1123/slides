Since Kaàsa was already searching for Kåñëa, if the purificatory process were undertaken by Garga Muni, Kaàsa might be informed, and that would create a catastrophe. It may be argued that although Garga Muni was the priest of the Yadu dynasty, Nanda Mahäräja also belonged to that dynasty. Nanda Mahäräja, however, was not acting as a kñatriya. Therefore Garga Muni said, \"If I act as your priest, this will confirm that Kåñëa is the son of Devaké.\""
