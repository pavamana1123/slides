    "translation": "Thereafter, O Mahäräja Parékñit, best of the Bhäratas, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead became the son of Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä, they maintained continuous, unswerving devotional love in parental affection. And in their association, all the other inhabitants of Våndävana, the gopas and gopés, developed the culture of kåñëa-bhakti.",

            "content": "Although when the Supreme Personality of Godhead stole the butter, curd and milk of the neighboring gopas and gopés this teasing superficially seemed troublesome, in fact it was an exchange of affection in the ecstasy of devotional service. The more the gopas and gopés exchanged feelings with the Lord, the more their devotional service increased. Sometimes we may superficially see that a devotee is in difficulty because of being engaged in devotional service, but the fact is different. When a devotee suffers for Kåñëa, that suffering is transcendental enjoyment. Unless one becomes a devotee, this cannot be understood. When Kåñëa exhibited His childhood pastimes, not only did Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä increase their devotional affection, but those in their association also increased in devotional service. In other words, persons who follow the activities of Våndävana will also develop devotional service in the highest perfection."
