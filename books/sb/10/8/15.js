As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38), the Lord is one, but He has many forms and many names. It was not that because Garga Muni gave the child the name Kåñëa, that was His only name. He has other names, such as Bhaktavatsala, Giridhäré, Govinda and Gopäla. If we analyze the nirukti, or semantic derivation, of the word \"Kåñëa,\" we find that na signifies that He stops the repetition of birth and death, and kåñ means sattärtha, or \"existence.\" (Kåñëa is the whole of existence.) Also, kåñ means \"attraction,\" and na means änanda, or \"bliss.\" Kåñëa is known as Mukunda because He wants to give everyone spiritual, eternal, blissful life. Unfortunately, because of the living entity's little independence, the living entity wants to \"deprogram\" the program of Kåñëa. This is the material disease. Nonetheless, because Kåñëa wants to give transcendental bliss to the living entities, He appears in various forms. Therefore He is called Kåñëa. Because Garga Muni was an astrologer, he knew what others did not know. Yet Kåñëa has so many names that even Garga Muni did not know them all. It is to be concluded that Kåñëa, according to His transcendental activities, has many names and many forms."
