    "translation": "\"When Kåñëa is caught in His naughty activities, the master of the house will say to Him, 'Oh, You are a thief,' and artificially express anger at Kåñëa. Kåñëa will then reply, 'I am not a thief. You are a thief.' Sometimes, being angry, Kåñëa passes urine and stool in a neat, clean place in our houses. But now, our dear friend Yaçodä, this expert thief is sitting before you like a very good boy.\" Sometimes all the gopés would look at Kåñëa sitting there, His eyes fearful so that His mother would not chastise Him, and when they saw Kåñëa's beautiful face, instead of chastising Him they would simply look upon His face and enjoy transcendental bliss. Mother Yaçodä would mildly smile at all this fun, and she would not want to chastise her blessed transcendental child.",

            "content": "Kåñëa's business in the neighborhood was not only to steal but sometimes to pass stool and urine in a neat, clean house. When caught by the master of the house, Kåñëa would chastise him, saying, \"You are a thief.\" Aside from being a thief in His childhood affairs, Kåñëa acted as an expert thief when He was young by attracting young girls and enjoying them in the räsa dance. This is Kåñëa's business. He is also violent, as the killer of many demons. Although mundane people like nonviolence and other such brilliant qualities, God, the Absolute Truth, being always the same, is good in any activities, even so-called immoral activities like stealing, killing and violence. Kåñëa is always pure, and He is always the Supreme Absolute Truth. Kåñëa may do anything supposedly abominable in material life, yet still He is attractive. Therefore His name is Kåñëa, meaning \"all-attractive.\" This is the platform on which transcendental loving affairs and service are exchanged. Because of the features of Kåñëa's face, the mothers were so attracted that they could not chastise Him. Instead of chastising Him, they smiled and enjoyed hearing of Kåñëa's activities. Thus the gopés remained satisfied, and Kåñëa enjoyed their happiness. Therefore another name of Kåñëa is Gopé-jana-vallabha because He invented such activities to please the gopés."
