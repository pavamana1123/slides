Unless she took care of her son Kåñëa, she thought, how could He be protected? She could not think otherwise, and thus she forgot all her philosophical speculations. This forgetfulness is described by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura as being inspired by the influence of yogamäyä (mohana-sädharmyän mäyäm). Materialistic persons are captivated by mahämäyä, whereas devotees, by the arrangement of the spiritual energy, are captivated by yogamäyä."
