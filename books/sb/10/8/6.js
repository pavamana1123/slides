The brähmaëas are required for the guidance of the whole society. If there is no such institution as varëäçrama-dharma and if human society has no such guide as the brähmaëa, human society will be hellish. In Kali-yuga, especially at the present moment, there is no such thing as a real brähmaëa, and therefore society is in a chaotic condition. Formerly there were qualified brähmaëas, but at present, although there are certainly persons who think themselves brähmaëas, they actually have no ability to guide society. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore very much eager to reintroduce the varëäçrama system into human society so that those who are bewildered or less intelligent will be able to take guidance from qualified brähmaëas."

            "content": "Brähmaëa means Vaiñëava. After one becomes a brähmaëa, the next stage of development in human society is to become a Vaiñëava. People in general must be guided to the destination or goal of life, and therefore they must understand Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The whole system of Vedic knowledge is based on this principle, but people have lost the clue (na te viduù svärtha-gatià hi viñëum ). It doesn't matter whether one is born a brähmaëa or not. No one is born a brähmaëa; everyone is born a çüdra. But by the guidance of a brähmaëa and by saàskära, one can become dvija, twice-born, and then gradually become a brähmaëa. Brähmaëism is not a system meant to create a monopoly for a particular class of men. Everyone should be educated so as to become a brähmaëa. At least there must be an opportunity to allow everyone to attain the destination of life. Regardless of whether one is born in a brähmaëa family, a kñatriya family or a çüdra family, one may be guided by a proper brähmaëa and be promoted to the highest platform of being a Vaiñëava. Thus the Kåñëa consciousness movement affords an opportunity to develop the right destiny for human society. Nanda Mahäräja took advantage of the opportunity of Garga Muni's presence by requesting him to perform the necessary reformatory activities for his sons to guide Them toward the destination of life."
