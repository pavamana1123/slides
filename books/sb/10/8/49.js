It is they who appear as Nanda Mahäräja and his wife, Yaçodä. In other words, it is not possible for a sädhana-siddha living being to become the father or mother of Kåñëa, for Kåñëa's father and mother are already designated. But by following the principles exhibited by Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä and their associates, the inhabitants of Våndävana, ordinary living beings may attain such affection as exhibited by Nanda and Yaçodä."

The Kåñëa consciousness movement, therefore, has been started so that by practicing Kåñëa consciousness one can avoid the risky life of this material existence. There is no question of accepting or not accepting Kåñëa consciousness. It is not optional; it is compulsory. If we do not take to Kåñëa consciousness, our life is very risky. Everything is explained in Bhagavad-gétä. Therefore, to learn how to become free from the miserable condition of material existence, Bhagavad-gétä As It Is is the preliminary study. Then, if one understands Bhagavad-gétä, one can proceed to Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and if one advances further, one may study Caitanya-caritämåta. We are therefore presenting these invaluable books to the whole world so that people may study them and be happy, being delivered from miserable conditional life."
