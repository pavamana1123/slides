    "translation": "\"When the milk and curd are kept high on a swing hanging from the ceiling and Kåñëa and Balaräma cannot reach it, They arrange to reach it by piling up various planks and turning upside down the mortar for grinding spices. Being quite aware of the contents of a pot, They pick holes in it. While the elderly gopés go about their household affairs, Kåñëa and Balaräma sometimes go into a dark room, brightening the place with the valuable jewels and ornaments on Their bodies and taking advantage of this light by stealing.\"",

But Kåñëa and Balaräma would pile up planks so that They could reach the pots and would then pick holes in the pots with Their hands so that the contents would leak out and They could drink it. This was another means for stealing butter and milk. When the butter and milk were kept in a dark room, Kåñëa and Balaräma would go there and make the place bright with the valuable jewels on Their bodies. On the whole, Kåñëa and Balaräma engaged in stealing butter and milk from the neighborhood houses in many ways."
