Nonetheless, He descends to this material world to protect the devotees and vanquish miscreants (pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm ). Similarly, Caitanya Mahäprabhu has advised this para-upakära, and He has especially advised the inhabitants of India:"

Thus he said, \"Please tell me what is my duty.\" This should be the attitude of everyone, especially the householder. The varëäçrama society is organized into eight divisions: brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya, çüdra, brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. Nanda Mahäräja represented himself as gåhiëäm, a householder. A brahmacäré factually has no needs, but gåhé, householders, are engaged in sense gratification. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , bhogaiçvarya-prasaktänäà tayäpahåta-cetasäm. Everyone has come to this material world for sense gratification, and the position of those who are too attached to sense gratification and who therefore accept the gåhastha-äçrama is very precarious. Since everyone in this material world is searching for sense gratification, gåhasthas are required to be trained as mahat, great mahätmäs. Therefore Nanda Mahäräja specifically used the word mahad-vicalanam. Garga Muni had no interest to serve by going to Nanda Mahäräja, but Nanda Mahäräja, as a gåhastha, was always perfectly ready to receive instructions from a mahätmä to gain the real benefit in life. Thus he was ready to execute Garga Muni's order."
