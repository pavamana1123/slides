Both families had the same original forefather, the only difference being that Nanda Mahäräja was born of a vaiçya wife whereas Vasudeva was born of a kñatriya wife. Later, Nanda Mahäräja married a vaiçya wife, and Vasudeva married a kñatriya wife. So although the families of Nanda Mahäräja and Vasudeva both came from the same father, they were divided as kñatriya and vaiçya. Now Baladeva united them, and therefore He was known as Saìkarñaëa."
