            "content": "One day, Vasudeva sent for Garga Muni, the family priest of the yadu-vaàça, and thus Garga Muni went to the house of Nanda Mahäräja, who received him very well and requested him to give names to Kåñëa and Balaräma. Garga Muni, of course, reminded Nanda Mahäräja that Kaàsa was looking for the son of Devaké and said that if he performed the ceremony very gorgeously, the ceremony would come to the notice of Kaàsa, who would then suspect that Kåñëa was the son of Devaké. Nanda Mahäräja therefore requested Garga Muni to perform this ceremony without anyone's knowledge, and Garga Muni did so. Because Balaräma, the son of Rohiëé, increases the transcendental bliss of others, His name is Räma, and because of His extraordinary strength, He is called Baladeva. He attracts the Yadus to follow His instructions, and therefore His name is Saìkarñaëa. Kåñëa, the son of Yaçodä, previously appeared in many other colors, such as white, red and yellow, and He had now assumed the color black. Because He was sometimes the son of Vasudeva, His name is Väsudeva. According to His various activities and qualities, He has many other names. After thus informing Nanda Mahäräja and completing the name-giving ceremony, Garga Muni advised Nanda Mahäräja to protect his son very carefully and then departed."

            "content": "Çukadeva Gosvämé next described how the two children crawled, walked on Their small legs, played with the cows and calves, stole butter and other milk products and broke the butter pots. In this way, he described many naughty activities of Kåñëa and Balaräma. The most wonderful of these occurred when Kåñëa's playmates complained to mother Yaçodä that Kåñëa was eating earth. Mother Yaçodä wanted to open Kåñëa's mouth to see the evidence so that she could chastise Him. Sometimes she assumed the position of a chastising mother, and at the next moment she was overwhelmed with maternal love. After describing all this to Mahäräja Parékñit, Çukadeva Gosvämé, at Mahäräja Parékñit's request, praised the fortune of mother Yaçodä and Nanda. Nanda and Yaçodä were formerly Droëa and Dharä, and by the order of Brahmä they came to this earth and had the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their son."
