[In another Dväpara-yuga, He appeared (as Lord Rämacandra) in the color of çuka, a parrot.] All such incarnations have now assembled in Kåñëa.",

In other words, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and may therefore do whatever He desires. In Vedic literature the different colors assumed by the Personality of Godhead in different millenniums are stated, and therefore when Garga Muni said, \"Your son has assumed these colors,\" he indirectly said, \"He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\" Because of Kaàsa's atrocities, Garga Muni tried to avoid disclosing this fact, but he indirectly informed Nanda Mahäräja that Kåñëa, his son, was the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

In every millennium, Kåñëa appears in a different form, either as white, red or yellow, but this time He personally appeared in His original, blackish form and, as predicted by Garga Muni, exhibited the power of Näräyaëa. Because in this form the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibits Himself fully, His name is Çré Kåñëa, the all-attractive."

When Kåñëa incarnates, all the features of other incarnations are already present within Him. Other incarnations are partial representations of Kåñëa, who is the full-fledged incarnation of the Supreme Being. It is to be understood that the Supreme Being, whether appearing as çukla, rakta or péta (white, red or yellow), is the same person. When He appears in different incarnations, He appears in different colors, just like the sunshine, which contains seven colors. Sometimes the colors of sunshine are represented separately; otherwise the sunshine is observed mainly as bright light. The different avatäras, such as the manvantara-avatäras, lélä-avatäras and daça-avatäras, are all included in the kåñëa-avatära. When Kåñëa appears, all the avatäras appear with Him. As described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

            "content": "The Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam describes the incarnations for each yuga in chronological order. The Bhägavatam says, kåte çuklaç catur-bähuù, tretäyäà rakta-varëo'sau, dväpare bhagavän çyämaù and kåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëam . We actually see that in Kali-yuga, Bhagavän has appeared in péta-varëa, or a yellow color, as Gaurasundara, although the Bhägavatam speaks of kåñëa-varëam. To adjust all these statements, one should understand that although in some yugas some of the colors are prominent, in every yuga, whenever Kåñëa appears, all the colors are present. Kåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëam: although Caitanya Mahäprabhu appears without kåñëa, or a blackish color, He is understood to be Kåñëa Himself. Idänéà kåñëatäà gataù. The same original Kåñëa who appears in different varëas has now appeared. The word äsan indicates that He is always present. Whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in His full feature, He is understood to be kåñëa-varëam, although He appears in different colors. Prahläda Mahäräja states that Caitanya Mahäprabhu is channa; that is, although He is Kåñëa, He is covered by a yellow color. Thus the Gauòéya Vaiñëavas accept the conclusion that although Caitanya Mahäprabhu appeared in péta color, He is Kåñëa."
