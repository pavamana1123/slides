            "content": "When Kåñëa descends anywhere, He is accompanied by His own associates. These associates are not ordinary living beings. Kåñëa's pastimes are eternal, and when He descends, He comes with His associates. Therefore Nanda and mother Yaçodä are the eternal father and mother of Kåñëa. This means that whenever Kåñëa descends, Nanda and Yaçodä, as well as Vasudeva and Devaké, also descend as the Lord's father and mother. Their personalities are expansions of Kåñëa's personal body; they are not ordinary living beings. Mahäräja Parékñit knew this, but he was curious to know from Çukadeva Gosvämé whether it is possible for an ordinary human being to come to this stage by sädhana-siddhi. There are two kinds of perfection—nitya-siddhi and sädhana-siddhi. A nitya-siddha is one who is eternally Kåñëa's associate, an expansion of Kåñëa's personal body, whereas a sädhana-siddha is an ordinary human being who, by executing pious activities and following regulative principles of devotional service, also comes to that stage. Thus the purpose of Mahäräja Parékñit's inquiry was to determine whether an ordinary human being can attain the position of mother Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja. Çukadeva Gosvämé answered this question as follows."
