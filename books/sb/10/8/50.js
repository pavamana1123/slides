    "translation": "When Brahmä said, \"Yes, let it be so,\" the most fortune Droëa, who was equal to Bhagavän, appeared in Vrajapura, Våndävana, as the most famous Nanda Mahäräja, and his wife, Dharä, appeared as mother Yaçodä.",

In contrast to Sutapä and Påçnigarbha, they did not undergo severe penances and austerities to become the father and mother of Kåñëa. This is the difference between nitya-siddha and sädhana-siddha."
