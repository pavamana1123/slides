    "translation": "Although Kåñëa was so pleased with Vasudeva and Devaké that He descended as their son, they could not enjoy Kåñëa's magnanimous childhood pastimes, which are so great that simply chanting about them vanquishes the contamination of the material world. Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä, however, enjoyed these pastimes fully, and therefore their position is always better than that of Vasudeva and Devaké.",

Therefore Parékñit Mahäräja was astonished. How had mother Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja become so fortunate that they enjoyed the complete childhood pastimes of Kåñëa, which are still glorified by saintly persons? What had they done in the past by which they were elevated to such an exalted position?"
