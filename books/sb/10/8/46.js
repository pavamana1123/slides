Without sukåti, or pious activities, no one can come to the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is approached by four kinds of pious men (ärto jijïäsur arthärthé jïäné ca), but here we see that Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä surpassed all of them. Therefore Parékñit Mahäräja naturally inquired, \"What kind of pious activities did they perform in their past lives by which they achieved such a stage of perfection?\" Of course, Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä are accepted as the father and mother of Kåñëa, yet mother Yaçodä was more fortunate than Nanda Mahäräja, Kåñëa's father, because Nanda Mahäräja was sometimes separated from Kåñëa whereas Yaçodä, Kåñëa's mother, was not separated from Kåñëa at any moment. From Kåñëa's babyhood to His childhood and from His childhood to His youth, mother Yaçodä was always in association with Kåñëa. Even when Kåñëa was grown up, He would go to Våndävana and sit on the lap of mother Yaçodä. Therefore there is no comparison to the fortune of mother Yaçodä, and Parékñit Mahäräja naturally inquired, yaçodä ca mahä-bhägä."
