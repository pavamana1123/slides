His pastimes in Gokula, His dhäma, are always favorable to the brähmaëas and the cows. His first business is to give all comfort to the cows and the brähmaëas. In fact, comfort for the brähmaëas is secondary, and comfort for the cows is His first concern. Because of His presence, all people would overcome all difficulties and always be situated in transcendental bliss."
