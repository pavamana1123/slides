Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu explained to Sanätana Gosvämé that there are three purposes in the Vedas. One is to understand our relationship with Kåñëa (sambandha), another is to act according to that relationship (abhidheya), and the third is to reach the ultimate goal (prayojana). The word prayojana means \"necessities,\" and the ultimate necessity is explained by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. premä pum-artho mahän: the greatest necessity for a human being is the achievement of love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here we see that mother Yaçodä is on the highest stage of necessity, for she is completely absorbed in love for Kåñëa."

When one reaches the complete, perfect stage of upäsanä-käëòa, one comes to worship Näräyaëa, or Lord Viñëu. When Pärvaté asked Lord Mahädeva, Lord Çiva, what is the best method of upäsanä, or worship, Lord Çiva answered, ärädhanänäà sarveñäà viñëor ärädhanaà param. Viñëüpäsanä, or viñëv-ärädhana, worship of Lord Viñëu, is the highest stage of perfection, as realized by Devaké. But here mother Yaçodä performs no upäsanä, for she has developed transcendental ecstatic love for Kåñëa. Therefore her position is better than that of Devaké. In order to show this, Çréla Vyäsadeva enunciates this verse, trayyä copaniñadbhiù etc."
