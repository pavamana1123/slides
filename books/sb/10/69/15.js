    "translation": "The Lord bathed Närada's feet and then put the water on His own head. Although Lord Kåñëa is the supreme spiritual authority of the universe and the master of His devotees, it was proper for Him to behave in this way, for His name is Brahmaëya-deva, \"the Lord who favors the båähmaëas.\" Thus Çré Kåñëa honored the sage Närada by bathing his feet, even though the water that bathes the Lord's own feet becomes the Ganges, the ultimate holy shrine.",

Rather, as Çréla Prabhupäda explains, \"Lord Kåñëa in Dvärakä enjoyed the pastimes of a perfect human being. When, therefore, He washed the feet of the sage Närada and took the water on His head, Närada did not object, knowing well that the Lord did so to teach everyone how to respect saintly persons.\""
