Lord Kåñëa worshiped Närada by standing up, offering him a seat, and so on, and then, as if He did not know, asked him, \"When did you arrive? What can needy persons like Us do for those who are full in themselves? In any case, My dear brähmaëa, please make My life auspicious.\" Thus addressed, Närada was astonished. He simply stood up silently and went to another palace.",
