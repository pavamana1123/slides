    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: Hearing that Lord Kåñëa had killed Narakäsura and had alone married many brides, Närada Muni desired to see the Lord in this situation. He thought, \"It is quite amazing that in a single body Lord Kåñëa simultaneously married sixteen thousand women, each in a separate palace.\" Thus the sage of the demigods eagerly went to Dvärakä.The city was filled with the sounds of birds and bees flying about the parks and pleasure gardens, while its lakes, crowded with blooming indévara, ambhoja, kahlära, kumuda and utpala lotuses, resounded with the calls of swans and cranes. Dvärakä boasted nine hundred thousand royal palaces, all constructed with crystal and silver and splendorously decorated with huge emeralds. Inside these palaces, the furnishings were bedecked with gold and jewels. Traffic moved along a well-laid-out system of boulevards, roads, intersections and marketplaces, and many assembly houses and temples of demigods graced the charming city. The roads, courtyards, commercial streets and residential patios were all sprinkled with water and shaded from the sun's heat by banners waving from flagpoles.",

            "content": "In Kåñëa, Çréla Prabhupäda beautifully describes the city of Dvärakä as follows: \"Being inquisitive as to how Kåñëa was managing His household affairs with so many wives, Närada desired to see these pastimes and so set out to visit Kåñëa's different homes. When Närada arrived in Dvärakä, he saw that the gardens and parks were full of various flowers of different colors and orchards that were overloaded with a variety of fruits. Beautiful birds were chirping, and peacocks were delightfully crowing. There were tanks and ponds full of blue and red lotus flowers, and some of these sites were filled with varieties of lilies. The lakes were full of nice swans and cranes, whose voices resounded everywhere. In the city there were as many as 900,000 great palaces built of first-class marble, with gates and doors made of silver. The posts of the houses and palaces were bedecked with jewels such as touchstone, sapphires and emeralds, and the floors gave off a beautiful luster. The highways, lanes, streets, crossings and marketplaces were all beautifully decorated. The whole city was full of residential homes, assembly houses and temples, all of different architectural beauty. All of this made Dvärakä a glowing city. The big avenues, crossings, lanes and streets, and also the thresholds of every residential house, were very clean. On both sides of every path there were bushes, and at regular intervals there were large trees that shaded the avenues so that the sunshine would not bother the passersby.\""
