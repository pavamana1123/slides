This term may indicate that the Lord performed activities in Dvärakä that were unusual even for His plenary expansions, to say nothing of others. Or the term can be understood to indicate that the Lord performed these activities for the sake of His pure, exclusive devotees. In any case, one who recites or hears accounts of these pastimes will certainly be engaged in Kåñëa consciousness and, as Çréla Prabhupäda writes, \"certainly find it very easy to traverse the path of liberation and taste the nectar of the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa.\" Çréla Prabhupäda further points out that the word anumodate here indicates that one who \"supports a preacher of the Kåñëa consciousness movement\" will also receive the benefits mentioned here."
