Thus he went to Dvärakä. Närada entered one of the sixteen thousand palaces and saw Goddess Rukmiëé personally rendering menial service to Çré Kåñëa, despite her being in the company of thousands of maidservants. As soon as Lord Kåñëa noticed Närada, He got up from His bed, offered obeisances to the sage and seated him on His own seat. Then the Lord bathed Närada's feet and sprinkled the water on His own head. Such was the exemplary behavior of the Lord."

            "content": "After conversing with the Lord for a short while, Närada went to another of His palaces, where the sage saw Çré Kåñëa playing at dice with His queen and Uddhava. Going from there to another palace, he found Lord Kåñëa coddling His infant children. In another palace he saw Him preparing to take a bath; in another, performing fire sacrifices, in another, feeding brähmaëas; and in another, eating the remnants left by brähmaëas. In one palace the Lord was performing noontime rituals; in another, quietly chanting the Gäyatré mantra; in another, sleeping on His bed; in another, consulting with His ministers; and in yet another, playing in the water with His female companions. Somewhere the Lord was giving charity to brähmaëas, in another place He was joking and laughing with His consort, in yet another place He was meditating on the Supersoul, somewhere He was serving His spiritual masters, in another place He was arranging for the marriages of His sons and daughters, somewhere else He was going out to hunt animals, and elsewhere He was moving about in disguise to find out what the citizens were thinking."

Thus I am most fortunate, and I simply desire to travel all over the three worlds chanting the glories of Your pastimes, which purify all the worlds.\""

He then honored the sage properly, according to religious principles, and Närada departed, continuously meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
