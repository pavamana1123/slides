    "translation": "After fully worshiping the great sage of the demigods according to Vedic injunctions, Lord Kåñëa, who is Himself the original sage—Näräyaëa, the friend of Nara—conversed with Närada, and the Lord's measured speech was as sweet as nectar. Finally the Lord asked Närada, \"What may We do for you, Our lord and master?\"",

In other words, Lord Kåñëa is åñiù puräëaù, the original and supreme spiritual master. Nevertheless, following the Vedic injunctions (vidhinoditena) that a kñatriya should worship the brähmaëas, Lord Kåñëa happily worshiped His pure devotee Närada Muni."
