As Çréla Prabhupäda writes in Kåñëa, \"The Supreme Personality of Godhead was engaged in His so-called household affairs in order to teach people how one can sanctify one's household life although he may be attached to the imprisonment of material existence. Actually, one is obliged to continue the term of material existence because of household life. But the Lord, being very kind upon householders, demonstrated the path of sanctifying ordinary household life. Because Kåñëa is the center of all activities, a Kåñëa conscious householder's life is transcendental to Vedic injunctions and is automatically sanctified.\""

            "content": "As stated in Text 2 of this chapter, all the Lord's activities in the many palaces were performed by the Lord's single spiritual form (ekena vapuñä), which manifested in many places at once. This vision was revealed to Närada because of his desire to see it and the Lord's desire to show it to him. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that the other residents of Dvärakä could see Kåñëa only in the particular part of the city they themselves occupied, and not anywhere else, even if they would sometimes go to another precinct on some business. Thus the Lord gave a special view of His pastimes to His beloved devotee Närada Muni."
