It implies that the worshipers mentioned before have not completely purified their intelligence of material contamination and thus worship the Lord indirectly. Those who are purified, however, directly worship the Lord, either as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, or as one of His various plenary forms, such as Väsudeva, Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna or Aniruddha, as indicated here."
