At the gate of the wrestling arena They encountered an elephant named Kuvalayäpéòa, who attacked Kåñëa at the urging of his keeper. The mighty elephant grabbed at Kåñëa with his trunk, but the Lord struck back and then disappeared from the beast's sight among his legs. Enraged at not being able to see Kåñëa, Kuvalayäpéòa sought Him out with his sense of smell and seized Him. But the Lord pulled loose. In this way Kåñëa teased and tormented Kuvalayäpéòa, finally yanking out one of his tusks and beating him and his keepers to death."

The people declared that Kåñëa and Balaräma must be two expansions of the Supreme Lord Näräyaëa who had descended into the house of Vasudeva."
