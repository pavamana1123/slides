    "translation": "The people seemed to be drinking Kåñëa and Balaräma with their eyes, licking Them with their tongues, smelling Them with their nostrils and embracing Them with their arms.

And now that the people were seeing Kåñëa and Balaräma enter the arena, their greatest expectations were confirmed. Kåñëa is the embodiment of all beauty, fame and opulence, and therefore those assembled in the wrestling arena became fully satisfied by glorifying what they had heard of Him and were now seeing."
