Actually, Lord Kåñëa is everyone's friend and well-wisher, but because we rebel against Him, He chastises us, and thus we may perceive Him as threatening. Kåñëa, or God, is actually merciful, and when He punishes us, that is also His mercy."

Thus altogether there are twelve rasas, and the supreme object of them all is Çré Kåñëa Himself. In other words, our love and affection are actually meant for Çré Kåñëa. Unfortunately, out of ignorance we stubbornly try to squeeze happiness and love out of material relationships, which are not directly connected to Kåñëa, and thus life becomes a constant frustration. The solution is simple: surrender to Kåñëa, love Kåñëa, love Kåñëa's devotees and be happy forever."
