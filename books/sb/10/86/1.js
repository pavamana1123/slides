In the opinion of Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, King Parékñit's question here follows from the previous narration because Arjuna's winning the hand of Subhadrä was just as difficult a feat as Lord Kåñëa's retrieving the sons of Devaké from the realm of the dead, since Lord Balaräma Himself opposed Subhadrä's marriage to Arjuna."
