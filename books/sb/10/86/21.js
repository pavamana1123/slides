    "translation": "Simply by glancing at those who came to see Him, Lord Kåñëa, the spiritual master of the three worlds, delivered them from the blindness of materialism. As He thus endowed them with fearlessness and divine vision, He heard demigods and men singing His glories, which purify the entire universe and destroy all misfortune. Gradually, He reached Videha.",

            "content": "Çréla Jéva Gosvämé raises the logical question of how the ordinary people along the path could even see the Lord, since not only were their eyes covered by ignorance, but the Lord's chariot was traveling faster than the wind. Supplying the answer, Çréla Jéva indicates that Lord Kåñëa's special glance of mercy empowered every one of them with the devotional purity required for entering into His association. Otherwise, He would have remained outside the scope of their power to see, as He Himself states in His instructions to Uddhava: bhaktyäham ekayä grähyaù. \"I can be perceived only by devotion.\"  By the grammatical rule of compound formation known as eka-çeña, the term sta-vékñaëa-vinañöa-tamisra-dågbhyaù, although in its primary sense inflected as a masculine noun, may be understood in this context as referring to both men and women."
