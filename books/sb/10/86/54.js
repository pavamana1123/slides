The Supreme Personality of Godhead can be known only by means of the Vedas, and thus He relies on the brähmaëa sages, who are the Vedas personified, to reveal Him in this world. Even though Lord Kåñëa embodies all the demigods and viñëu-tattva expansions of Näräyaëa, He considers Himself obliged to the brähmaëas."
