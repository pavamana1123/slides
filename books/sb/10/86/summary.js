Wanting to kidnap Subhadrä and marry her himself, Arjuna disguised himself as a renunciant and went to Dvärakä. So effective was the disguise that neither Balaräma nor any other resident of Dvärakä recognized him; rather, they all showed him the respect due a Vaiñëava mendicant. In this way the four months of the rainy season passed. One day Arjuna received an invitation to dine at Lord Balaräma's home. There he caught sight of Subhadrä and was immediately overwhelmed with desire for her. Subhadrä also desired to have Arjuna as her husband, and thus she glanced back at him shyly. A few days later, Subhadrä left the palace to participate in a chariot festival. Taking this opportunity, Arjuna abducted Subhadrä and defeated the Yädavas who tried to stop him. Lord Balaräma was at first greatly angered to hear of this, but when Lord Çré Kåñëa and other family members pacified Him, He became joyful and sent the bride and groom off with elaborate wedding gifts.\""

            "content": "There was a brähmaëa devotee of Çré Kåñëa's named Çrutadeva, who lived in the city of Mithila. By the will of Providence, he could earn only barely enough to keep himself and his family alive. Still, he was always satisfied and spent all his time executing his religious duties. King Bahuläçva was another great devotee of the Lord residing in Mithilä. A member of the dynasty in which King Janaka had appeared, Bahuläçva ruled over the whole province of Videha, yet he remained as detached from material wealth as Çrutadeva. Pleased with the devotional attitude of both these great souls, Lord Kåñëa went on His chariot to Mithilä to visit them, taking along Närada and several other learned sages. The people of Mithila greeted the Lord and His saintly entourage with great delight. Bearing various gifts for Kåñëa, they bowed down and offered obeisances to both Him and the sages."

To satisfy both of them, the Lord expanded Himself and went to each of their homes simultaneously. They each worshiped Him suitably, offered prayers, washed His feet and then sprinkled themselves and all their family members with the wash water. Lord Kåñëa then praised the sages who were with Him and glorified brähmaëas in general. He also imparted instructions to His hosts concerning devotional service. Understanding these instructions, both Çrutadeva and Bahuläçva honored the sages and Lord Çré Kåñëa with single-minded devotion. Lord Kåñëa then returned to Dvärakä."
