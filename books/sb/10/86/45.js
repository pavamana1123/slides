In somewhat the same way, the Lord manifests the cosmos. Of course, the creation is not illusory for the Lord, but it is for those souls who are put under the control of His Mäyä potency. As her service to the Lord, Mäyä deludes the conditioned souls into accepting as real her temporary, insubstantial manifestations."
