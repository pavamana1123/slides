    "translation": "Let me offer my obeisances unto You. You are realized as the Supreme Soul by those who know the Absolute Truth, whereas in Your form of time You impose death upon the forgetful souls. You appear both in Your causeless spiritual form and in the created form of this universe, thus simultaneously uncovering the eyes of Your devotees and obstructing the vision of the nondevotees.",

For the nondevotees, on the other hand, the Lord \"appears\" as material nature, His universal form, and in this way He covers their vision so that His spiritual, personal form remains invisible to them."

The devotees of the Lord who are in the reciprocal mood of neutral admiration (çänta-rasa) meditate on the Supreme as possessing a divine, personal form (ätmä or çré-vigraha) transcending all aspects of material illusion. The impersonal philosophers (jïänés) conceive of Him as formless (anätmä). And the envious demons see Him in the form of death."
