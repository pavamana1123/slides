Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda concludes, \"The instruction we receive from this incident is that King Bahuläçva and Çrutadeva the brähmaëa were accepted by the Lord on the same level because both were pure devotees. This is the real qualification for being recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because it has become the fashion of this age to become falsely proud of having taken birth in the family of a kñatriya or a brähmaëa, we see persons without any qualification claiming to be brähmaëa or kñatriya or vaiçya. But as it is stated in the scriptures, kalau çüdra-sambhava: 'In this age of Kali, everyone is born a çüdra.' This is because there is no performance of the purificatory process known as saàskäras, which begin from the time of the mother's pregnancy and continue up to the point of the individual's death. No one can be classified as a member of a particular caste, especially of a higher caste-brähmaëa, kñatriya or vaiçya—simply by birthright. If one is not purified by the process of the seed-giving ceremony, or Garbhädhäna-saàskära, he is immediately classified among the çüdras, because only the çüdras do not undergo this purificatory process. Sex life without the purificatory process of Kåñëa consciousness is merely the seed-giving process of the çüdras or the animals. But Kåñëa consciousness is the highest perfection, by which everyone can come to the platform of a Vaiñëava. This includes having all the qualifications of a brähmaëa. The Vaiñëavas are trained to become freed from the four kinds of sinful activities—illicit sex, indulgence in intoxicants, gambling and eating animal foodstuffs. No one can be on the brahminical platform without having these preliminary qualifications, and without becoming a qualified brähmaëa, one cannot become a pure devotee.\""
