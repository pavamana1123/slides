    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: While traveling far and wide visiting various holy places of pilgrimage, Arjuna came to Prabhäsa. There he heard that Lord Balaräma intended to give his maternal cousin Subhadrä to Duryodhana in marriage, and that no one else approved of this plan. Arjuna wanted to marry her himself, so he disguised himself as a renunciant, complete with triple staff, and went to Dvärakä.",

And in Dvärakä, most of the members of the royal family, especially Vasudeva, were unhappy about giving their favorite daughter to Duryodhana."
