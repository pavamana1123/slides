This opulence is described in the revealed scriptures as vaibhava-prakäça. Similarly, when Lord Kåñëa married sixteen thousand wives, He also expanded Himself into sixteen thousand forms, each one of them as powerful as He Himself. Similarly, in Våndävana, when Brahmä stole away Kåñëa's cows, calves and cowherd boys, Kåñëa expanded Himself into many new cows, calves and cowherd boys.\""
