This demigod Cupid is a partial manifestation of the prototype Cupid, Pradyumna, who is a plenary expansion of Väsudeva. The demigod Cupid, being unable to attain a new body on his own, entered within the body of Pradyumna. Otherwise Cupid would have had to remain in a perpetual state of disembodiment, a result of Rudra's having incinerated him with his anger.\""
