Çambara, having also come to Çiva for a benediction, was recognized by the lord first, who told him, \"You should now ask for your benediction.\" Çambara, struck with lust at seeing Rati, replied that he wanted her as his benediction, and Çiva complied. Lord Çiva then consoled the sobbing Rati, telling her, \"Go with him, and in his very home you will attain what you desire.\" Thereupon, Rati bewildered Çambara with her deluding power and, taking the name Mäyävaté, remained in his house untouched."
