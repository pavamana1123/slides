    "translation": "It is not astonishing that the palace women, who should have felt maternal affection for Pradyumna, privately felt ecstatic attraction for Him as if He were their own Lord. After all, the son exactly resembled His father. Indeed, Pradyumna was a perfect reflection of the beauty of Lord Kåñëa, the shelter of the goddess of fortune, and appeared before their eyes as Cupid Himself. Since even those on the level of His mother felt conjugal attraction for Him, then what to speak of how other women felt when they saw Him?",

Çréla Prabhupäda comments as follows in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead: \"Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé has explained that in the beginning all the residents of the palace, who were all mothers and stepmothers of Pradyumna, mistook Him to be Kåñëa and were all bashful, infected by the desire for conjugal love. The explanation is that Pradyumna's personal appearance was exactly like Kåñëa's, and He was factually Cupid Himself. There was no cause of astonishment, therefore, when the mothers of Pradyumna and other women mistook Him in that way. It is clear from the statement that Pradyumna's bodily characteristics were so similar to Kåñëa's that He was mistaken to be Kåñëa even by His mother.\""
