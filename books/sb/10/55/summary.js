A demon named Çambara, thinking Pradyumna his enemy, kidnapped Him from the maternity room even before He was ten days old. Çambara threw Pradyumna into the ocean and returned to his kingdom. A powerful fish swallowed Pradyumna and was caught by fishermen in a net. They presented the huge fish to Çambara, and when his cooks cut it open they found a child within its belly. The cooks gave the infant to the maidservant Mäyävaté, who was astonished to see Him. Just then Närada Muni appeared and told her who the infant was. Mäyävaté was actually Kämadeva's wife, Ratidevé. While waiting for her husband to be reborn in a new body, she had taken employment as a cook in the household of Çambara. Now that she understood who the infant was, she began to feel intense affection for Him. After a very short time, Pradyumna grew to youthful maturity, entrancing all the women with His beauty."

            "content": "Once, Ratidevé approached Pradyumna and playfully moved her eyebrows in a conjugal mood. Addressing her as His mother, Pradyumna commented that she was putting aside her proper maternal mood and behaving like a passionate girlfriend. Rati then told Pradyumna who they both were. She advised Him to kill Çambara, and to help Him she instructed Him in the mystic mantras known as Mahä-mäyä. Pradyumna went to Çambara and, after angering him with various insults, challenged him to fight, upon which Çambara angrily took up his club and marched outside. The demon tried various magic spells against Pradyumna, but Pradyumna fended off all of them with the Mahä-mäyä mantras and then beheaded Çambara with His sword. At that moment Ratidevé appeared in the sky and took Pradyumna away to Dvärakä."

Out of shyness the ladies ran here and there to hide themselves. But after a little while they noticed small differences in Pradyumna's and Kåñëa's appearances, and once they understood that He was not Lord Kåñëa, they gathered around Him."

Noting that Pradyumna looked exactly like Kåñëa, she became eager to find out who He was. She remembered how one of her sons had been abducted from the maternity room. \"If He were still alive,\" she thought, \"He would be the same age as this Pradyumna standing before me.\" While Rukmiëé reflected in this way, Lord Kåñëa arrived in the company of Devaké and Vasudeva. Although the Lord understood the situation perfectly well, He remained silent. Then Närada Muni arrived and explained everything. Everyone was amazed to hear the account and embraced Pradyumna in great ecstasy."

He was, after all, the exact reflection of Çré Kåñëa, and therefore it was natural for them to see Him in this way."
