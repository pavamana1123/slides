Having vowed then that he would rid the earth of all the Yädavas, he began worshiping Lord Çiva each day by eating only a palmful of dust. After a year had passed, Çiva appeared before Çälva and asked him to choose a benediction. Çälva begged for a flying machine that could go anywhere and that would strike terror into the hearts of demigods, demons and humans alike. Lord Çiva granted this request and had Maya Dänava construct for Çälva a flying iron city named Saubha. Çälva took this vehicle to Dvärakä, where he and his huge army laid siege to the city. From his airplane Çälva bombarded Dvärakä with tree trunks, boulders and other missiles, and he produced a mighty whirlwind that obscured everything with dust."

            "content": "When Pradyumna, Sätyaki and the other Yadu heroes saw the plight of Dvärakä and her residents, they went out to do battle with Çälva's forces. Pradyumna, the best of warriors, destroyed with His divine weapons all of Çälva's illusory magic, and He also bewildered Çälva himself. Thus Çälva's airplane began wandering aimlessly on the earth, in the sky and on the tops of mountains. But then a follower of Çälva's named Dyumän struck Pradyumna on the chest with his club, whereupon Pradyumna's chariot driver, thinking his master seriously injured, carried Him from the battlefield. But Pradyumna quickly regained consciousness and sharply criticized His driver for doing this."
