Trivakrä welcomed Kåñëa with great respect, giving Him a raised seat and, together with her female companions, worshiping Him. She also offered Uddhava a seat, as befitted his position, but Uddhava simply touched the seat and sat on the floor."

Kåñëa invited Trivakrä to the bed and began to enjoy with her in various ways. By embracing Lord Kåñëa, Trivakrä freed herself of the torment of lust. She asked Kåñëa to remain with her for some time, and the considerate Lord promised to fulfill her request in due course. He then returned with Uddhava to His residence. Apart from offering sandal paste to Kåñëa, Trivakrä had never performed any pious acts, yet simply on the strength of the piety of this single act she attained the rare personal association of Çré Kåñëa."

Then he worshiped Räma and Kåñëa, washed Their feet and poured the water on his head. Akrüra also offered Them many prayers."

He told him that since he, Akrüra, was in fact Their paternal uncle, Kåñëa and Balaräma should be the recipients of his protection and mercy. Lord Kåñëa then praised Akrüra as a saint and purifier of the sinful, and He asked him to visit Hastinäpura to find out how the Päëòavas, deprived of their father, were faring. Finally, the Lord returned home, taking Balaräma and Uddhava with Him."
