    "translation": "You create, destroy and also maintain this universe with Your personal energies—the modes of passion, ignorance and goodness—yet You are never entangled by these modes or the activities they generate. Since You are the original source of all knowledge, what could ever cause You to be bound by illusion?",

Therefore the impersonalistic theory that we are all God but have forgotten and are now in illusion is refuted here in the pages of Çrémad-Bhägavatam."
