On the one hand, she is understood to be a liberated soul, directly associating with the Lord and participating in His pastimes. On the other hand, her conduct is clearly meant to teach a lesson about what not to do in relation with Lord Kåñëa. Since all of the Lord's pastimes are not only blissful but also didactic, there is no real contradiction in this pastime, since Trivakrä's purity and her bad example take place on two distinct levels. Arjuna is also considered a pure devotee, yet by initially disobeying Kåñëa's instruction to fight, he also showed an example of what not to do. However, such \"bad examples\" always have happy endings in the blissful association of the Absolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa."
