Throughout the Bhägavatam and other authorized Vedic literatures, we often find descriptions of the Lord's simultaneous supremacy over all other things and His identity with them. We cannot reasonably draw any other conclusion from Vedic literature than the one powerfully preached by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu: acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva. That is, the Absolute Truth is greater than and distinct from everything (since He is the omnipotent creator and controller of all), and simultaneously one with everything (since all that exists is the expansion of His own power)."

            "content": "Throughout these chapters of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, we also observe one of the unique, extraordinary features of this great work. Whether Kåñëa is sending His message to the gopés or accepting the prayers of Akrüra, there is constant philosophical discussion. Throughout the Bhägavatam, the steady combination of fascinating pastimes with persistent spiritual philosophy is an extraordinary feature. We are allowed to glimpse and even to relish the spiritual emotions of the Lord and His liberated associates, and yet we are constantly reminded of their ontological position lest we lapse into a cheap, anthropomorphic vision. Thus it is entirely in character with the work that Akrüra, in his ecstasy, glorifies the Lord with precise philosophical prayers."
