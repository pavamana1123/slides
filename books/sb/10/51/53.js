Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains this apparent inversion of sequence by quoting the Kävya-prakäça (10.153) as follows: kärya-käraëayoç ca paurväparya-viparyayo vijïeyätiçayoktiù syät sa. \"A statement in which the logical order of a cause and its effect is reversed should be understood as atiçayokti, emphasis by extreme assertion.\" Çréla Jéva Gosvämé cites the following commentary on this statement: käraëasya çéghra-kärétäà vaktuà käryasya pürvam uktau. \"To express the swift action of a cause, one may assert the result before the cause.\""
