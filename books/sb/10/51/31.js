            "content": "It is common in Vedic culture that a kñatriya will humbly introduce himself as kñatra-bandhu, a mere relative in a kñatriya family, or in other words a fallen kñatriya. In ancient Vedic culture, to claim a particular status on the basis of one's family relations was itself indicative of a fallen position. Kñatriyas and brähmaëas should be given status according to their merit, by their qualities of work and character. When the caste system in India became degraded, people proudly claimed to be relatives of kñatriyas or brähmaëas, though in the past such a claim, unaccompanied by tangible qualifications, indicated a fallen position."
