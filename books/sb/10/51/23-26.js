    "translation": "As he gazed at the Lord, King Mucukunda saw that He was dark blue like a cloud, had four arms, and wore a yellow silk garment. On His chest He bore the Çrévatsa mark and on His neck the brilliantly glowing Kaustubha gem. Adorned with a Vaijayanté garland, the Lord displayed His handsome, peaceful face, which attracts the eyes of all mankind with its shark-shaped earrings and affectionately smiling glance. The beauty of His youthful form was unexcelled, and He moved with the nobility of an angry lion. The highly intelligent King was overwhelmed by the Lord's effulgence, which showed Him to be invincible. Expressing his uncertainty, Mucukunda hesitantly questioned Lord Kåñëa as follows.",

            "content": "It is significant that Text 24 states, catur-bhujaà rocamänam: \"The Lord was seen in the beauty of His four-armed form.\" Throughout this great work, we find Lord Kåñëa manifesting His various transcendental forms, most prominently the two-armed form of Kåñëa and the four-armed form of Näräyaëa or Viñëu. Thus there is no doubt that Kåñëa and Viñëu are nondifferent, or that Kåñëa is the original form of the Lord. These things are sometimes misunderstood, but the great äcäryas, experts in spiritual science, have clarified the matter for us. God in His original form is not merely the creator, maintainer and destroyer, or the punisher of conditioned souls, but rather the infinitely beautiful Godhead, enjoying in His own right, in His own abode. This is the form of Kåñëa, the same Kåñëa who expands Himself into Viñëu forms for the maintenance of our bumbling world."
