All of this is taking place within the context of kåñëa-lélä, the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa. It is well known to Vaiñëavas that the four-handed forms of Viñëu, or Näräyaëa, are expansions of Çré Kåñëa. Thus within the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa there may also appear viñëu-lélä, the activities of Viñëu. Such are the qualities and activities of the Supreme Godhead. Deeds that for us would be extraordinary and even impossible are commonplace, effortless pastimes for the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

According to Äcärya Viçvanätha, Garga Muni further informed Mucukunda that he would personally see the Lord. Now it was all happening."
