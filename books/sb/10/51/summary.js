Kälayavana saw that Kåñëa's brilliantly effulgent body matched Närada's description of the Lord, and thus the Yavana knew He was the Personality of Godhead. Seeing that the Lord carried no weapons, Kälayavana put his own weapons aside and ran toward Him from behind, wanting to fight with Him. Çré Kåñëa ran from the Yavana, staying just barely beyond Kälayavana's grasp at every step and eventually leading him a long distance toward a mountain cave. As Kälayavana ran, he hurled insults at the Lord, but he could not grasp Him, since his stock of impious karma was not yet depleted. Çré Kåñëa entered the cave, whereupon Kälayavana followed after Him and saw a man lying on the ground. Taking him for Çré Kåñëa, Kälayavana kicked him. The man had been sleeping for a very long time, and now, having been violently awakened, he looked around angrily in all directions and saw Kälayavana. The man stared harshly at him, igniting a fire in Kälayavana's body and in a moment burning him to ashes."

Previously, he had spent many long years helping to protect the demigods from the demons. When the demigods had eventually obtained Kärttikeya as their protector, they allowed Mucukunda to retire, offering him any boon other than liberation, which only Lord Viñëu can bestow. Mucukunda had chosen from the demigods the benediction of being covered by sleep, and thus since then he had been lying asleep within the cave."

Mucukunda asked Lord Kåñëa who He was and also explained to the Lord his own identity. Mucukunda said, \"After growing weary from remaining awake for a long time, I was enjoying my sleep here in this cave when some stranger disturbed me and, suffering the reaction of his sins, was burnt to ashes. O Lord, O vanquisher of all enemies, it is my great fortune that I now have the vision of Your beautiful form.\""

My dear Mucukunda, you will have perpetual devotion for Me. Now, always remaining surrendered to Me, go perform penances to eradicate the sinful reactions incurred from the killing you had to do in your role as a warrior. In your next life you will become a first-class brähmaëa and attain Me.\" Thus the Lord offered Mucukunda His blessings."
