    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: Kälayavana saw the Lord come out from Mathurä like the rising moon. The Lord was most beautiful to behold, with His dark-blue complexion and yellow silk garment. Upon His chest He bore the mark of Çrévatsa, and the Kaustubha gem adorned His neck. His four arms were sturdy and long. He displayed His ever-joyful lotuslike face, with eyes pink like lotuses, beautifully effulgent cheeks, a pristine smile and glittering shark-shaped earrings. The barbarian thought, \"This person must indeed be Väsudeva, since He possesses the characteristics Närada mentioned: He is marked with Çrévatsa, He has four arms, His eyes are like lotuses, He wears a garland of forest flowers, and He is extremely handsome. He cannot be anyone else. Since He goes on foot and unarmed, I will fight Him without weapons.\" Resolving thus, he ran after the Lord, who turned His back and ran away. Kälayavana hoped to catch Lord Kåñëa, though great mystic yogés cannot attain Him.",

            "content": "Although Kälayavana was seeing Lord Kåñëa with his own eyes, he could not adequately appreciate the beautiful Lord. Thus instead of worshiping Kåñëa, he attacked Him. Similarly, it is not uncommon for modern men to attack Kåñëa in the name of philosophy, \"law and order\" and even religion."
