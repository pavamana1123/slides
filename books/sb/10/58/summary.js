The Päëòavas greeted the Lord and embraced Him in great ecstasy. Their new bride, Draupadé, shyly approached Kåñëa and bowed down to Him. Then the Päëòavas properly worshiped and welcomed Sätyaki and the Lord's other companions, offering them sitting places."

As Kunté-devi recalled the various miseries Duryodhana had inflicted upon her and her sons, she remarked that Kåñëa was their only protector. \"You are the well-wisher of the entire universe,\" she said, \"yet even though You are free from all delusion of 'mine' and 'another's,' You nonetheless reside within the hearts of those who meditate on You constantly, and from within their hearts You destroy all their miseries.\" Then Yudhiñöhira told Kåñëa, \"Only because we executed many pious acts are we able to see Your lotus feet, which even great yogés find it impossible to attain.\" Honored by King Yudhiñöhira, Çré Kåñëa happily remained as a guest in Indraprastha for several months."

On Kåñëa's request Arjuna went up to the girl and asked who she was. The beautiful maiden replied, \"I am Kälindé, the daughter of the sun-god. Hoping to attain Lord Viñëu as my husband, I have been performing severe austerities. I will accept no one else as my husband, and until He marries me I will remain in the Yamunä, living in a house my father built for me here.\" After Arjuna reported all this to Kåñëa, the omniscient Lord took Kälindé onto His chariot, and then the three of them returned to Yudhiñöhira's residence."

The Lord satisfied His beloved devotees by remaining with them there for some time. Then, to please Agni, the fire-god, Kåñëa arranged to offer him the Khäëòava forest. The Lord asked Arjuna to burn down the forest and accompanied him as his charioteer. Agni was so satisfied with the offering that he presented Arjuna with the Gäëòéva bow, a team of horses, a chariot, two inexhaustible quivers, and armor. While the Khäëòava forest burned, Arjuna saved a demon named Maya from the blaze. Maya Dänava reciprocated by building Arjuna a splendid palace. In this building Duryodhana would later get a good drenching after mistaking the surface of a pond for a solid floor, thus embarrassing himself."

The girl's relatives had laid down the stipulation that any man who could subdue a certain group of seven ferocious bulls would win her hand. When Kåñëa heard about this princess, He went to Ayodhyä with a large contingent of soldiers. King Nagnajit greeted Him hospitably and joyfully worshiped Him with various offerings. When Satyä saw Kåñëa, she immediately desired Him as her husband, and King Nagnajit, understanding his daughter's intentions, informed Lord Kåñëa of his own wish that the Lord and his daughter be married. The King affectionately told the Lord, \"You alone would be a suitable husband for my daughter, and if You subdue the seven bulls You may certainly marry her.\""

Just then the rival kings who had been defeated by the bulls tried to attack Lord Kåñëa. But Arjuna easily beat them back, and Kåñëa proceeded with Nägnajité to Dvärakä."
