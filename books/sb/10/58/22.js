From this incident we can appreciate the beautiful spiritual processes executed in previous ages by great souls. Unlike the so-called love in worldly \"love affairs,\" beautiful Kälindé's love for Lord Kåñëa was pure and perfect. Even though Kälindé was a tender young girl, her determination to marry Kåñëa was so strong that she arranged for her father to build her a house in the Yamunä where she could perform severe austerities until the day her beloved came."
