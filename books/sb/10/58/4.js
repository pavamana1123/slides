Because Yudhiñöhira and Bhéma were externally senior to Kåñëa, the Lord bowed down at their feet, whereas He embraced His peer Arjuna and accepted obeisances from the younger brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva. Sometimes inexperienced devotees think it is sinful to honor or bow down to an elder brother in Kåñëa consciousness. But from Lord Kåñëa's example here we may conclude that offering all respects to a senior brother in Kåñëa consciousness is not sinful."
