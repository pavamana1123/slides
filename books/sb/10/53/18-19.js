    "translation": "To secure the bride for Çiçupäla, the kings who envied Kåñëa and Balaräma came to the following decision among themselves: \"If Kåñëa comes here with Balaräma and the other Yadus to steal the bride, we shall band together and fight Him.\" Thus those envious kings went to the wedding with their entire armies and a full complement of military conveyances.",
