When Rukmiëé did not see Him come, she naturally feared that He had rejected her proposal, perhaps finding some unacceptable quality in her. As expressed here, the Lord Himself is anavadya, faultless, and if He saw some fault in Rukmiëé she would be an unworthy bride for Him. It was natural for the young princess to feel such anxiety. Furthermore, if Çré Kåñëa had actually made this decision, it would be natural for the brähmaëa to fear Rukmiëé's reaction were he to bring her the news, and that would explain why he had not come."
