Therefore I must kidnap her after crushing all the low-class kings, just as one might generate fire from wood by friction.\" Since the solemnizing of vows between Rukmiëé and Çiçupäla was scheduled to occur in only three days, Lord Kåñëa had Däruka ready His chariot at once. Then He immediately set out for Vidarbha, which He reached after one night's travel."

Bhéñmaka saw to all the necessary preparations: he had the city decorated in various ways and had its main roads and intersections thoroughly cleansed. Damaghoña, the King of Cedi, having also done everything necessary to prepare for his son's marriage, arrived in Vidarbha. King Bhéñmaka greeted him properly and gave him a place to stay. Many other kings, such as Jaräsandha, Çälva and Dantavakra, also came to witness the occasion. These enemies of Kåñëa had conspired to kidnap the bride if Kåñëa came. They planned to fight Him together and thus guarantee Çiçupäla his bride. Hearing of these plans, Lord Baladeva gathered His entire army and quickly went to Kuëòinapura."

After bowing down to the deity, Rukmiëé prayed to be allowed to have Çré Kåñëa as her husband. Then she took the hand of a girlfriend and left the Ambikä temple. Seeing her inexpressible beauty, the great heroes present dropped their weapons and fell to the ground unconscious. Rukmiëé walked with deliberate steps until she noticed Kåñëa. Then, as everyone looked on, Çré Kåñëa took Rukmiëé onto His chariot. Like a lion claiming his rightful share from a band of jackals, He drove back all the opposing kings and slowly made His exit, followed by His associates. Jaräsandha and the other kings, unable to bear their defeat and dishonor, loudly condemned themselves, declaring that this defamation was like a petty animal's stealing away what rightfully belongs to the lion."
