    "translation": "I am extremely unfortunate, for the creator is not favorably disposed toward me, nor is the great Lord Çiva. Or perhaps Çiva's wife, Devé, who is known as Gauré, Rudräëé, Girijä and Saté, has turned against me.",

But why should he be unfavorable? Perhaps it is Maheçvara, Lord Çiva, whom on some occasion I did not properly worship and who thus became angry with me. But he is Maheçvara, the great controller, so why would he be angry with such an insignificant and foolish girl as me?"

But after all, she is Rudräëé, the wife of Rudra, and her very name means 'one who makes everyone cry.' So perhaps she and Çiva want me to cry. But seeing that I am so miserable, about to give up my life, why don't they soften their attitude? The reason must be that Goddess Devé is Girijä, an adopted daughter, so why should she be soft-hearted? In her incarnation as Saté she gave up her body, so perhaps she now wants me to give up my body also.\""
