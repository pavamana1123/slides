But if the living entities were to thus have only temporary existence, then when one of them would die his remaining karma would simply vanish without being used up, and when a soul would be born he would appear with unaccountable karma he had done nothing to earn. Furthermore, a living being's liberation would amount to the total eradication of his identity and being."

And like the making and breaking of a pot, the \"birth\" of an individual soul consists of his first becoming covered by a material body, and his \"death,\" or liberation, consists of the destruction of his gross and subtle bodies once and for all. Certainly such \"birth\" and \"death\" take place only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord."

Just as the efficient cause, air, impels the ingredient cause, water, to form itself into bubbles, so by His glance the Supreme Puruña inspires prakåti to transform herself into the array of material elements and the innumerable material forms manifest from those elements. Prakåti thus serves as the upädäna-käraëa, or ingredient cause, of creation. In the ultimate issue, however, since she is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord, it is the Lord alone who is the ingredient cause as well as the efficient cause. This is as stated in the Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.2.1), tasmäd vä etasmäd ätmana äkäçaù sambhütaù: \"From this Supreme Soul the ether evolved,\" and so 'kämayata bahu syäà prajäyeya: \"He desired, 'Let Me become many by expanding into progeny.' \""

And in the same way as the infinitesimal jévas can appear to undergo birth and death without any factual change, the Supreme Lord can send forth and withdraw His emanations without Himself undergoing any transformation. Thus the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (4.5.14) affirms, avinäçi väre 'yam ätmä: \"This ätmä is indeed indestructible\"—a statement that can be applied to both the Supreme Soul and the subordinate jéva soul."

Partial dissolution occurs when the soul experiences dreamless sleep, when he leaves his body and when all souls reenter the body of Mahä-Viñëu at the time of universal annihilation. These different types of dissolution are like the mixing of nectar brought by bees from different kinds of flowers. The different flavors of nectar represent the dormant individual karmic reactions of each living entity, which still exist but cannot easily be distinguished from one another. In contrast, the ultimate dissolution of the soul's material condition is his liberation from saàsära, which is like the flowing of rivers into the ocean. As the waters from different rivers merge together after entering the ocean and become indistinguishable from one another, so the false material designations of the jévas are given up at the time of liberation and all the liberated jévas once again become equally situated as servants of the Supreme Lord."
