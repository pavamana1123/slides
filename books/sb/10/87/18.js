    "translation": "Among the followers of the methods set forth by great sages, those with less refined vision worship the Supreme as present in the region of the abdomen, while the Äruëis worship Him as present in the heart, in the subtle center from which all the präëic channels emanate. From there, O unlimited Lord, these worshipers raise their consciousness upward to the top of the head, where they can perceive You directly. Then, passing through the top of the head toward the supreme destination, they reach that place from which they will never again fall to this world, into the mouth of death.",

The various processes of yoga are for the most part gradual and full of opportunities for distraction. Authentic methods of yoga, nonetheless, all aim at meditation on the Supersoul (Paramätmä), whose primary residence is in the region of the heart, alongside the jéva soul. This manifestation of Paramätmä in the heart is very subtle and difficult to perceive (daharam), and thus only advanced yogés can realize Him there."

And just as the physical heart is the center of blood circulation, so the subtle heart—cakra is the crossroads of numerous channels of präëa, called näòés, which extend outward to all parts of the body. When these passageways have been sufficiently purified, the Äruëi yogés can leave the heart region and go upward to the cakra at the roof of the brain. Yogés who leave their bodies through this cakra, the brahma-randhra, go directly to the kingdom of God, from which they need never return to be reborn. Thus even the unsure process of meditational yoga can bear the fruit of pure devotion if it is followed perfectly."
