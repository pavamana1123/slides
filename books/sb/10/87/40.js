    "translation": "When a person realizes You, he no longer cares about his good and bad fortune arising from past pious and sinful acts, since it is You alone who control this good and bad fortune. Such a realized devotee also disregards what ordinary living beings say about him. Every day he fills his ears with Your glories, which are recited in each age by the unbroken succession of Manu's descendants, and thus You become his ultimate salvation.",

One may ask if this suffering is justified, since a renunciant's status should exempt him from suffering, whether or not he has a devotional attitude. As the çruti-mantra states, eña nityo mahimä brähmaëasya na karmaëä vardhate no kanéyän: \"The perpetual glory of a brähmaëa is never increased or diminished as a result of any of his activities.\" (Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad 4.4.28) To counter the objection thus raised, the personified Vedas offer this prayer."

The devotees hold firm to the Supreme Lord's lotus feet by their unrelenting Kåñëa consciousness, and so they need not strictly adhere to the ritual commands and prohibitions of the Vedas. They can fearlessly ignore the apparent good and bad reactions of the work they do only for the Supreme Lord's pleasure, and they can equally ignore whatever others may say about them, whether praise or condemnation. A humble Vaiñëava absorbed in the pleasure of saìkértana, glorification of the Lord, pays little heed to praise of himself, which he assumes mistaken, and happily accepts all criticism, which he deems appropriate."
