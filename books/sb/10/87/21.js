    "translation": "My Lord, some fortunate souls have gotten relief from the fatigue of material life by diving into the vast nectar ocean of Your pastimes, which You enact when You manifest Your personal forms to propagate the unfathomable science of the self. These rare souls, indifferent even to liberation, renounce the happiness of home and family because of their association with devotees who are like flocks of swans enjoying at the lotus of Your feet.",

Çréla Jéva Gosvämé here defines ätma-tattva as the confidential mystery of the Supreme Lord's personal forms, qualities and pastimes. He also gives a second meaning for the phrase ätta-tanoù. Instead of meaning \"who assumes various bodies,\" the phrase can also mean \"He who attracts everyone to His transcendental body.\""

When a person comes to the point of complete exhaustion in his materialistic pursuits—whether he has been searching after material success or some impersonal notion of spiritual annihilation—he can gain relief by submerging himself in this nectar. As Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé explains in his textbook on the science of bhakti-yoga, Çré Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (rendered into English by Çréla Prabhupäda as The Nectar of Devotion), one who tastes even a single drop of this vast ocean will forever lose all desire for anything else."

Rather, their very fatigue becomes pleasure for them, just as the fatigue produced by sex indulgence is pleasurable to those addicted to sex. The Supreme Lord's pure devotees become enthused by hearing the charming narrations of His pastimes and feel impelled to dance, sing, shout out loud, kick their heels together, faint, sob and run about like madmen. Thus they become too absorbed in ecstasy to notice any bodily discomfort."

This degree of exclusive dedication is admittedly only rarely achieved in this world, as the çrutis speaking this verse indicate by the word kecit (\"a few\"). Not only do pure devotees abandon their hankering for future gain, but they also lose all their attraction for what they already possess—the common comforts of home and family life. The association of saintly Vaiñëavas—the disciplic succession of masters, disciples and granddisciples—becomes for them their real family, filled with swanlike personalities like Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé. These great personalities always drink the sweet nectar of service to the Supreme Lord's lotus feet."
