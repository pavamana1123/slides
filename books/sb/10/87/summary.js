In reply, Çukadeva Gosvämé described an ancient encounter between Çré Näräyaëa Åñi and Närada Muni at Badarikäçrama. Traveling to that sacred hermitage, Närada found the Lord surrounded by exalted residents of the nearby village of Kaläpa. After bowing down to Näräyaëa Åñi and His associates, Närada submitted this same question to Him. In reply, Näräyaëa Åñi related an account of how this very question had been discussed long ago among the great sages living on Janaloka. Once these sages, feeling inquisitive about the nature of the Absolute Truth, chose Sanandana Kumära to speak on the subject. Sanandana told them how the numerous personified Vedas, appearing as the first emanations from the breathing of Lord Näräyaëa, recited prayers for His glorification just before the creation. Sanandana then proceeded to recite these elaborate prayers."

Närada Muni was equally satisfied to hear this account from Çré Näräyaëa Åñi. Thus Närada offered his obeisances to the Lord and then went to see his disciple Vedavyäsa, to whom he explained everything he had heard."
