    "translation": "He is the Lord who eternally watches over this universe, who exists before, during and after its manifestation. He is the master of both the unmanifest material energy and the spirit soul. After sending forth the creation He enters within it, accompanying each living entity. There He creates the material bodies and then remains as their regulator. By surrendering to Him one can escape the embrace of illusion, just as a dreaming person forgets his own body. One who wants liberation from fear should constantly meditate upon Him, Lord Hari, who is always on the platform of perfection and thus never subject to material birth.",

For those who seek transcendental knowledge, He provides the intelligence by which they can merge into the spiritual effulgence of God, thus attaining liberation. And for the devotees He provides the understanding that leads them to His pure devotional service."

Thus the Lord is the nimitta-käraëam, or effective cause, of creation. He is also the upädäna-käraëam, the ingredient cause, inasmuch as everything emanates from Him and He alone is constantly present before, during and after the manifestation of the created cosmos. Lord Näräyaëa Himself states this in the Catuù-çloké Bhägavatam:"

When he turns to the Lord's worship, he becomes anuçayé in a different sense: fallen like a rod to pay obeisances at the Lord's feet. By that surrender the soul easily casts illusion aside. Even though the liberated soul may still seem to be living in a material body, the connection he has with it is only an external appearance; he pays no more regard to it than a sleeping man pays to his body while busily engaged far, far away in his dream-world."

Sometimes one can achieve this state only by a severe effort that takes many lifetimes, but in some cases the Lord may show special consideration for one He favors, regardless of how little credit that soul may have earned by regulated practice. In the words of Çré Bhéñmadeva, yam iha nirékñya hatä gatäù svarüpam: \"Those who simply saw Kåñëa on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra attained their original forms after being killed.\"  That even demons like Agha, Baka and Keçé were liberated by Lord Kåñëa without having performed any spiritual practices is an indication of His unique position as the original Personality of Godhead. Knowing this, we should put aside all fear and doubt and give ourselves fully to the process of devotional service."
