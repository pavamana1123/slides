    "translation": "Çré Sanandana replied: After the Supreme Lord withdrew the universe He had previously created, He lay for some time as if asleep, and all His energies rested dormant within Him. When the time came for the next creation, the personified Vedas awakened Him by chanting His glories, just as the poets serving a king approach him at dawn and awaken him by reciting his heroic deeds.",

            "content": "At the time of creation, the Vedas are the first emanation from the breathing of Lord Mahä-Viñëu, and in personified form they serve Him by waking Him from His mystic sleep. This statement made by Sanandana implies that Sanaka and the other sages had asked him the same question that Närada had asked Näräyaëa Åñi and Mahäräja Parékñit had asked Çukadeva Gosvämé. Sanandana refers the question back to the example of the personified Vedas themselves in their address to Lord Mahä-Viñëu. Even though the Vedas knew that the Lord, being omniscient, does not need to be informed of His glories, they enthusiastically took this opportunity to praise Him."
