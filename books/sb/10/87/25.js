    "translation": "Supposed authorities who declare that matter is the origin of existence, that the permanent qualities of the soul can be destroyed, that the self is compounded of separate aspects of spirit and matter, or that material transactions constitute reality—all such authorities base their teachings on mistaken ideas that hide the truth. The dualistic conception that the living entity is produced from the three modes of nature is simply a product of ignorance. Such a conception has no real basis in You, for You are transcendental to all illusion and always enjoy perfect, total awareness.",

Most thinkers are mistaken in one way or another about these truths, since there are countless varieties of false designation that can cover the soul and create illusion. Foolish conditioned souls submit to obvious delusions, but the illusory power of Mäyä can easily subvert the intelligence of even the most sophisticated philosophers and mystics. Thus there are always divergent schools of thought propounding conflicting theories concerning basic principles of truth."

The Vaiçeñikas say that the visible universe is created from an original stock of atoms (janim asataù). As Kaëäda Åñi's Vaiçeñika-sütras (7.1.20) state, nityaà parimaëòalam: \"That which is of the smallest size, the atom, is eternal. \" Kaëäda and his followers also postulate eternality for other, nonatomic entities, including the souls who become embodied, and even a Supreme Soul. But in Vaiçeñika cosmology the souls and the Supersoul play only token roles in the atomic production of the universe. Çréla Kåñëa-dvaipäyana Vedavyäsa criticizes this position in his Vedänta-sütras (2.2.12): ubhayathäpi na karmätas tad-abhävaù. According to this sütra, one cannot claim that, at the time of creation, atoms first combine together because they are impelled by some karmic impulse adhering in the atoms themselves, since atoms by themselves, in their primeval state before combining into complex objects, have no ethical responsibility that might lead them to acquire pious and sinful reactions. Nor can the initial combination of atoms be explained as a result of the residual karma of the living entities who lie dormant prior to creation, since these reactions are each jéva's own and cannot be transferred from them even to other jévas, what to speak of inert atoms."

Éçvara-praëidhänäd vä: \"Devotional meditation on God is yet another means of achieving concentration.\" (Yoga-sütra 1.23) In contrast, Bädaräyaëa Vedavyäsa's philosophy of Vedänta emphasizes devotional service not only as the primary means to liberation but also as identical with liberation itself. Ä-präyaëät taträpi hi dåñöam: \"Worship of the Lord continues up to the point of liberation, and indeed goes on in the liberated state also, as the Vedas reveal.\" (Vedänta-sütra 4.1.12)Gautama Åñi, in his Nyäya-sutras, proposes that one can attain liberation by negating both illusion and unhappiness: duùkha-janma-pravåtti-doña-mithyä-jïänänäm uttarottaräpäye tad-anantaräbhäväd apavargaù. \"By successively dispelling false conceptions, bad character, entangling action, rebirth and misery—the disappearance of one of these allowing the disappearance of the next—one can achieve final liberation.\" (Nyäya-sutra 1.1.2) But since Nyäya philosophers believe that awareness is not an essential quality of the soul, they teach that a liberated soul has no consciousness. The Nyäya idea of liberation thus puts the soul in the condition of a dead stone. This attempt by the Nyäya philosophers to kill the soul's innate consciousness is here called sato måtim by the personified Vedas. But the Vedänta-sütra (2.3.17) unequivocally states, jïo 'ta eva: \"The jéva soul is always a knower.\""

Why? Because the injunctions of scripture must have some purpose (çästrärtha-vattvät). For example, such scriptural injunctions as svarga-kämo yajeta ('One who desires to attain to heaven should perform ritual sacrifice') and ätmänam eva lokam upäséta (Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad 1.4.15: 'One should worship with the aim of attaining the spiritual kingdom') are meaningful only if a conscious doer exists. If the modes of nature were the doer, these statements would serve no purpose. After all, scriptural injunctions engage the living entity in performing prescribed actions by convincing him that he can act to bring about certain enjoyable results. Such a mentality cannot be aroused in the inert modes of nature.\""

For them the cycle of karma is perpetual, and the best one can aim for is higher birth among the demigods. Therefore, they say, the whole purpose of the Vedas is to engage human beings in rituals for creating good karma, and consequently the mature soul's prime responsibility is to ascertain the exact meaning of the Vedas' sacrificial injunctions and to execute them.
