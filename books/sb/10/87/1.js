In the first, sat is taken to mean \"devotee of the Supreme Lord,\" and thus san-märgam means \"the path of bhakti-yoga, devotional service.\" In the second, with sat meaning \"a seeker of transcendental knowledge,\" san-märgam means \"the philosophical path of knowledge,\" which has impersonal Brahman as its object. And in the third, with sat referring to the transcendental sound of the Vedas, san-märgam means \"the process of following Vedic injunctions.\" Both the second and the third of these interpretations of san-märgam lead to the question of how the Vedas can describe the Absolute Truth."

These are the different ways a word refers to its meaning, distinguished as mukhya-våtti, lakñaëä-våtti and gauëa-våtti. The çabda-våtti termed mukhya is the primary, literal meaning of a word; this is also known as abhidhä, a word's \"denotation,\" or dictionary meaning. Mukhya-våtti is further divided into two subcategories, namely rüòhi and yoga. A primary meaning is called rüòhi when it is based on conventional usage, and yoga when it is derived from another word's meaning by regular etymological rules."

        {
            "type": "normal",
            "content": "For example, the word go (\"cow\") is an example of rüòhi, since its relation with its literal meaning is purely conventional. The denotation of the word päcaka (\"chef\"), on the other hand, is a yoga-våtti, through the word's derivation from the root pac (\"to cook\") by addition of the agent suffix -ka."
        },
        {
            "type": "normal",
            "content": "Beside its mukhya-våtti, or primary meaning, a word can also be used in a secondary, metaphorical sense. This usage is called lakñaëä. The rule is that a word should not be understood metaphorically if its mukhya-våtti makes sense in the given context; only after the mukhya-våtti fails to convey a word's meaning may lakñaëä-våtti be justifiably presumed. The function of lakñaëä is technically explained in the kävya-çästras as an extended reference, pointing to something in some way related to the object of the literal meaning. Thus, the phrase gaìgäyäà ghoñaù literally means \"the cowherd village in the Ganges.\" But that idea is absurd, so here gaìgäyäm should rather be understood by its lakñaëä to mean \"on the bank of the Ganges,\" the bank being something related to the river. Gauëa-våtti is a special kind of lakñaëä, where the meaning is extended to some idea of similarity. For example, in the statement siàho devadattaù (\"Devadatta is a lion\"), heroic Devadatta is metaphorically called a lion because of his lionlike qualities. In contrast, the example of the general kind of lakñaëä, namely gaìgäyäà ghoñaù, involves a relationship not of similarity but of location."

He asks, kathaà säkñät caranti: How can the Vedas directly describe Brahman by rüòha-mukhya-våtti, literal meaning based on convention? After all, the Absolute is anirdeçya, inaccessible to designation. And how can the Vedas even describe Brahman by gauëa-våtti, metaphor based on similar qualities?"

Furthermore, Parékñit Mahäräja points out that Brahman is sad-asataù param, beyond all causes and effects. Having no connection with any manifest existence, subtle or gross, the Absolute cannot be expressed by either yoga-våtti, a meaning derived etymologically, or lakñaëä, metaphor, since both require some relationship of Brahman to other entities."
