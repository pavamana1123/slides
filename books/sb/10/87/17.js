The soul undoubtedly is alive, and irrevocably so, but in his ignorance that inner life is covered and forgotten. In its place, the automation of the external mind and body carries out the dictates of the modes of nature, which force one to act in a way altogether irrelevant to the dormant needs of the soul.

[These are enumerated in the Brahmänanda-vallé of the Taittiréya Upaniñad.] In the beginning of life, every living entity is food conscious. A child or an animal is satisfied only by getting nice food. This stage of consciousness, in which the goal is to eat sumptuously, is called anna-maya. Anna means 'food.' After this one lives in the consciousness of being alive. If one can continue his life without being attacked or destroyed, one thinks himself happy. This stage is called präëa-maya, or consciousness of one's existence. After this stage, when one is situated on the mental platform, that consciousness is called mano-maya. The material civilization is primarily situated in these three stages—annamaya, präëa-maya and mano-maya. The first concern of civilized persons is economic development, the next concern is defense against being annihilated, and the next consciousness is mental speculation, the philosophical approach to the values of life."

            "content": "\"If by the evolutionary process of philosophical life one happens to reach to the platform of intellectual life and understands that he is not this material body, but is a spirit soul, one is situated in the vijïäna-maya stage. Then by evolution of spiritual life he comes to understand the Supreme Lord, or the Supreme Soul. When one develops his relationship with Him and executes devotional service, that stage of life is called Kåñëa consciousness, the änanda-maya stage. Änanda-maya is the blissful life of knowledge and eternity. As it is said in the Vedänta-sütra, änanda-mayo 'bhyäsät. The Supreme Brahman and the subordinate Brahman, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entities, are both joyful by nature. As long as the living entities are situated in the lower four stages of life—anna-maya, präëa-maya, mano-maya and vijïäna-maya—they are considered to be in the material condition of life, but as soon as one reaches the stage of änanda-maya he becomes a liberated soul. This änanda-maya stage is explained in the Bhagavad-gétä as the brahma-bhüta stage. There it is said that in the brahma-bhüta  stage of life there is no anxiety and no hankering. This stage begins when one becomes equally disposed toward all living entities, and it then expands to the stage of Kåñëa consciousness, in which one hankers to render service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This hankering for advancement in devotional service is not the same as hankering for sense gratification in material existence. In other words, hankering remains in spiritual life, but it becomes purified. When our senses are purified, they become freed from all material stages, namely anna-maya, präëa-maya, mano-maya and vijïäna-maya, and they become situated in the highest stage—änanda-maya, or blissful life in Kåñëa consciousness."

Merging into the spiritual existence is the living entity's realization of qualitative oneness with the Supreme Lord in His eternity and knowledge aspects. But the actual änanda-maya (blissful) stage is obtained when one is engaged in devotional service. That is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä: mad-bhaktià labhate paräm . The brahma-bhüta änanda-maya stage is complete only when there is the exchange of love between the Supreme and the subordinate living entities. Unless one comes to this änanda-maya stage of life, his breathing is like the breathing of a bellows in a blacksmith's shop, his duration of life is like that of a tree, and he is no better than the lower animals like the camels, hogs and dogs.\""

In this second sense He is the änanda-maya alone, the last of the five koças. Therefore the çrutis address Him here as avaçeñam, the residual essence. This is also expressed in the text of the Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.7): raso vai saù. Within His personal essence, the Supreme Lord enjoys rasa, the reciprocation of the mellows of devotional service, and integral to the play of rasas is the participation of realized jévas.

The Gopäla-täpané çruti (Uttara 96) states, yo 'sau jägrat-svapna-suñuptim atétya turyätéto gopälaù: \"Lord Kåñëa, the cowherd, transcends not only the material consciousness of wakefulness, dream and deep sleep, but also the fourth realm of pure, spiritual awareness.\" The änanda-maya Supersoul is simply an aspect of the primeval Lord Govinda, as declared by Him, viñöabhyäham idaà kåtsnam ekäàçena sthito jagat: \"With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.\" The çrutis thus tactfully assert that even among the various personal forms of Godhead, Kåñëa is supreme.
