    "translation": "The illusory material nature attracts the minute living entity to embrace her, and as a result he assumes forms composed of her qualities. Subsequently, he loses all his spiritual qualities and must undergo repeated deaths. You, however, avoid the material energy in the same way that a snake abandons its old skin. Glorious in Your possession of eight mystic perfections, You enjoy unlimited opulences.",

When he becomes entranced by the allurements of Mäyä, he accepts bodies and senses that are designed to let him indulge in forgetfulness. Produced from the raw material of Mäyä's three modes—goodness, passion and nescience—these bodies envelop the spirit soul in varieties of unhappiness, culminating in death and rebirth."

Smoke may engulf the glow of a small molten sphere of copper, covering its light in darkness, but the vast globe of the sun will never suffer the same kind of eclipse. Mäyä, after all, is the Personality of Godhead's faithful maidservant, the outward expansion of His internal, Yogamäyä potency. Çré Närada Païcarätra thus states, in a conversation between Çruti and Vidyä,"

Therefore, the shadow of material darkness has no scope for entering the domain of His unequaled, resplendent glories."
