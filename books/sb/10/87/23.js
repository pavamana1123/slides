But after hearing the other çrutis offer prayers openly glorifying the Lord's personality, these intimate çrutis could no longer contain themselves, and so they spoke out of turn in this verse."

If they succeed in thoroughly purifying themselves by this regimen, they may eventually begin to realize the Paramätmä, the personal form of Brahman within the heart. And if they continue this meditation without deviation for a long time, they may in the end come to the point of true God consciousness. But the same objective achieved in this difficult and uncertain way was also attained by the demons who were killed by Lord Kåñëa during His pastimes on the earth. Obsessed with enmity toward Him, demons like Kaàsa and Çiçupäla quickly obtained the perfection of liberation simply by His killing them."
