Thus it is toward You alone that the Vedic sages direct all their thoughts, words and acts. After all, how can the footsteps of men fail to touch the earth on which they live?",

As indicated here by the word tvayi, Lord Viñëu alone is the Absolute Truth. Indra and other demigods may be glorified in various ways, but they possess only those powers Lord Çré Viñëu has granted them."

He exists before and after the material manifestation as the constant basis, known to philosophers as the \"ingredient cause,\" upädäna.

Eventually, the pots and other objects will be destroyed and return to the clay from which they came. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the total ingredient cause, yet He remains eternally untouched by transformation. This is the purport of the statement sarvaà khalv idaà brahma: \"Everything is Brahman.\" (Chändogya Upaniñad 3.14.1) Wondering at this mystery, the great devotee Gajendra prayed,"

As the Chändogya Upaniñad affirms in its statements måttikety eva satyam and sarvaà khalv idaà brahma, reality is understood properly when everything is seen to be dependent on Brahman, the Absolute, for its existence. Brahman alone is real, not because nothing we see in this world is real, but because Brahman is the absolute, final cause of everything. Thus the word satyam, as used in the phrase måttikety eva satyam, has been defined in another context as \"ingredient cause\" by no less an authority than Lord Kåñëa Himself:"

Everything is resting on Brahman, but Brahman itself is resting on Kåñëa. Therefore Kåñëa is the ultimate Brahman, or Parabrahman. The material elements are accepted as inferior energies of Kåñëa because by their interaction the cosmic manifestation takes place, rests on Kåñëa, and after dissolution again enters into the body of Kåñëa as His subtle energy.
