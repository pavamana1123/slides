Similarly, ätmano gatim means both the destination of the jéva soul and the means of reaching the Supreme Soul. By hearing the twenty-eight prayers of the personified Vedas, which comprise the elucidation of the brahmopaniñat spoken at the beginning of this chapter, the sages assembled in Brahmaloka made great progress toward their goal of pure love of God."
