As stated here, Viñëu is the independent Lord (prabhu), and the living entities are His jana, dependents. Thus we should understand that the Lord creates the cosmos entirely for the living entities' sake; compassion is His sole motive."

In each body the conditioned soul utilizes his senses for enjoyment, and when he comes to the human form he must also discharge various duties assigned to him at the different stages of his life. If he faithfully discharges his duties, he earns more refined and extensive enjoyment in the future; if not, he is degraded. And when the soul eventually hankers to be freed from material life, the path of liberation is always available. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments that in this verse the repeated use of the word ca (\"and\") indicates the importance of all of what the Lord provides—not only the path of liberation, but also the paths of gradual elevation through religious life and appropriate sense enjoyment."

Far from presenting the Absolute Truth as ultimately impersonal, the Upaniñads speak at great length about His personal qualities. The Absolute described by the Upaniñads is free from all inferior, material qualities, and yet He is omniscient, omnipotent, the master and controller of all, the universally worshipable Lord, He who awards the results of everyone's work, and the reservoir of all eternity, knowledge and bliss. The Muëòaka Upaniñad (1.1.9) states, yaù sarva-jïaù sa sarva-vid yasya jïäna-mayaà tapaù: \"He who is all-knowing, from whom the potency of all knowledge comes—He is the wisest of all.\" In the words of the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (4.4.22, 3.7.3, and 1.2.4), sarvasya väçé sarvasyeçänaù: \"He is the Lord and controller of everyone\"; yaù påthivyäà tiñöhan påthivyä äntaraù: \"He who resides within the earth and pervades it\"; and so 'kämayata bahu syäm: \"He desired, 'I will become many. ' \" Similarly, the Aitareya Upaniñad (3.11) states, sa aikñata tat tejo 'såjata: \"He glanced at His potency, who then manifested the creation,\" while the Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.1.1) declares, satyaà jïänam anantaà brahma: \"The Supreme is unlimited truth and knowledge.\""

Çaìkaräcärya and his followers elevate these words to the status of one of the few mahä-väkyas, key phrases they say express the essential purport of Vedänta. The leading thinkers of the standard Vaiñëava schools of Vedänta, however, vociferously disagree with this interpretation. Äcäryas Rämänuja, Madhva, Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa and others have offered numerous alternative explanations according to a systematic study of the Upaniñads and other çrutis."

But Çukadeva Gosvämé's answer is not actually irrelevant, as Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains. Answers to subtle questions must often be phrased indirectly. As Lord Kåñëa Himself states in His instructions to Uddhava , parokña-vädä åñayaù parokñaà mama ca priyam: \"The Vedic seers and mantras deal in esoteric terms, and I also am pleased by such confidential descriptions.\" In the present context, the impersonalists, on whose behalf Parékñit Mahäräja asked his question, cannot appreciate the direct answer, so instead Çréla Çukadeva gives an indirect reply: \"You say that Brahman is indescribable by words. But if the Supreme Lord had not created the intelligence, mind and senses, then sound and the other objects of perception would all be just as indescribable as your Brahman. You would have been blind and deaf since birth, and would know nothing about physical forms and sounds, what to speak of the Absolute. So, just as the merciful Lord has given us all faculties of perception for experiencing and describing to others the sensations of sight, sound and so forth, in the same way He may give someone the receptive capacity to realize Brahman. He may, if He chooses, create some extraordinary way for words to function—apart from their ordinary references to material substances, qualities, categories and actions—that will enable them to express the Supreme Truth. He is, after all, the almighty Lord (prabhu), and He can easily make the indescribable describable.\""

He wore a garland of forest flowers, and His beauty was enhanced by His pose of meditative silence.\" The transcendental intelligence and senses of the Lord's perfect devotees correctly perceive His purely spiritual beauty, and their realizations are echoed in the Gopäla-täpané-çruti's comparison of Lord Kåñëa's eyes, body and clothing to a lotus, a cloud and lightning. On the other hand, devotees on the level of sädhana, who are in the process of becoming purified, have only barely realized the Supreme Lord's boundless spiritual beauty. Nonetheless, by hearing scriptural passages such as this one from the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad, they engage in contemplating Him to the best of their fledgling ability. Although the neophyte devotees have not yet learned how to fully realize the Lord or meditate steadily on even the effulgence surrounding His body, still they take pleasure in presuming, \"We are meditating on our Lord.\" And the Supreme Lord, moved by the waves of His boundless mercy, Himself thinks, \"These devotees are meditating on Me.\" When their devotion matures, He draws them to His feet to engage in His intimate service. Thus it is concluded that the Vedas have access to the personal identity of the Supreme only by His mercy."
