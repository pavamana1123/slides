    "translation": "Since this universe did not exist prior to its creation and will no longer exist after its annihilation, we conclude that in the interim it is nothing more than a manifestation imagined to be visible within You, whose spiritual enjoyment never changes. We liken this universe to the transformation of various material substances into diverse forms. Certainly those who believe that this figment of the imagination is substantially real are less intelligent.",

Before the creation of the universe and after its dissolution, only the spiritual reality of the Supreme Lord, along with His abode and entourage, continue to exist. The çrutis confirm this: ätmä va idam eka evägra äsét. \"Prior to the creation of this universe, only the Self existed.\" (Aitareya Upaniñad 1.1) Näsad äsén no sad äsét tadäném: \"At that time neither the subtle nor the gross aspects of matter were present.\" (Åg Veda 10.129.1)"

When basic materials like clay and metal are processed and shaped into various products, the created objects exist separately from the clay and metal only in name and form. The basic substance remains unchanged. Similarly, when the energies of the Supreme Lord are transformed into the known things of this world, these things exist separately from Him only in name and form. In the Chändogya Upaniñad (6.1.4-6), the sage Udälaka explains a similar analogy to his son: yathä saumyaikena måtpiëòena sarvaà mån-mayaà vijïätam syäd väcärambhaëaà vikäro nämadheyaà måttikety eva satyam. \"For example, my dear boy, by understanding a single lump of clay one can understand everything made from clay. The existence of transformed products is only a creation of language, a matter of assigning designations: the clay alone is real.\""
