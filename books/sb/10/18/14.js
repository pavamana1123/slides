Another pastime would occur at noon, while Lord Kåñëa was taking rest. Nearby, the young cowherd girls would be passing by, singing, and Kåñëa's boyfriends would pretend to inquire from them about the price of milk. Then the boys would steal yogurt and other items from them and run away. Kåñëa, Balaräma and Their friends would also play games in which they would cross the river in boats."

The word netra-bandha indicates a game in which one boy would approach a blindfolded boy from behind and place his palms over the blindfolded boy's eyes. Then, simply by the feel of his palms, the blindfolded boy would have to guess who the other boy was. In all such games the boys put up stakes for the winner, such as flutes or walking sticks. Sometimes the boys would imitate the various fighting methods of the forest animals, and at other times they would chirp like birds."
