At that time Lord Çré Kåñëa would become absorbed in various sports, surrounded by Balaräma and all the cowherd boys. One day they were intently dancing, singing and playing when a demon named Pralamba entered their midst, disguised as a cowherd boy. The omniscient Lord Kåñëa saw through the disguise, but even as He thought of how to kill the demon, He treated him as a friend."

            "content": "Kåñëa then suggested to His young friends and Baladeva that they play a game involving contending parties. Taking the role of leaders, Kåñëa and Balaräma divided the boys into two groups and determined that the losers would have to carry the winners on their shoulders. Thus when Çrédämä and Våñabha, members of Balaräma's party, were victorious, Kåñëa and another boy in His party carried them on their shoulders. Pralambäsura thought that the unconquerable Lord Çré Kåñëa would be too great an opponent to contend with, so the demon fought with Balaräma instead and was defeated. Taking Lord Balaräma on his back, Pralambäsura began to walk away very swiftly. But Balaräma became as heavy as Mount Sumeru, and the demon, unable to carry Him, had to reveal his true, demoniac form. When Balaräma saw this terrible form, He struck the demon a ferocious blow on the head with His fist. This blow shattered Pralambäsura's head just as lightning bolts hurled by the king of the demigods shatter mountains. The demon repeatedly vomited blood and then fell upon the ground. When the cowherd boys saw Lord Balaräma return, they joyfully embraced and congratulated Him as the demigods showered garlands of flowers from the heavens and glorified Him."
