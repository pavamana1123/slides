They would also sometimes jump about (laìghanaiù). The word kñepaiù indicates that sometimes they would hurl objects like balls or stones and that sometimes they would grab each other by the arms and throw one another about. Äsphoöana means that sometimes they would slap one another's shoulders or backs, and vikarñaëaiù indicates they would drag one another about in the midst of their play. By the word niyuddhena arm wrestling and other types of friendly fighting are indicated, and the word käka-pakña-dharau means that Kåñëa and Balaräma would sometimes grab the hair on the other boys' heads in a playful manner."
