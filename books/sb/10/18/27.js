Also because the demon had appeared as a cowherd boyfriend of Kåñëa's and because Kåñëa had accepted him as a friend, Baladeva was slightly apprehensive about killing him. Balaräma could also have been worried that since this cowherd boy was actually a demon in disguise, at that very moment another such demon might have been attacking Lord Kåñëa Himself. Thus the omniscient and omnipotent Supreme Lord Balaräma exhibited the pastime of becoming slightly nervous in the presence of the horrible demon Pralamba."
