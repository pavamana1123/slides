All material bodies go through six phases: birth, growth, maturity, reproduction, decline and destruction. But Lord Kåñëa does not take material birth, since He is the original reality, a fact clearly indicated here by the word adya, \"original.\" We take our material birth within a particular material atmosphere, in material bodies that are amalgamations of various material elements. Since Lord Kåñëa existed long before the creation of any material atmosphere or element, there is no question of material birth for His transcendental body."

            "content": "Similarly, the word pürëa, meaning \"full and complete,\" refutes the concept that Lord Kåñëa could grow, since He is ever-existing in fullness. When one's material body becomes mature, one can no longer enjoy as in youth; but the words ajasra-sukha, \"enjoying unobstructed happiness,\" indicate that Lord Kåñëa's body never reaches so-called middle age, since it is always full of spiritual youthful bliss. The word akñara, \"undiminishing,\" refutes the possibility that Lord Kåñëa's body grows old or declines, and the word amåta, \"immortal\" negates the possibility of death."

            "content": "In other words, Lord Kåñëa's transcendental body is free from the transformations of material bodies. The Lord does, however, create innumerable worlds and expand Himself as innumerable living entities. But the Lord's so-called reproduction is completely spiritual and does not take place at a certain phase of bodily existence; rather, it constitutes the Lord's eternal proclivity to expand His spiritual bliss and glories."

            "content": "As the Lord states in çruti, pürvam eväham ihäsam: \"I alone existed in the beginning.\" Therefore here the Lord is called puruñaù puräëaù, \"the primeval enjoyer. \"This original puruña expands Himself as the Supersoul and enters every living being. Still, He is ultimately the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa, as stated in the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad: yaù säkñät para-brahmeti govindaà sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaà våndävana-sura-bhüruha-taläsénam. \"The Absolute Truth Himself is Govinda, who has an eternal form of bliss and knowledge and who is sitting beneath the shady desire trees of Våndävana.\" This Absolute Truth is beyond material ignorance and beyond even ordinary spiritual knowledge, as stated in the same Gopäla-täpané çruti: vidyävidyäbhyäà bhinnaù. Thus, in many ways the supremacy of Lord Kåñëa has been established in the Vedic literature, and it is here confirmed by Lord Brahmä himself."
