    "translation": "My greatest possible good fortune would be to take any birth whatever in this forest of Gokula and have my head bathed by the dust falling from the lotus feet of any of its residents.

Being realistic, Lord Brahmä does not aspire to directly achieve the dust of Lord Kåñëa's feet; rather, he aspires for the mercy of the Lord's devotees. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that Brahmä is willing to take birth even as a stone in a paved footpath in the Lord's abode. Since Brahmä is the creator of the entire universe, we can just imagine the glorious position of the residents of Våndävana."

One cannot achieve such spiritual opulence by any puffed-up material process of personal improvement. In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda reveals the mind of Brahmä as follows: \"But if I am not so fortunate as to take birth within the forest of Våndävana, I beg to be allowed to take birth outside the immediate area of Våndävana so that when the devotees go out they will walk over me. Even that would be a great fortune for me. I am just aspiring for a birth in which I will be smeared by the dust of the devotees' feet.\""
