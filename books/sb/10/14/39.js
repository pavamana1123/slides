I may be master of this universe, but there are innumerable universes, and there are also innumerable Brahmäs who preside over these universes. But actually You are the master of them all. As the Supersoul in everyone's heart, You know everything. Please, therefore, accept me as Your surrendered servant. I hope that You will excuse me for disturbing You in Your pastimes with Your friends and calves. Now if You will kindly allow me, I will immediately leave so You can enjoy Your friends and calves without my presence.\""

Lord Kåñëa knows everything and sees everything, and therefore Lord Brahmä did not need to remain in Våndävana to maintain his personal loving contact with the Lord. In fact, as the creator of the universe, Lord Brahmä was somewhat out of place in the simple, blissful atmosphere of Våndävana, where Lord Kåñëa was exhibiting His supreme opulences in herding cows, enjoying picnics, playing games and so on."

            "content": "Upon seeing the intense love the residents of Våndävana had for Lord Kåñëa, Brahmä felt unqualified to remain there. He was not eager to give up the Lord's association, but he felt it better to return to his personal devotional service in Brahmaloka. Somewhat embarrassed and unhappy over his foolish attempt at bewildering the Lord, Brahmä preferred to resume his transcendental loving service rather than try to enjoy the Lord's presence."
