            "content": "Lord Brahmä here describes the inconceivable spiritual potency of the Lord. We may find a pot within a house, but we can hardly expect to find the house within the same pot. By the Lord's spiritual potency, however, He can appear within this universe and simultaneously exhibit all the universes within His body. One may argue that since the universes seen by mother Yaçodä within Lord Kåñëa's abdomen were within the Lord's body, they are different from the illusory material universes manifest externally. Here Lord Brahmä refutes that argument, however. Lord Kåñëa is mäyä-dhamana, the supreme controller of illusion. By the Lord's own supreme mystic potency, He can bewilder even illusion herself, and thus the Lord actually exhibited all the material universes within His body. This is mäyätvam, the supreme bewildering potency of the Personality of Godhead."
