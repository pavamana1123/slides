It is stated in this verse that the original cowherd boyfriends and calves were situated just as before: near the bank of the Yamunä River and in the forest, respectively. Previously the calves had disappeared within the forest and Lord Kåñëa had gone to search for them. Not finding them, the Lord had returned to the riverbank to discuss the situation with His cowherd boyfriends, but they had also disappeared. Now the cows were once again in the forest and the boyfriends once again on the bank of the river, ready to take their lunch. According to Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, the calves and boys remained in the forest and on the riverbank, respectively, for one full year. Lord Brahmä did not actually take them away to another place. By the Lord's omnipotent illusory energy, the gopés and other residents of Våndävana did not notice the calves and boys, nor did the calves and boys notice the passing of a year's time or feel any hunger, cold or thirst. All this was part of the pastime arranged by the Lord's illusory potency. Lord Brahmä thought, \"I have kept all the boys and calves of Gokula sleeping on the bed of my mystic potency, and to this very day they have not risen. A similar number of boys and calves have been playing with Kåñëa for one whole year, yet they are different from the ones illusioned by my mystic potency. Who are they? Where did they come from?\""

After Brahmä surrendered and offered prayers, Lord Kåñëa returned to the original boys and calves, who appeared exactly as before, although their size had somewhat increased because of one year's growth."

Kåñëa's silence indicates the following thoughts: \"Where did this four-headed Brahmä come from? What is he doing? What are these words he keeps on speaking? I am busy looking for My calves. I am just a cowherd boy and do not understand all this.\" Lord Brahmä had considered Lord Kåñëa an ordinary cowherd boy and had treated Him as such. After accepting Brahmä's prayers, Kåñëa continued to play as a cowherd boy and thus did not answer the four-headed Brahmä. Rather, Kåñëa was more interested in rejoining His cowherd boyfriends for the picnic lunch on the bank of the Yamunä River."
