    "translation": "My dear Lord, it is said that when the three planetary systems are merged into the water at the time of dissolution, Your plenary portion, Näräyaëa, lies down on the water, gradually a lotus flower grows from His navel, and Brahmä takes birth upon that lotus flower. Certainly, these words are not false. Thus am I not born from You?",

            "content": "Although every living being is a child of God, Lord Brahmä here makes a special claim because he takes birth on a lotus flower that emanates from the navel of Näräyaëa, the Personality of Godhead. Ultimately, all living beings are equally expansions of the transcendental body of the Supreme Lord. But Brahmä has an intimate relationship with the Lord because of the activities of universal creation, and so he uses the prefix vi in the word vinirgata to beg the Lord's special mercy. Lord Brahmä is called aja because he is not born from any mother but rather emanates directly from the body of the Lord. As Çréla Prabhupäda states in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \"It is naturally concluded that the mother of Brahmä is Näräyaëa.\" On these grounds, Lord Brahmä is requesting special forgiveness for his offenses."
