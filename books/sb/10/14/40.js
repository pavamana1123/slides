Lord Kåñëa expertly suppressed the demoniac population of the earth, which became unbearable with the advent of demoniac politicians like Kaàsa, Jaräsandha and Çiçupäla. Similarly, in modern society there are many so-called God-fearing people who are actually attracted to demoniac existence. Such persons become enlivened with the setting of the sun and go out in the darkness to enjoy life in restaurants, nightclubs, discotheques, hotels and so on, which are all simply meant for illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. Then there are those who openly defy God and His laws, declaring themselves atheists and demons. Both the covert and the overt enemies of the Lord constitute an unholy burden for the earth, and Lord Kåñëa descends to expertly remove this burden."

            "content": "Here Lord Brahmä indirectly states that Lord Kåñëa should remove Brahmä's own subtle atheism, which had led him to try to exert illusory power over Lord Kåñëa. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Brahmä, in his shame, felt himself to be like a brahma-räkñasa from Satyaloka who had come to the earth to disturb Lord Kåñëa and His intimate friends and calves. Brahmä is lamenting that although Lord Kåñëa is most exalted, the Lord of all lords, because He had appeared before Brahmä in such a simple and innocent feature—decorated with a stick, a conchshell, ornaments, red clay, a peacock feather and so on, and sporting with His cowherd boyfriends—Brahmä dared to challenge Him. Concerning Brahmä's prayers, of which this verse is the conclusion, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura states, \"May these prayers of Brahmä, which take away all doubts and broadcast all the definitive conclusions of devotional service, become the expert craftsmanship of the foundation of my consciousness.\""
