A conditioned soul—even one so great as Brahmä, who manages the affairs of the entire universe—cannot compare to the Personality of Godhead, for He can produce numberless universes simply by the spiritual rays emanating from the pores of His body. Material scientists should take lessons from the utterances of Çré Brahmä regarding our insignificance in comparison with God. In these prayers of Brahmä there is much to learn for those who are falsely puffed up by the accumulation of power.\""

He is certainly the supreme teacher of this universe, in charge of the production of material nature, consisting of the complete material energy, false ego, sky, air, fire, water and earth. Such a universe may be gigantic, but it can be measured, just as we measure our body as seven spans. Generally, everyone's personal bodily measurement is calculated to be seven spans of his hand. This particular universe may appear to be a very gigantic body, but it is nothing but the measurement of seven spans for Lord Brahmä.\""

Just as innumerable atomic infinitesimal fragments pass through the holes of a screened window, so millions and trillions of universes in their seedling form are coming out from the bodily pores of Mahä-Viñëu, and that Mahä-Viñëu is but a part of the plenary expansion of Kåñëa. Under these circumstances, although Lord Brahmä is the supreme creature within this universe, what is his importance in the presence of Lord Kåñëa?"
