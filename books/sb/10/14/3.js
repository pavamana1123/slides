    "translation": "Those who, even while remaining situated in their established social positions, throw away the process of speculative knowledge and with their body, words and mind offer all respects to descriptions of Your personality and activities, dedicating their lives to these narrations, which are vibrated by You personally and by Your pure devotees, certainly conquer Your Lordship, although You are otherwise unconquerable by anyone within the three worlds.",

The word jévanti indicates that a devotee who always hears about Lord Kåñëa will go back home, back to Godhead, even if he can do nothing except maintain his existence and hear topics concerning the Lord."

In reference to devotees, through their body, words and mind they are able to conquer Lord Kåñëa. Thus becoming perfect in Kåñëa consciousness, they can touch His lotus feet with their hands, call Him to come with their words, and attain His direct audience within their mind simply by thinking about Him."

Despite all their endeavors, the ultimate truth remains beyond their reach."

Lord Kåñëa's body is conquered because He always remains by the side of His pure devotees; Lord Kåñëa's words are conquered because He always chants the glories of His devotees; and Lord Kåñëa's mind is conquered because He always thinks about His loving devotees."

One should engage his body by touching the ground with his hands and head while offering obeisances to the topics of the Lord; one should engage his words by praising transcendental literatures such as Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, as well as the devotees who are preaching such literatures; and one should engage his mind by feeling great reverence and pleasure while hearing the transcendental topics of the Lord. In this way, a sincere devotee who has acquired even a small amount of transcendental knowledge about Lord Kåñëa can conquer Him and thus go back home, back to Godhead, for eternal life at the Lord's side."
