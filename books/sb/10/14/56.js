Lord Kåñëa is the original identity, from whom all other identities emanate. He is the supreme energetic, from whom all categories and dimensions of energy become manifest. Thus, our personal bodies, self, family, friends, nation, planet, universe and so on are all manifestations of the Supreme Lord, who expands Himself through His personal potencies. Lord Kåñëa is certainly the supreme object of our love and attraction, and other objects, such as body, family and home, should be secondary objects of our affection. Moreover, a close analytic study of the actual situation will reveal that even the secondary objects of love are also manifestations of Lord Kåñëa. The conclusion is that Lord Kåñëa is our only friend and object of love."

            "content": "In his Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda comments on this verse as follows: \"Without being an expansion of Kåñëa, nothing can be attractive. Whatever is attractive within the cosmic manifestation is due to Kåñëa. Kåñëa is therefore the reservoir of all pleasure. The active principle of everything is Kåñëa, and highly elevated transcendentalists see everything in connection with Him. In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is stated that a mahä-bhägavata, a highly advanced devotee, sees Kåñëa as the active principle in all movable and immovable living entities. Therefore he sees everything within this cosmic manifestation in relation to Kåñëa.\""
