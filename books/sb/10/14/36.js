However, all these activities are intensely engaged in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa. The residents of Våndävana perform all activities in pure Kåñëa consciousness and thus exist on the most exalted platform of liberated life. Otherwise, the same activities performed without Kåñëa consciousness constitute ordinary bondage to the material world."

            "type": "normal",
            "content": "Thus, one should not misunderstand the exalted position of the residents of Våndävana, nor should one consider oneself highly religious simply because one performs ordinary domestic affairs very enthusiastically, but without Kåñëa consciousness. By focusing our passionate attachment on our family and society, we are completely deviated from the progressive path of Kåñëa consciousness. Conversely, if we engage our family in the loving service of the Lord, our endeavors to maintain our family become part and parcel of our progressive spiritual duties."

            "content": "In conclusion, by studying the extraordinary status of the residents of Våndävana, we can see that the essential quality of their lives is pure Kåñëa consciousness—the rendering of loving service to the Lord without a trace of material desire or mental speculation. Such loving service to the original Personality of Godhead immediately creates the atmosphere of Çré Våndävana-dhäma, the kingdom of God."
