    "translation": "For those who have accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Muräri, the enemy of the Mura demon, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf's hoof-print. Their goal is paraà padam, Vaikuëöha, the place where there are no material miseries, not the place where there is danger at every step.",

Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet are described as pallava, flower buds, because they are most tender and of a pinkish hue. According to Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, the word pallava also indicates that Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet are just like desire trees, which can fulfill all the desires of the Lord's pure devotees. Even exalted devotees like Çré Närada, who are themselves the great shelter for the conditioned souls in this universe, personally take shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Çré Kåñëa. Thus it is natural that when Lord Kåñëa manifested Himself as all the young boys and calves of Våndävana, their parents were more attracted to them than previously. Lord Kåñëa is the reservoir of all pleasure and, being all-attractive, the ultimate object of everyone's love."
