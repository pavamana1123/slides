Brahmä had tried to test Lord Kåñëa to see if He was really the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing as a cowherd boy. Brahmä stole all the other boys and their cows from the pasturing grounds, but when he returned to the pastures he saw that all the boys and cows were still there, for Lord Kåñëa had created them all again. When Brahmä saw this mystic power of Lord Kåñëa, he admitted defeat and offered prayers to the Lord, addressing Him as the proprietor and seer of everything in the creation and as the Supersoul who is within each and every living entity and is dear to all. Lord Kåñëa is Näräyaëa, the father of Brahmä, because Lord Kåñëa's plenary expansion Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, after placing Himself on the Garbha Ocean, created Brahmä from His own body. Mahä-Viñëu in the Causal Ocean and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, the Supersoul in everyone's heart, are also transcendental expansions of the Supreme Truth.\""

The essence is that although Lord Brahmä was born from Lord Näräyaëa, Brahmä now understands that Näräyaëa is Himself a mere expansion of the original Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa."
