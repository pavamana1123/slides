    "translation": "Lord Brahmä said: My dear Lord, You are the only worshipable Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore I offer my humble obeisances and prayers just to please You. O son of the king of the cowherds, Your transcendental body is dark blue like a new cloud, Your garment is brilliant like lightning, and the beauty of Your face is enhanced by Your guïjä earrings and the peacock feather on Your head. Wearing garlands of various forest flowers and leaves, and equipped with a herding stick, a buffalo horn and a flute, You stand beautifully with a morsel of food in Your hand.",

But by a slight exhibition of Kåñëa's own mystic potency, Brahmä himself was completely bewildered, and now with great humility and devotion he offers his humble obeisances and prayers unto the Lord."

            "content": "The word kavala in this verse refers to a morsel of rice mixed with yogurt that Kåñëa held in His left hand. According to Sanätana Gosvämé, the Lord held a cowherding stick and a buffalo horn pressed under His left arm, and His flute was placed under His belt. Beautiful young Kåñëa, decorated with multicolored forest minerals, exhibited opulences far greater than those of Vaikuëöha. Although Brahmä had seen innumerable four-armed forms of the Lord, he now surrendered unto the lotus feet of the two-armed form of Kåñëa, who appeared as the son of Nanda Mahäräja. Brahmä offered his prayers to that form."
