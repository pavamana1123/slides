            "content": "Lord Brahmä here refers to his experience at the dawn of cosmic creation. As described in the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Lord Brahmä took birth on the seat of a giant lotus whose stem emanated from the navel of Näräyaëa. Brahmä was bewildered as to his whereabouts, function and identity, and therefore he tried to trace out the source of the lotus stem, searching for clear information. Unable to find the Personality of Godhead, he returned to his seat and engaged in severe austerities, having been ordered to do so by the transcendental voice of the Lord, who could be heard but not seen. After long meditation, Brahmä saw the Lord but then again lost sight of Him. Thus Brahmä concludes that the transcendental body of the Personality of Godhead is not material but rather an eternal, spiritual form endowed with inconceivable mystic potencies. In other words, Lord Brahmä should not have challenged the Personality of Godhead, the Lord of all mystic power."
