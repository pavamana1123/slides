Sometimes the boys would jump around like the monkeys in Lord Rämacandra's army and then enact the building of the bridge to Çré Laìkä by constructing play bridges in lakes or ponds. Sometimes the boys would imitate the pastime of churning the ocean of milk, and sometimes they would play catch with balls. We can find full pleasure in the spiritual world, with the simple condition that everything be performed in pure love of Godhead, Kåñëa consciousness."
