Although my mind is completely withdrawn from material affairs, I cannot understand Your personal form. How, then, could I possibly understand the happiness You experience within Yourself?",

That is Your transcendental quality: You are very affectionate toward Your devotees. But in spite of Your great affection for me, I cannot estimate the potency of Your bodily activities. It is to be understood that when I, Lord Brahmä, the supreme personality of this universe, cannot estimate the childlike body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then what to speak of others? And if I cannot estimate the spiritual potency of Your childlike body, then what can I understand about Your transcendental pastimes? Therefore, as it is said in the Bhagavad-gétä, anyone who can understand a little of the transcendental pastimes, appearance and disappearance of the Lord immediately becomes eligible to enter the kingdom of God after quitting the material body. This statement is confirmed in the Vedas, where it is stated. Simply by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can overcome the chain of repeated birth and death. I therefore recommend that people should not try to understand You by their speculative knowledge.\""

As stated by Brahmä himself in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38): aìgäni yasya sakalendriya-våttimanti. This verse indicates not only that the Lord can perform any bodily function with any of His limbs but also that He can see through the eyes of His Viñëu expansions or, indeed, through the eyes of any living entity, and similarly that He can hear through the ears of any Viñëu or jéva expansion. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out that although the Lord can perform any function with any one of His senses, in His transcendental pastimes as Çré Kåñëa He generally sees with His eyes, touches with His hands, hears with His ears and so on. Thus He behaves like the most beautiful and charming young cowherd boy."

            "content": "The Vedic knowledge expands from Lord Brahmä, who is described in the first verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam as ädi-kavi, the primeval Vedic scholar. Yet Brahmä could not understand the transcendental body of Lord Kåñëa, because it is beyond the reach of ordinary Vedic knowledge. Among all the transcendental forms of the Lord, the two-armed form of Govinda-Kåñëa—is original and supreme. Thus Lord Govinda's pastimes of stealing butter, drinking the gopés' breast-milk, tending the calves, playing His flute and playing childhood sports are extraordinary even in comparison with the activities of the Lord's Viñëu expansions."
