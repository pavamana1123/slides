At that time, Çukadeva Gosvämé replied that everyone's ätmä, or soul, is very, very dear, especially to all living entities who have accepted material bodies. However, that ätmä, the spirit soul, is part and parcel of Kåñëa. For this reason, Kåñëa is very dear to every living entity. Everyone's body is very dear to oneself, and one wants to protect the body by all means because within the body the soul is living. Due to the intimate relationship between the soul and the body, the body is important and dear to everyone. Similarly, the soul, being part and parcel of Kåñëa, the Supreme Lord, is very, very dear to all living entities. Unfortunately, the soul forgets his constitutional position and thinks he is only the body (dehätma-buddhi). Thus the soul is subjected to the rules and regulations of material nature. When a living entity, by his intelligence, reawakens his attraction for Kåñëa, he can understand that he is not the body but part and parcel of Kåñëa. Thus filled with knowledge, he no longer labors under attachment to the body and everything related to the body (janasya moho 'yam ahaà mameti  states,"
