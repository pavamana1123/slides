You are the embodiment of all benedictions, which You bestow upon these residents of the cowherd community of Våndävana. You have already arranged to give Yourself to Pütanä and her family members in exchange for her disguising herself as a devotee. So what is left for You to give these devotees of Våndävana, whose homes, wealth, friends, dear relations, bodies, children and very lives and hearts are all dedicated only to You?",
