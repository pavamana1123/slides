To test Your power I tried to extend my illusory potency to cover You, the unlimited and primeval Supersoul, who bewilder even the masters of illusion. What am I compared to You?

Indeed, if one of the small sparks were to try to burn the original fire, the attempt would be simply ludicrous. Similarly, even the creator of the entire universe, Lord Brahmä, is an insignificant spark of the potency of God, and therefore Brahmä's attempt to bewilder the Supreme Lord was certainly ludicrous."

If Lord Kåñëa does not mercifully punish His devotees when they act improperly, their foolishness will simply increase and gradually completely overwhelm their devotional sentiments. Therefore Lord Kåñëa kindly disciplines His devotees and maintains them on the progressive path back home, back to Godhead."
