            "content": "It is clearly stated here that the entire universe is bewildered. Thus even great demigods like Indra and Brahmä are not exempt from the principle of forgetfulness. Since Lord Kåñëa exercised His internal illusory potency over His cowherd boyfriends and calves, it is not at all astonishing that for one year they could not remember their position. Indeed, by the Lord's external illusory potency the conditioned souls forget their existence not only for one year but for many billions and billions of years as they transmigrate throughout the kingdom of ignorance called the material world."
