    "translation": "Have You not shown me today that both You Yourself and everything within this creation are manifestations of Your inconceivable potency? First You appeared alone, and then You manifested Yourself as all of Våndävana's calves and cowherd boys, Your friends. Next You appeared as an equal number of four-handed Viñëu forms, who were worshiped by all living beings, including me, and after that You appeared as an equal number of complete universes. Finally, You have now returned to Your unlimited form as the Supreme Absolute Truth, one without a second.",

Thus everything is ultimately part and parcel of the Lord's spiritual existence. By Lord Kåñëa's causeless mercy, Lord Brahmä personally experienced that all existence, being the potency of God, is nondifferent from Him."
