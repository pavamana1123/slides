    "translation": "Lord Kåñëa's transcendental body was decorated with peacock feathers and flowers and painted with forest minerals, and His bamboo flute loudly and festively resounded. As He called out to His calves by name, His cowherd boyfriends purified the whole world by chanting His glories. Thus Lord Kåñëa entered the cow pasture of His father, Nanda Mahäräja, and the sight of His beauty at once produced a great festival for the eyes of all the cowherd women.",

Kåñëa's cowherd boyfriends were so proud of Kåñëa's wonderful activities that while entering the village they all sang His glories."
