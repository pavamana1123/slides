A newborn infant cannot ordinarily kill a powerful witch, and one would hardly think that a one-year-old baby could kill a demon who has kidnapped him and carried him up into the sky. But Kåñëa did all of these wonderful things, and the cowherd men were enhancing their love for Him by remembering and discussing His activities."
