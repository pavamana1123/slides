    "translation": "Indra became angry when his sacrifice was disrupted, and thus he caused rain and hail to fall on Gokula, accompanied by lightning and powerful winds, all of which brought great suffering to the cowherds, animals and women there. When Lord Kåñëa, who is by nature always compassionate, saw the condition of those who had only Him as their shelter, He smiled broadly and lifted Govardhana Hill with one hand, just as a small child picks up a mushroom to play with it. Holding up the hill, He protected the cowherd community. May He, Govinda, the Lord of the cows and the destroyer of Indra's false pride, be pleased with us.",

            "content": "It is apparent from this and the previous verses in this chapter that Lord Kåñëa's lifting of Govardhana Hill made quite an impression on the simple cowherd men of Våndävana, and they repeatedly remembered this feat. Certainly anyone who soberly and objectively considers the activities of young Kåñëa will surrender to Him and become His eternal devotee in loving devotional service. That is the rational conclusion one should come to after reading this chapter."
