Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura adds that the residents of Våndävana honored Nanda and Kåñëa with loving offerings of jewels and gold coins. Apparently, Lord Kåñëa was playing in the forest when this conversation took place, so when He returned home the residents of Våndävana encouraged Him by decorating Him with beautiful yellow garments, necklaces, armlets, earrings and crowns, and by shouting, \"All glories, all glories to the jewel of Våndävana!\""
