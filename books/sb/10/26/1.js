Thus they thought, 'Now we have directly seen child Kåñëa lift Govardhana Hill, and we remember how He killed Pütanä and other demons, extinguished the forest fire, and so on. At the time, we thought that these extraordinary acts occurred because of a benediction from the brähmaëas or because of Nanda Mahäräja's great fortune, or that perhaps this boy had achieved the mercy of Lord Näräyaëa and was thus empowered by Him."
