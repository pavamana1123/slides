Their attitude toward Him was not particularly theistic, because they were unsure whether He was God or not. But He attracted all their love precisely because as God He is the all-attractive person, the supreme object of our love."

            "content": "The cowherd men also asked, \"How is it that young Kåñëa feels such constant love for us?\" In fact the Supreme Lord loves all living beings, who are eternally His children. At the end of the Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëa dramatically declares His affection for Arjuna and urges Arjuna to reciprocate that love by surrendering to Him. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, in His prayers to Lord Kåñëa, states, etädåçé tava kåpä bhagavan mamäpi durdaivam édåçam ihäjani nänurägaù: \"My Lord, You are so merciful toward Me, but I am so unfortunate that love for You has not awakened within Me.\" (Çikñäñöaka 2) In this statement Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu also uses the word anuräga. Our misfortune is that we cannot reciprocate the anuräga, or loving affection, that the Lord feels for us. Although we are infinitesimal and insignificant and the Lord is infinitely attractive, somehow we do not give Him our love. We must accept responsibility for this foolish decision, since to surrender to God or not is the essential expression of our free will."

The intricacies of Kåñëa consciousness are so wonderful that even Kåñëa's eternal associates, the residents of Våndävana, are astonished by them, as shown by these verses."
