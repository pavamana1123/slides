The men approached Nanda Mahäräja and told him that after seeing how Kåñëa, a boy only seven years old, had lifted a mountain, and how He had previously killed the demoness Pütanä and generated extreme attraction in the hearts of everyone in Våndävana, the men had become doubtful and bewildered about how Çré Kåñëa could possibly have taken birth in the unsuitable environment of a cowherd community. Nanda replied by relating to them what Garga Muni had told him about Çré Kåñëa."

Because He descended as the son of Vasudeva, one of His many names is Väsudeva, and He has innumerable other names indicating His many qualities and activities."

In a previous age He had provided protection for the saintly brähmaëas when they were harassed by low-class dacoits and there was no proper ruler in society. As the demons in the higher planets can never defeat the demigods who have Lord Viñëu on their side, no enemy can ever defeat those who love Kåñëa. In His affinity for His devotees and in His opulence and power, Kåñëa is just like Lord Näräyaëa Himself."
