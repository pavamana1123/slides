Then, with Lord Balaräma, Kåñëa approached them and said how unhappy He was that He and they had been unable to enjoy the mutual satisfaction of parents and children who live together. Then He stated, \"Even in a lifetime of one hundred years, no son can ever repay the debt he owes his parents, from whom he receives his very body. Any capable son who fails to support his parents will be forced, in the hereafter, to eat his own flesh. Indeed, any person who does not maintain and nourish those under his care-children, wife, spiritual masters, brähmaëas, elderly parents and so on-is simply a living corpse. It was out of fear of Kaàsa that We could not serve you, so now please forgive Us.\" Vasudeva and Devaké, overcome with emotion upon hearing these words of Çré Kåñëa's, embraced their two sons and in ecstasy shed a torrent of tears."

Protected by the mighty arms of Kåñëa and Balaräma, the Yädavas began to enjoy supreme bliss."

Kåñëa then said to Nanda, \"Dear Father, please return to Vraja. Knowing how much you and Our other relatives are suffering in separation from Us, Balaräma and I will come to see you as soon as We have satisfied your friends here in Mathurä.\" Kåñëa then worshiped Nanda with various offerings, and Nanda felt overwhelmed with love for his sons. After tearfully embracing Kåñëa and Balaräma, he took the cowherd men and departed for Vraja. Next Vasudeva had his priests perform his sons' ritual of second birth, brahminical initiation. Kåñëa and Balaräma then went to Garga Muni to take the vow of brahmacarya, celibacy. Afterward, Kåñëa and Balaräma, though omniscient, desired to reside at the school of a spiritual master, and thus They went to live with Sändépani Muni at Avantépura."

Sändépani Muni, pleased by Their service, imparted to Them detailed knowledge of all the Vedas, together with their six corollaries and the Upaniñads. Kåñëa and Balaräma needed to hear each subject explained only once to assimilate it completely, and thus in sixty-four days They learned the sixty-four traditional arts."

Kåñëa asked the ocean to return His spiritual master's son, and the lord of the ocean replied that a demon dwelling within the ocean named Päïcajana had taken the boy away. Hearing this, Çré Kåñëa entered the ocean, killed that demon and took the shell that had grown from his body. But when Kåñëa did not find His guru's son within the demon's belly, He went to the planet of Yamaräja, the lord of death. Yamaräja came forward when he heard Kåñëa blow the Päïcajanya conchshell and devotedly worshiped Him. Lord Kåñëa then asked Yamaräja for Sändépani Muni's son, and Yamaräja immediately gave him to the two Lords."
