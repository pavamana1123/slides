Kåñëa was only eleven years old when He killed Kaàsa, according to Uddhava's words: ekädaça-samäs tatra güòhärciù sa-balo 'vasat. 'Like a covered flame, Lord Kåñëa remained there incognito with Balaräma for eleven years'  And since Kåñëa and Balaräma never took brahminical initiation in Vraja-bhümi, it was at the time (of Their going to Mathurä) that Their kaiçora stage began rather than ended."

The period from then to the age of six years and eight months, during which He lived in Våndävana, constitutes His paugaëòa stage. And the period from the age of six years and eight months through His tenth year, during which time He lived in Nandéçvara [Nandagräma], constitutes His kaiçora stage. Then, at the age of ten years and seven months, on the eleventh lunar day of the dark fortnight of the month of Caitra, He went to Mathurä, and on the fourteenth day thereafter He killed Kaàsa. Thus He completed His kaiçora period at age ten, and He eternally remains at that age. In other words, we should understand that from this point on the Lord remains forever a kiçora.\""
