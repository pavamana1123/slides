Rather, the Lord wanted to enjoy with them the ecstatic love of vätsalya-rasa, the relationship between parents and children. As Çréla Prabhupäda often pointed out, although we normally think of God as the supreme father, in Kåñëa consciousness we can enter into the Lord's pastimes and play the part of His parents, thus intensifying our love for Him."

He further explains that jana may also be translated as \"parents,\" since jana is derived from the verb jan, which in the causative form (janayate) means \"to generate or to give birth to.\" In this sense of the word (as in janané or janakau), the term jana-mohiné indicates that the Lord was about to expand His internal illusory potency so that Vasudeva and Devaké would again love Him as their dear child."
