    "translation": "Lord Janärdana took the conchshell that had grown around the demon's body and went back to the chariot. Then He proceeded to Saàyamané, the beloved capital of Yamaräja, the lord of death. Upon arriving there with Lord Balaräma, He loudly blew His conchshell, and Yamaräja, who keeps the conditioned souls in check, came as soon as he heard the resounding vibration. Yamaräja elaborately worshiped the two Lords with great devotion, and then he addressed Lord Kåñëa, who lives in everyone's heart: \"O Supreme Lord Viñëu, what shall I do for You and Lord Balaräma, who are playing the part of ordinary humans?\"",

According to the äcäryas, Païcajana had become a demon in a way similar to that of Jaya and Vijaya. In other words, though appearing in the form of a demon, he was actually a devotee of the Lord. The Skanda Puräëa, Avanti-khaëòa, describes the wonderful things that happened when Lord Kåñëa sounded His conchshell:"
