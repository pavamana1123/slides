    "translation": "Jaräsandha looked at the two of Them and said: O Kåñëa, lowest of men! I do not wish to fight alone with You, since it would be a shame to fight with a mere boy. You fool who keep Yourself hidden, O murderer of Your relatives, go away! I will not fight with You.",

            "content": "Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has interpreted Jaräsandha's words as follows. Puruñädhama can be understood as puruñä adhamä yasmät, meaning \"Kåñëa, to whom all men are inferior.\" In other words, here Lord Kåñëa is being addressed as \"O Puruñottama, best of living beings.\" Similarly, the word guptena, \"hidden,\" indicates Lord Kåñëa's aspect of being in everyone's heart and invisible to material vision. The words tvayä manda can also be divided, according to Sanskrit grammar, as tvayä amanda. In this case Jaräsandha is indicating that Kåñëa is not foolish but rather most alert. The word bandhu was used by Jaräsandha in the sense of \"relative,\" since Lord Kåñëa killed His maternal uncle, Kaàsa. However, bandhu comes from the verb bandh, \"to bind,\" and therefore bandhu-han can be understood as \"one who destroys the bondage of ignorance.\" Similarly, the word yähi, \"please go,\" indicates that Lord Kåñëa should approach the living beings and bless them to become Kåñëa conscious."
