What might be added here, for the sake of the squeamish, is that Jaräsandha came to Mathurä with the clear intention of slaughtering every last man in the city, including Kåñëa and Balaräma. It is out of the causeless mercy of the Lord that He gives the conditioned souls a taste of their own medicine and thus helps them become more sensitive to the laws of nature and the existence of a Supreme Godhead. Ultimately, Kåñëa awarded Jaräsandha and others killed on the battlefield spiritual liberation. The Lord is strict, but He is not malicious. In fact, He is an ocean of mercy."
