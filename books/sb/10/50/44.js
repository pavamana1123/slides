Infuriated by their laughter, Gärgya set out for the south, thinking, 'May I have a son who will bring terror to the Yädavas.' He worshiped Lord Mahädeva, eating powdered iron, and after twelve years obtained his desired benediction. Elated, he returned home."

Kälayavana possessed the fury of Lord Çiva in his aspect as Mahäkäla. Once, Kälayavana asked Närada, 'Who are now the strongest kings on earth?' Närada replied that the Yadus were. Thus sent by Närada, Kälayavana appeared at Mathurä.\""
