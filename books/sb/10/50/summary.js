Upon hearing this account, King Jaräsandha became angry. He vowed to rid the earth of all the Yädavas, and he gathered an immense army to lay siege to Mathurä. When Çré Kåñëa saw Jaräsandha attacking, the Lord considered the reasons for His descent to this world and then decided to destroy Jaräsandha's army, which was a burden to the earth."

Seeing this, Lord Kåñëa addressed Lord Baladeva, \"My dear brother, Jaräsandha is now attacking Mathurä-puré, so please mount Your chariot and let Us go destroy the enemy's army.\" The two Lords took up Their weapons, mounted Their chariots and went forth from the city."

King Jaräsandha surrounded Kåñëa and Balaräma with his soldiers, chariots and so on, and the women of the city, having climbed up to the roofs of the palaces, became extremely unhappy because they could not see the Lords. Then Kåñëa twanged His bow and started to rain down a torrent of arrows upon the enemy soldiers. Soon Jaräsandha's unfathomable army had been annihilated."

Lord Kåñëa reasoned that Jaräsandha would assemble another army and return again to fight; this would facilitate Kåñëa's goal of removing the earth's burden. Released, Jaräsandha returned to Magadha and vowed to perform austerities with the aim of avenging his defeat. The other kings advised him that his defeat was only a reaction of his karma. Thus informed, King Jaräsandha withdrew to his kingdom with a heavy heart."

Then, as Jaräsandha prepared to attack for the eighteenth time, a warrior named Kälayavana, who had been searching for a worthy opponent, was sent by Närada Muni to fight the Yädavas. With thirty million soldiers Kälayavana laid siege to the Yädava capital. Lord Kåñëa looked upon this attack with concern, for He knew that with Jaräsandha's arrival imminent, there was a serious danger that the simultaneous attack of these two enemies might endanger the Yädavas. Therefore the Lord constructed a wonderful city within the sea as a safe haven for the Yädavas; then He brought them all there by His mystic power. This city was fully populated with members of all four social orders, and within it no one felt the pangs of thirst and hunger. The various demigods, headed by Indra, each offered as tribute to Lord Kåñëa the same opulences they had originally obtained from Him to establish their positions of authority."
