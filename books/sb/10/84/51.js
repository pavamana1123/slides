The Brähmaëa portion of the Vedic çruti specifies the complete step-by-step procedure of only a few prototype sacrifices, such as the Jyotiñöoma and Darça-pürëamäsa. These are called the präkåta, or original, yajïas; the details of other yajïas must be extrapolated from the patterns of these präkåta injunctions according to the strict rules of the Mémäàsä-çästra. Since other yajïas are thus known by derivation from the prototype sacrifices, they are called vaikåta, or \"changed.\""
