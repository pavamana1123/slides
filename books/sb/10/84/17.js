    "translation": "Indeed, the humanlike pastimes of the Almighty are simply a pretense! Effortlessly, He alone sends forth from His Self this variegated creation, maintains it and then swallows it up again, all without becoming entangled, just as the element earth takes on many names and forms in its various transformations.",

This mystic process of the Lord's self-expansion is incomprehensible to all but Himself, but the example of the substance earth and its manifold products bears enough resemblance to provide some idea. The same example is also presented in an often—cited passage of the Chändogya Upaniñad (6.1), väcärambhaëaà vikäro nämadheyaà måttikety eva satyam: \"Earth's transformations are merely verbal creations of the process of naming; the substance earth itself is alone real.\""

You simply pretend to be under higher control.\""
