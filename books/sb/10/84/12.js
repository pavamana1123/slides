    "translation": "Neither the demigods controlling fire, the sun, the moon and the stars nor those in charge of earth, water, ether, air, speech and mind actually remove the sins of their worshipers, who continue to see in terms of dualities. But wise sages destroy one's sins when respectfully served for even a few moments.",

Nonetheless, because he recognizes Lord Viñëu's supreme position, such a devotee is better situated than materialistic worshipers of the demigods, and he thus deserves a degree of respect."

A neophyte devotee may be free from the more obvious sins of violence against innocent creatures and against his own body and mind, but until he becomes very advanced on the devotional path, he must always contend with the subtler contaminations of false pride, disrespect toward respectable Vaiñëavas and lack of compassion for suffering creatures. The best remedy for these symptoms of immaturity is to hear from and honor pure Vaiñëavas and to assist them in working to deliver the fallen, conditioned souls."
