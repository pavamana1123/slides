Since Gändhäré and the other ladies named here were not even mentioned in the previous chapter as having been present, Äcärya Çrédhara concludes that they must have heard the queens' narrations only secondhand. Indeed, Draupadé would never have spoken so freely in the presence of Påthä and Gändhäré, her elders, or before the gopés, whose attitude toward the queens of Dvärakä was not particularly sympathetic. Even though the gopés joined in shedding tears, it was more because of their being reminded of Çré Kåñëa's pastimes than because of any loving affinity between them and the queens."

            "content": "We should remember, of course, that there is always perfect harmony on the spiritual platform. Apparent conflict between pure devotees is nothing like mundane envy and strife. The jealousy of the gopés was more show than substance, being exhibited by them as an ecstatic symptom of their overflowing love for Kåñëa. Çréla Çrédhara Svämipäda further analyzes the phrase sva-gopyaù as implying that these gopés were the queens' sva-svarüpa, the original prototypes of whom the queens were specific expansions."
