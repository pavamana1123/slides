    "translation": "One who identifies his self as the inert body composed of mucus, bile and air, who assumes his wife and family are permanently his own, who thinks an earthen image or the land of his birth is worshipable, or who sees a place of pilgrimage as merely the water there, but who never identifies himself with, feels kinship with, worships or even visits those who are wise in spiritual truth—such a person is no better than a cow or an ass.",

But most excellent is the Vaiñëava who has gained the special mercy of the Lord and broken free from the bondage of illusory attachments altogether."
