But Närada was still concerned that Vasudeva might create an awkward mood by treating Lord Kåñëa as a mere child in the presence of all the sages. Närada and the other sages felt obliged to maintain their attitude of reverence toward Lord Kåñëa, so how could they ignore Him and presume to answer Vasudeva themselves? To avoid this embarrassment, Närada took this opportunity to remind everyone present of Çré Kåñëa' s absolute supremacy."
