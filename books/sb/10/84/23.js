And those kings at Kurukñetra who were not devotees of Kåñëa could not recognize Him as time, the annihilator of everything. Devotees and nondevotees are both covered by Mäyä, but in different ways. For the materialists Mäyä is illusion, but for the Vaiñëavas she acts as Yogamäyä, the internal potency who covers their awareness of the Supreme Lord's majesty and engages them in His eternal pleasure pastimes."
