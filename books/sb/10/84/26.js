    "translation": "Today we have directly seen Your feet, the source of the holy Ganges, which washes away volumes of sins. Perfected yogés can at best meditate upon Your feet within their hearts. But only those who render You wholehearted devotional service and in this way vanquish the soul's covering—the material mind—attain You as their final destination. Therefore kindly show mercy to us, Your devotees.",

Explaining this verse, Çréla Çrédhara Svämé says, \"If the Lord might advise the sages that they need not concern themselves with devotional practices because they are already far advanced in spiritual knowledge and austerity, they hereby respectfully decline such a suggestion, pointing out that only those yogés who have destroyed their material mind and ego by surrendering to Kåñëa in pure devotional service can attain full perfection. They conclude by praying to the Lord that He favor them in the most merciful way by making them His devotees.\""
