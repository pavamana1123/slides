As maintainers, They glanced upon Their devotees, embracing them and protecting them by smiling. Their smiles resembled the mode of goodness, protecting all the desires of the devotees, and the glancing of Their eyes resembled the mode of passion. Actually, in this verse the word rajaù means not \"passion\" but \"affection.\" In the material world, rajo-guëa is passion, but in the spiritual world it is affection. In the material world, affection is contaminated by rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa, but in the çuddha-sattva the affection that maintains the devotees is transcendental."

            "content": "The word svakärthänäm refers to great desires. As mentioned in this verse, the glance of Lord Viñëu creates the desires of the devotees. A pure devotee, however, has no desires. Therefore Sanätana Gosvämé comments that because the desires of devotees whose attention is fixed on Kåñëa have already been fulfilled, the Lord's sidelong glances create variegated desires in relation to Kåñëa and devotional service. In the material world, desire is a product of rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa, but desire in the spiritual world gives rise to a variety of everlasting transcendental service. Thus the word svakärthänäm refers to eagerness to serve Kåñëa."
