Now I can see that You alone are manifesting Yourself in all varieties of difference. Although one, You are existing in the different forms of the calves and boys. Please briefly explain this to Me.\" Having thus been requested by Lord Baladeva, Kåñëa explained the whole situation, and Baladeva understood it.",

They are all You; You Yourself are playing as the calves and cows and boys. What is the mystery of this situation? Where have those other calves and cows and boys gone? And why are You expanding Yourself as the cows, calves and boys? Will You kindly tell Me what is the cause?\" At the request of Balaräma, Kåñëa briefly explained the whole situation: how the calves and boys were stolen by Brahmä and how He was concealing the incident by expanding Himself so that people would not know that the original cows, calves and boys were missing. Balaräma understood, therefore, that this was not mäyä but Kåñëa's opulence. Kåñëa has all opulences, and this was but another opulence of Kåñëa."

            "content": "\"At first,\" Lord Balaräma said, \"I thought that these boys and calves were a display of the power of great sages like Närada, but now I see that all these boys and calves are You.\" After inquiring from Kåñëa, Lord Balaräma understood that Kåñëa Himself had become many. That the Lord can do this is stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38). Advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam: although He is one, He can expand Himself in so many forms. According to the Vedic version, ekaà bahu syäm: He can expand Himself into many thousands and millions but still remain one. In that sense, everything is spiritual because everything is an expansion of Kåñëa; that is, everything is an expansion either of Kåñëa Himself or of His potency. Because the potency is nondifferent from the potent, the potency and the potent are one (çakti-çaktimatayor abhedaù). The Mäyävädés, however, say, cid-acit-samanvayaù: spirit and matter are one. This is a wrong conception. Spirit (cit) is different from matter (acit), as explained by Kåñëa Himself in Bhagavad-gétä :"

But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.\" Spirit and matter cannot be made one, for actually they are superior and inferior energies, yet the Mäyävädés, or Advaita-vädés, try to make them one. This is wrong. Although spirit and matter ultimately come from the same one source, they cannot be made one. For example, there are many things that come from our bodies, but although they come from the same source, they cannot be made one. We should be careful to note that although the supreme source is one, the emanations from this source should be separately regarded as inferior and superior. The difference between the Mäyäväda and Vaiñëava philosophies is that the Vaiñëava philosophy recognizes this fact. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu's philosophy, therefore, is called acintya-bhedäbheda—simultaneous oneness and difference. For example, fire and heat cannot be separated, for where there is fire there is heat and where there is heat there is fire. Nonetheless, although we cannot touch fire, heat we can tolerate. Therefore, although they are one, they are different."
