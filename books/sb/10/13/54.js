The followers of the Upaniñads, however, cannot understand the varieties manifested by Brahman. This proves that Brahman and Paramätmä can actually he understood only through devotion, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Çrémad-Bhägavatam: bhaktyäham ekayä grähyaù . To establish that Brahman indeed has transcendental form, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura gives various quotations from the çästras. In the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (3.8), the Supreme is described as äditya-varëaà tamasaù parastät, \"He whose self-manifest form is luminous like the sun and transcendental to the darkness of ignorance.\" Änanda-mätram ajaraà puräëam ekaà santaà bahudhä dåçyamänam: \"The Supreme is blissful, with no tinge of unhappiness. Although He is the oldest, He never ages, and although one, He is experienced in different forms.\" Sarve nityäù çäçvatäç ca dehäs tasya parätmanaù: \"All the forms of that Supreme Person are eternal.\" (Mahä-varäha Puräëa) The Supreme Person has a form, with hands and legs and other personal features, but His hands and legs are not material. Bhaktas know that the form of Kåñëa, or Brahman, is not at all material. Rather, Brahman has a transcendental form, and when one is absorbed in it, being fully developed in bhakti, one can understand Him (premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena (BS 5.38)). The Mäyävädés, however, cannot understand this transcendental form, for they think that it is material."

He is the combination of these three transcendental features, and He is the object of worship for the followers of the Upaniñads. Brahmä realized that all the different forms of cows, boys and calves transformed into Viñëu forms were not transformed by mysticism of the type that a yogé or demigod can display by specific powers invested in him. The cows, calves and boys transformed into viñëu-mürtis, or Viñëu forms, were not displays of viñëu-mäyä, or Viñëu energy, but were Viñëu Himself. The respective qualifications of Viñëu and viñëu-mäyä are just like those of fire and heat. In heat there is the qualification of fire, namely warmth; and yet heat is not fire. The manifestation of the Viñëu forms of the boys, cows and calves was not like the heat, but rather like the fire—they were all actually Viñëu. Factually, the qualification of Viñëu is full truth, full knowledge and full bliss. Another example may be given with material objects, which may be reflected in many, many forms. For example, the sun is reflected in many waterpots, but the reflections of the sun in many pots are not actually the sun. There is no actual heat and light from the sun in the pot, although it appears as the sun. But each and every one of the forms Kåñëa assumed was fully Viñëu."
