Brahmä was surprised. \"The original cowherd boys and cows,\" he thought, \"are still where I put them last year. So who is it that is now keeping company with Kåñëa exactly as before? Where have they come from?\" Brahmä was surprised that his mystic power had been neglected. Without touching the original cows and cowherd boys kept by Brahmä, Kåñëa had created another assembly of calves and boys, who were all expansions of viñëu-tattva. Thus Brahmä's mystic power was superseded."
