Otherwise, how could this wonderful change take place? \"This mäyä might be some räkñasé-mäyä,\" He thought, \"but how can räkñasé-mäyä have any influence upon Me? This is not possible. Therefore it must be the mäyä of Kåñëa.\" He thus concluded that the mystical change must have been caused by Kåñëa, whom Balaräma considered His worshipable Personality of Godhead. He thought, \"It was arranged by Kåñëa, and even I could not check its mystic power.\" Thus Balaräma understood that all these boys and calves were only expansions of Kåñëa."
