Therefore, because the boys were actually Kåñëa's expansions, the cowherd men were especially attracted to them. At first the cowherd men, who were on top of the hill, were angry, but because of Kåñëa the boys were extremely attractive, and therefore the cowherd men immediately came down from the hill with special affection."
