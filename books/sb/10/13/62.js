    "translation": "After seeing this, Lord Brahmä hastily got down from his swan carrier, fell down like a golden rod and touched the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa with the tips of the four crowns on his heads. Offering his obeisances, he bathed the feet of Kåñëa with the water of his tears of joy.",

When one falls down before a superior just like a stick, one's offering of obeisances is called daëòavat. Daëòa means \"stick,\" and vat means \"like.\" It is not that one should simply say, \"daëòavat.\" Rather, one must fall down. Thus Brahmä fell down, touching his foreheads to the lotus feet of Kåñëa, and his crying in ecstasy is to be regarded as an abhiñeka bathing ceremony of Kåñëa's lotus feet."

            "content": "He who appeared before Brahmä as a human child was in fact the Absolute Truth, Parabrahman (brahmeti paramätmeti bhagavän iti çabdyate ). The Supreme Lord is naräkåti; that is, He resembles a human being. It is not that He is four-armed (catur-bähu). Näräyaëa is catur-bähu, but the Supreme Person resembles a human being. This is also confirmed in the Bible, where it is said that man was made in the image of God."

Astonished, Lord Brahmä hastily got down from his swan carrier and let his body fall to the earth. Usually, the demigods never touch the ground, but Lord Brahmä, voluntarily giving up his prestige as a demigod, bowed down on the ground before Kåñëa. Although Brahmä has one head in each direction, he voluntarily brought all his heads to the ground and touched Kåñëa's feet with the tips of his four helmets. Although his intelligence works in every direction, he surrendered everything before the boy Kåñëa."

As soon as bhakti is present, everything is purified (sarvopädhi-vinirmuktam ). Therefore Brahmä's crying was a form of bhakty-anubhäva, a transformation of transcendental ecstatic love."
