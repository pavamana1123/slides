Kåñëa is Näräyaëa, and Näräyaëa is also Kåñëa, for Kåñëa is the original Näräyaëa. Brahmä himself addressed Kåñëa, näräyaëas tvaà na hi sarva-dehinäm: \"You are also Näräyaëa. Indeed, You are the original Näräyaëa.\" \nKäla, or the time factor, has many assistants, such as svabhäva, saàskära, käma, karma and guëa. Svabhäva, or one's own nature, is formed according to the association of the material qualities. Käraëaà guëa-saìgo 'sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu . All the activities of Kåñëa described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, beginning even with the pastimes concerning Pütanä, are transcendental. Therefore, by hearing and discussing Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa are subdued, so that only sattva-guëa remains. Then rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa cannot do us any harm."

If one associates with bhaktas, then one's svabhäva, or nature, will change. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is meant to give people good association so that this change may take place, and we actually see that by this method people all over the world are gradually becoming devotees."

Therefore we should always seek good association, the association of devotees. Then our life will be successful. A man is known by his company.
