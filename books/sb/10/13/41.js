Therefore when Brahmä saw Lord Kåñëa still playing with all the cows and calves, he began trying to reason about what was happening. \"What is this?\" he thought. \"Maybe I took those calves and cowherd boys away but now they have been taken from that cave. Is this what has happened? Has Kåñëa brought them back here?\" Then, however, Lord Brahmä saw that the calves and boys he had taken were still in the same mystic mäyä into which he had put them. Thus he concluded that the calves and cowherd boys now playing with Kåñëa were different from the ones in the cave. He could understand that although the original calves and boys were still in the cave where he had put them, Kåñëa had expanded Himself and so the present demonstration of calves and boys consisted of expansions of Kåñëa. They had the same features, the same mentality and the same intentions, but they were all Kåñëa."
