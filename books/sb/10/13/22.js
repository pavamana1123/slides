    "translation": "The mothers of the boys, upon hearing the sounds of the flutes and bugles being played by their sons, immediately rose from their household tasks, lifted their boys onto their laps, embraced them with both arms and began to feed them with their breast milk, which flowed forth because of extreme love specifically for Kåñëa. Actually Kåñëa is everything, but at that time, expressing extreme love and affection, they took special pleasure in feeding Kåñëa, the Parabrahman, and Kåñëa drank the milk from His respective mothers as if it were a nectarean beverage.",

Now, in order to please them, Kåñëa personally took the role of their sons and fulfilled their desire. They enhanced their special love for Kåñëa by embracing Him and feeding Him, and Kåñëa tasted their breast milk to be just like a nectarean beverage. While thus bewildering Brahmä, He enjoyed the special transcendental pleasure created by yogamäyä between all the other mothers and Himself."
