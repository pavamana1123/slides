Brahmä had considered himself absolute, thinking himself the only powerful deity, but now his pride was subdued, and he again became merely one of the demigods—an important demigod, of course, but a demigod nonetheless. Brahmä, therefore, cannot be compared to God—Kåñëa, or Näräyaëa. It is forbidden to compare Näräyaëa even to demigods like Brahmä and Çiva, what to speak of others."

Also, as mentioned in the Vedas, eko näräyaëa äsén na brahmä neçänaù: \"In the beginning of creation there was only the Supreme Personality, Näräyaëa, and there was no existence of Brahmä or Çiva.\" Therefore, one who at the end of his life remembers Näräyaëa attains the perfection of life (ante näräyaëa-småtiù )."
