    "translation": "Previously, from the very beginning, the gopés had motherly affection for Kåñëa. Indeed, their affection for Kåñëa exceeded even their affection for their own sons. In displaying their affection, they had thus distinguished between Kåñëa and their sons, but now that distinction disappeared.",

            "content": "The distinction between one's own son and another's son is not unnatural. Many elderly women have motherly affection for the sons of others. They observe distinctions, however, between those other sons and their own. But now the elderly gopés could not distinguish between their own sons and Kåñëa, for since their own sons had been taken by Brahmä, Kåñëa had expanded as their sons. Therefore, their extra affection for their sons, who were now Kåñëa Himself, was due to bewilderment resembling that of Brahmä. Previously, the mothers of Çrédämä, Sudämä, Subala and Kåñëa's other friends did not have the same affection for one another's sons, but now the gopés treated all the boys as their own. Çukadeva Gosvämé, therefore, wanted to explain this increment of affection in terms of Kåñëa's bewilderment of Brahmä, the gopés, the cows and everyone else."
