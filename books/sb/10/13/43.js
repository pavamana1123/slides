How has this happened?\" Brahmä could not grasp what was happening. Which boys were real, and which were not real? Brahmä was unable to come to any definite conclusion. He pondered the matter for a long while. \"How can there be two sets of calves and boys at the same time? Have the boys and calves here been created by Kåñëa, or has Kåñëa created the ones lying asleep? Or are both merely creations of Kåñëa?\" Brahmä thought about the subject in many different ways. \"After I go to the cave and see that the boys and calves are still there, does Kåñëa go take them away and put them here so that I come here and see them, and does Kåñëa then take them from here and put them there?\" Brahmä could not figure out how there could be two sets of calves and cowherd boys exactly alike. Although thinking and thinking, he could not understand at all."
