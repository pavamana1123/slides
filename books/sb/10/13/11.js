    "translation": "Kåñëa is yajïa-bhuk—that is, He eats only offerings of yajïa—but to exhibit His childhood pastimes, He now sat with His flute tucked between His waist and His tight cloth on His right side and with His horn bugle and cow-driving stick on His left. Holding in His hand a very nice preparation of yogurt and rice, with pieces of suitable fruit between His fingers, He sat like the whorl of a lotus flower, looking forward toward all His friends, personally joking with them and creating jubilant laughter among them as He ate. At that time, the denizens of heaven were watching, struck with wonder at how the Personality of Godhead, who eats only in yajïa, was now eating with His friends in the forest.",

Thus Kåñëa joked, \"Why have you come to disturb My brähmaëa friend Madhumaìgala? You want to kill a brähmaëa. This is not good.\" All the boys would laugh and enjoy, speaking such joking words while eating. Thus the inhabitants of the higher planets were astonished at how the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who eats only when yajïa is offered, was now eating like an ordinary child with His friends in the forest."
