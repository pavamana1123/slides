    "translation": "By His Väsudeva feature, Kåñëa simultaneously expanded Himself into the exact number of missing cowherd boys and calves, with their exact bodily features, their particular types of hands, legs and other limbs, their sticks, bugles and flutes, their lunch bags, their particular types of dress and ornaments placed in various ways, their names, ages and forms, and their special activities and characteristics. By expanding Himself in this way, beautiful Kåñëa proved the statement samagra-jagad viñëumayam: \"Lord Viñëu is all-pervading.\"",
