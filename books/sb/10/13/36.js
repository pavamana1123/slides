Balaräma was astonished to see all the residents of Våndävana so affectionate toward their own children, exactly as they had been for Kåñëa. Similarly, the cows had grown affectionate toward their calves—as much as toward Kåñëa. Balaräma was surprised to see the acts of yogamäyä. Therefore He inquired from Kåñëa, \"What is happening here? What is this mystery?\""
