    "translation": "All those personalities had four arms, holding conchshell, disc, mace and lotus flower in Their hands. They wore helmets on Their heads, earrings on Their ears and garlands of forest flowers around Their necks. On the upper portion of the right side of Their chests was the emblem of the goddess of fortune. Furthermore, They wore armlets on Their arms, the Kaustubha gem around Their necks, which were marked with three lines like a conchshell, and bracelets on Their wrists. With bangles on Their ankles, ornaments on Their feet, and sacred belts around Their waists, They all appeared very beautiful.",

However, these Viñëu forms appearing before Lord Brahmä also possessed the mark of Çrévatsa and the Kaustubha gem, which are special characteristics possessed only by the Supreme Lord Himself. This proves that all these boys and calves were in fact directly expansions of Viñëu, the Personality of Godhead, not merely His associates of Vaikuëöha. Viñëu Himself is included within Kåñëa. All the opulences of Viñëu are already present in Kåñëa, and consequently for Kåñëa to demonstrate so many Viñëu forms was actually not very astonishing."
