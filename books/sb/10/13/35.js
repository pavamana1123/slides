    "translation": "Because of an increase of affection, the cows had constant attachment even to those calves that were grown up and had stopped sucking milk from their mothers.

            "content": "The cows had younger calves who had started sucking milk from their mothers, and some of the cows had newly given birth, but now, because of love, the cows enthusiastically showed their affection for the older calves, which had left off milking. These calves were grown up, but still the mothers wanted to feed them. Therefore Balaräma was a little surprised, and He wanted to inquire from Kåñëa about the reason for their behavior. The mothers were actually more anxious to feed the older calves, although the new calves were present, because the older calves were expansions of Kåñëa. These surprising events were taking place by the manipulation of yogamäyä. There are two mäyäs working under the direction of Kåñëa-mahämäyä, the energy of the material world, and yogamäyä, the energy of the spiritual world. These uncommon events were taking place because of the influence of yogamäyä. From the very day on which Brahmä stole the calves and boys, yogamäyä acted in such a way that the residents of Våndävana, including even Lord Balaräma, could not understand how yogamäyä was working and causing such uncommon things to happen. But as yogamäyä gradually acted, Balaräma in particular was able to understand what was happening, and therefore He inquired from Kåñëa."
