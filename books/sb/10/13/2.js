    "translation": "Paramahaàsas, devotees who have accepted the essence of life, are attached to Kåñëa in the core of their hearts, and He is the aim of their lives. It is their nature to talk only of Kåñëa at every moment, as if such topics were newer and newer. They are attached to such topics, just as materialists are attached to topics of women and sex.",

            "content": "The word sära-bhåtäm means paramahaàsas. The haàsa, or swan, accepts milk from a mixture of milk and water and rejects the water. Similarly, the nature of persons who have taken to spiritual life and Kåñëa consciousness, understanding Kåñëa to be the life and soul of everyone, is that they cannot give up kåñëa-kathä, or topics about Kåñëa, at any moment. Such paramahaàsas always see Kåñëa within the core of the heart (santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti). Käma (desires), krodha (anger) and bhaya (fear) are always present in the material world, but in the spiritual, or transcendental, world one can use them for Kåñëa. Kämaà kåñëa-karmärpaëe. The desire of the paramahaàsas, therefore, is to act always for Kåñëa. Krodhaà bhakta-dveñi jane. They use anger against the nondevotees and transform bhaya, or fear, into fear of being deviated from Kåñëa consciousness. In this way, the life of a paramahaàsa devotee is used entirely for Kåñëa, just as the life of a person attached to the material world is used simply for women and money. What is day for the materialistic person is night for the spiritualist. What is very sweet for the materialist—namely women and money—is regarded as poison by the spiritualist."
