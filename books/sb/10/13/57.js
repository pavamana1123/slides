    "translation": "The Supreme Brahman is beyond mental speculation, He is self-manifest, existing in His own bliss, and He is beyond the material energy. He is known by the crest jewels of the Vedas by refutation of irrelevant knowledge. Thus in relation to that Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, whose glory had been shown by the manifestation of all the four-armed forms of Viñëu, Lord Brahmä, the lord of Sarasvaté, was mystified. \"What is this?\" he thought, and then he was not even able to see. Lord Kåñëa, understanding Brahmä's position, then at once removed the curtain of His yogamäyä.",

Lord Kåñëa, understanding Brahmä's position, then removed that yogamäyä covering. In this verse, Brahmä is referred to as ireça. Irä means Sarasvaté, the goddess of learning, and Ireça is her husband, Lord Brahmä. Brahmä, therefore, is most intelligent. But even Brahmä, the lord of Sarasvaté, was bewildered about Kåñëa. Although he tried, he could not understand Lord Kåñëa. In the beginning the boys, the calves and Kåñëa Himself had been covered by yogamäyä, which later displayed the second set of calves and boys, who were Kåñëa's expansions, and which then displayed so many four-armed forms. Now, seeing Brahmä's bewilderment, Lord Kåñëa caused the disappearance of that yogamäyä. One may think that the mäyä taken away by Lord Kåñëa was mahämäyä, but Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments that it was yogamäyä, the potency by which Kåñëa is sometimes manifest and sometimes not manifest. The potency which covers the actual reality and displays something unreal is mahämäyä, but the potency by which the Absolute Truth is sometimes manifest and sometimes not is yogamäyä. Therefore, in this verse the word ajä refers to yogamäyä."

The difference between Vaiñëavas and Mäyävädés is that Mäyävädés say that this mäyä is one, whereas Vaiñëavas recognize its varieties. There is unity in variety. For example, in one tree, there are varieties of leaves, fruits and flowers. Varieties of energy are required for performing the varieties of activity within the creation. To give another example, in a machine all the parts may be iron, but the machine includes varied activities. Although the whole machine is iron, one part works in one way, and other parts work in other ways. One who does not know how the machine is working may say that it is all iron; nonetheless, in spite of its being iron, the machine has different elements, all working differently to accomplish the purpose for which the machine was made. One wheel runs this way, another wheel runs that way, functioning naturally in such a way that the work of the machine goes on. Consequently we give different names to the different parts of the machine, saying, \"This is a wheel,\" \"This is a screw,\" \"This is a spindle,\" \"This is the lubrication,\" and so on. Similarly, as explained in the Vedas,"

Thus yogamäyä and mahämäyä are among the varied individual parts of the same one potency, and all of these individual potencies work in their own varied ways. The saàvit, sandhiné and ählädiné potencies—Kåñëa's potency for existence, His potency for knowledge and His potency for pleasure—are distinct from yogamäyä. Each is an individual potency. The ählädiné potency is Rädhäräëé. As Svarüpa Dämodara Gosvämé has explained, rädhä kåñëa-praëaya-vikåtir hlädiné çaktir asmät . The ählädiné-çakti is manifested as Rädhäräëé, but Kåñëa and Rädhäräëé are the same, although one is potent and the other is potency."

With one's limited senses, one cannot argue about that which is inconceivable. Therefore the inconceivable is called acintya, that which is beyond cintya, our thoughts and arguments. Acintya refers to that which we cannot contemplate but have to accept. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has said that unless we accept acintya in the Supreme, we cannot accommodate the conception of God. This must be understood. Therefore we say that the words of çästra should be taken as they are, without change, since they are beyond our arguments. Acintyäù khalu ye bhävä na täàs tarkeëa yojayet: \"That which is acintya cannot be ascertained by argument.\" People generally argue, but our process is not to argue but to accept the Vedic knowledge as it is. When Kåñëa says, \"This is superior, and this is inferior,\" we accept what He says. It is not that we argue, \"Why is this superior and that inferior?\" If one argues, for him the knowledge is lost."

Rather, one must follow the avaroha-panthä, the process of descending knowledge. Therefore one must accept the paramparä system.
