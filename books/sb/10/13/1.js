Nityaà nava-naväya-mänam: even though advanced devotees hear continually about the Lord for years, they still feel that these topics are coming to them as newer and fresher. Therefore such devotees cannot give up hearing of the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa. premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti. The word santaù is used to refer to persons who have developed love for Kåñëa. Yaà çyämasundaram acintya-guëa-svarüpaà govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi (BS 5.38). Parékñit Mahäräja, therefore, is addressed as bhägavatottama, the best of devotees, because unless one is very much elevated in devotional service, one cannot feel ecstasy from hearing more and more and appreciate the topics as ever fresher and newer."
