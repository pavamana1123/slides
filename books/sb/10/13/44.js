Since Brahmä, the chief person within this universe, was so bewildered, what is to be said of so-called scientists and philosophers? Sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja. We should give up all our tiny efforts to defy the arrangement of Kåñëa. Instead, whatever arrangements He proposes, we should accept. This is always better, for this will make us happy. The more we try to defeat the arrangement of Kåñëa, the more we become implicated in Kåñëa's mäyä (daivé hy eñä guëa-mayé mama mäyä duratyayä). But one who has reached the point of surrendering to the instructions of Kåñëa (mäm eva ye prapadyante) is liberated, free from kåñëa-mäyä (mäyäm etäà taranti te ). The power of Kåñëa is just like a government that cannot be overcome. First of all there are laws, and then there is police power, and beyond that is military power. Therefore, what is the use of trying to overcome the power of the government? Similarly, what is the use of trying to challenge Kåñëa?"

If one gets even a little power of scientific knowledge, one tries to defy God, but actually no one is able to bewilder Kåñëa. When Brahmä, the chief person within the universe, tried to bewilder Kåñëa, he himself was bewildered and astonished. This is the position of the conditioned soul. Brahmä wanted to mystify Kåñëa, but he himself was mystified."

This was exhibited in Dvärakä when Kåñëa called for Brahmä. One day when Brahmä came to see Kåñëa at Dvärakä, the doorman, at Lord Kåñëa's request, asked, \"Which Brahmä are you?\" Later, when Brahmä inquired from Kåñëa whether this meant that there was more than one Brahmä, Kåñëa smiled and at once called for many Brahmäs from many universes. The four-headed Brahmä of this universe then saw innumerable other Brahmäs coming to see Kåñëa and offer their respects. Some of them had ten heads, some had twenty, some had a hundred and some had a million heads. Upon seeing this wonderful exhibition, the four-headed Brahmä became nervous and began to think of himself as no more than a mosquito in the midst of many elephants. Therefore, what can Brahmä do to bewilder Kåñëa?"
