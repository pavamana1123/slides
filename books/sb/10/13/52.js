No one can command Him, but He can command everyone. Sad-aiçvarya-pürëam. The Lord is full in six opulences. The yoga-siddhis, the perfections of yoga, such as the ability to become smaller than the smallest (aëimä-siddhi) or bigger than the biggest (mahimä-siddhi), are present in Lord Viñëu. Sad-aiçvaryaiù pürëo ya iha bhagavän . The word ajä means mäyä, or mystic power. Everything mysterious is in full existence in Viñëu."

All twenty-four of these elements are employed for the manifestation of this material world. The mahat-tattva is divided into different subtle categories, but originally it is called the mahat-tattva."
