Küjat-kokila-haàsa-särasa-gaëäkérëe mayüräkule. Våndävana forest is always filled with the chirping and cooing of birds like cuckoos (kokila), ducks (haàsa) and cranes (särasa), and it is also full of peacocks (mayüräkule). The same sounds and atmosphere still prevail in the area where our Kåñëa-Balaräma temple is situated. Everyone who visits this temple is pleased to hear the chirping of the birds as described here (küjat-kokila-haàsa-särasa)."
