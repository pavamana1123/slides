Repeatedly he fell and rose as he recalled the wonderful activities of the Lord. After repeating obeisances for a long time, Brahmä stood up and smeared his hands over his eyes. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments that the word locane indicates that with his two hands he wiped the two eyes on each of his four faces. Seeing the Lord before him, Brahmä began to offer prayers with great humility, respect and attention."
