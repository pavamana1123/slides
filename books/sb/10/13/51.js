Therefore the mahä-bhägavata, the topmost devotee, sees everyone as being engaged in the service of Kåñëa; only himself does he see as not engaged. We have to elevate ourselves from a lower position to a higher position, and the topmost position is that of direct service in Våndävana. But everyone is engaged in service. Denial of the service of the Lord is mäyä."
