            "content": "We actually do not die. At death, we are merely kept inert for some time, just as during sleep. At night we sleep, and all our activities stop, but as soon as we arise, our memory immediately returns, and we think, \"Oh, where am I? What do I have to do?\" This is called suptotthita-nyäya. Suppose we die. \"Die\" means that we become inert for some time and then again begin our activities. This takes place life after life, according to our karma, or activities, and svabhäva, or nature by association. Now, in the human life, if we prepare ourselves by beginning the activity of our spiritual life, we return to our real life and attain perfection. Otherwise, according to karma, svabhäva, prakåti and so on, our varieties of life and activity continue, and so also do our birth and death. As explained by Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura, mäyära vaçe, yäccha bhese', khäccha häbuòubu bhäi: \"My dear brothers, why are you being washed away by the waves of mäyä?\" One should come to the spiritual platform, and then one's activities will be permanent. Kåta-puëya-puïjäù: . The Kåñëa consciousness movement wants to stop koöi-janma, repeated birth and death. In one birth, one should rectify everything and come to permanent life. This is Kåñëa consciousness."
