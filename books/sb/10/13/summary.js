After killing Aghäsura, Kåñëa, along with His associates the cowherd boys, went for a picnic within the forest. The calves, being allured by green grasses, gradually went far away, and therefore Kåñëa's associates became a little agitated and wanted to bring back the calves. Kåñëa, however, encouraged the boys by saying, \"You take your tiffin without being agitated. I shall go find the calves.\" And thus the Lord departed. Then, just to examine the potency of Kåñëa, Lord Brahmä took away all the calves and cowherd boys and kept them in a secluded place."

Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, in order to please Lord Brahmä, as well as His own associates and their mothers, expanded Himself to become the calves and boys, exactly as they were before. In this way, He discovered another pastime. A special feature of this pastime was that the mothers of the cowherd boys thus became more attached to their respective sons, and the cows became more attached to their calves. After nearly a year, Baladeva observed that all the cowherd boys and calves were expansions of Kåñëa. Thus He inquired from Kåñëa and was informed of what had happened."

Then Kåñëa exhibited all the calves and cowherd boys as four-armed forms of Näräyaëa. Brahmä could then understand Kåñëa's potency, and he was astonished by the pastimes of Kåñëa, his worshipable Lord. Kåñëa, however, bestowed His causeless mercy upon Brahmä and released him from illusion. Thus Brahmä began to offer prayers to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
