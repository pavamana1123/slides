The Lord's knowledge is unlimited, and therefore one cannot touch where it ends, just as one cannot measure the ocean. What is the extent of our intelligence in comparison to the vast expanse of water in the ocean? On my passage to America, how insignificant the ship was, like a matchbox in the midst of the ocean. Kåñëa's intelligence resembles the ocean, for one cannot imagine how vast it is. The best course, therefore, is to surrender to Kåñëa. Don't try to measure Kåñëa."

            "content": "The word advayam, meaning \"one without a second,\" is also significant. Because Brahmä was overcast by Kåñëa's mäyä, he was thinking himself the Supreme. In the material world, everyone thinks, \"I am the best man in this world. I know everything.\" One thinks, \"Why should I read Bhagavad-gétä? I know everything. I have my own interpretation.\" Brahmä, however, was able to understand that the Supreme Personality is Kåñëa. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù (BS 5.1). Another of Kåñëa's names, therefore, is parameçvara."

Brahmä did not see Kåñëa as catur-bhuja, the opulent Näräyaëa; rather, he simply saw an innocent boy. Nonetheless, he could understand that although Kåñëa was not demonstrating His power, He was the same Supreme person. people generally do not appreciate someone unless he shows something wonderful, but here, although Kåñëa did not manifest anything wonderful, Brahmä could understand that the same wonderful person was present like an ordinary child, although He was the master of the whole creation. Thus Brahmä prayed, govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi: \"You are the original person, the cause of everything. I bow down to You.\" This was his realization. Tam ahaà bhajämi. This is what is wanted. Vedeñu durlabham: one cannot reach Kåñëa merely by Vedic knowledge. Adurlabham ätma-bhaktau: but when one becomes a devotee, then one can realize Him. Brahmä, therefore, became a devotee. In the beginning he was proud of being Brahmä, the lord of the universe, but now he understood, \"Here is the Lord of the universe. I am simply an insignificant agent. Govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi.\""

            "content": "Kåñëa was playing like a dramatic actor. Because Brahmä had some false prestige, thinking that he had some power, Kåñëa showed him his real position. A similar incident occurred when Brahmä went to see Kåñëa in Dvärakä. When Kåñëa's doorman informed Lord Kåñëa that Lord Brahmä had arrived, Kåñëa responded, \"Which Brahmä? Ask him which Brahmä.\" The doorman relayed this question, and Brahmä was astonished. \"Is there another Brahmä besides me?\" he thought. When the doorman informed Lord Kåñëa, \"It is four-headed Brahmä,\" Lord Kåñëa said, \"Oh, four-headed. Call others. Show him.\" This is Kåñëa's position. For Kåñëa the four-headed Brahmä is insignificant, to say nothing of \"four-headed scientists.\" Materialistic scientists think that although this planet earth is full of opulence, all others are vacant. Because they simply speculate, this is their scientific conclusion. But from the Bhägavatam we understand that the entire universe is full of living entities everywhere. Thus it is the folly of the scientists that although they do not know anything, they mislead people by presenting themselves as scientists, philosophers and men of knowledge."
