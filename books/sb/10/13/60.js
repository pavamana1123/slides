            "content": "The word vana means \"forest.\" We are afraid of the forest and do not wish to go there, but in Våndävana the forest animals are as good as demigods, for they have no envy. Even in this material world, in the forest the animals live together, and when they go to drink water they do not attack anyone. Envy develops because of sense gratification, but in Våndävana there is no sense gratification, for the only aim is Kåñëa's satisfaction. Even in this material world, the animals in Våndävana are not envious of the sädhus who live there. The sädhus keep cows and supply milk to the tigers, saying, \"Come here and take a little milk.\" Thus envy and malice are unknown in Våndävana. That is the difference between Våndävana and the ordinary world. We are horrified to hear the name of vana, the forest, but in Våndävana there is no such horror. Everyone there is happy by pleasing Kåñëa. Kåñëotkértana-gäna-nartana-parau. Whether a gosvämé or a tiger or other ferocious animal, everyone's business is the same—to please Kåñëa. Even the tigers are also devotees. This is the specific qualification of Våndävana. In Våndävana everyone is happy. The calf is happy, the cat is happy, the dog is happy, the man is happy—everyone. Everyone wants to serve Kåñëa in a different capacity, and thus there is no envy. One may sometimes think that the monkeys in Våndävana are envious, because they cause mischief and steal food, but in Våndävana we find that the monkeys are allowed to take butter, which Kåñëa Himself distributes. Kåñëa personally demonstrates that everyone has the right to live. This is Våndävana life. Why should I live and you die? No. That is material life. The inhabitants of Våndävana think, \"Whatever is given by Kåñëa, let us divide it as prasäda and eat.\" This mentality cannot appear all of a sudden, but it will gradually develop with Kåñëa consciousness; by sädhana, one can come to this platform."

            "content": "In the material world one may collect funds all over the world in order to distribute food freely, yet those to whom the food is given may not even feel appreciative. The value of Kåñëa consciousness, however, will gradually be very much appreciated. For instance, in an article about the temple of the Hare Kåñëa movement in Durban, South Africa, the Durban Post reported, \"All the devotees here are very active in the service of Lord Kåñëa, and the results are obvious to see: happiness, good health, peace of mind, and the development of all good qualities.\" This is the nature of Våndävana. Haräv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guëäù: without Kåñëa consciousness, happiness is impossible; one may struggle, but one cannot have happiness. We are therefore trying to give human society the opportunity for a life of happiness, good health, peace of mind and all good qualities through God consciousness."
