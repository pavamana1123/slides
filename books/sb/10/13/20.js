    "translation": "Now expanding Himself so as to appear as all the calves and cowherd boys, all of them as they were, and at the same time appear as their leader, Kåñëa entered Vrajabhümi, the land of His father, Nanda Mahäräja, just as He usually did while enjoying their company.",

            "content": "Kåñëa usually stayed in the forest and pasturing ground, taking care of the calves and cows with His associates the cowherd boys. Now that the original group had been taken away by Brahmä, Kåñëa Himself assumed the forms of every member of the group, without anyone's knowledge, even the knowledge of Baladeva, and continued the usual program. He was ordering His friends to do this and that, and He was controlling the calves and going into the forest to search for them when they went astray, allured by new grass, but these calves and boys were He Himself. This was Kåñëa's inconceivable potency. As explained by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, rädhä kåñëa-praëaya-vikåtir hlädiné çaktir asmät. Rädhä and Kåñëa are the same. Kåñëa, by expanding His pleasure potency, becomes Rädhäräëé. The same pleasure potency (änanda-cinmaya-rasa) was expanded by Kåñëa when He Himself became all the calves and boys and enjoyed transcendental bliss in Vrajabhümi. This was done by the yogamäyä potency and was inconceivable to persons under the potency of mahämäyä."
