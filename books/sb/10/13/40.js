    "translation": "When Lord Brahmä returned after a moment of time had passed (according to his own measurement), he saw that although by human measurement a complete year had passed, Lord Kåñëa, after all that time, was engaged just as before in playing with the boys and calves, who were His expansions.",

            "content": "Lord Brahmä had gone away for only a moment of his time, but when he returned, a year of human time had passed. On different planets, the calculation of time is different. To give an example, a man-made satellite may orbit the earth in an hour and twenty-five minutes and thus complete one full day, although a day ordinarily takes twenty-four hours for those living on earth. Therefore, what was but a moment for Brahmä was one year on earth. Kåñëa continued to expand Himself in so many forms for one year, but by the arrangement of yogamäyä no one could understand this but Balaräma."

            "content": "After one moment of Brahmä's calculation, Brahmä came back to see the fun caused by his stealing the boys and calves. But he was also afraid that he was playing with fire. Kåñëa was his master, and he had played mischief for fun by taking away Kåñëa's calves and boys. He was really anxious, so he did not stay away very long; he came back after a moment (of his calculation). When Brahmä returned, he saw that all the boys, calves and cows were playing with Kåñëa in the same way as when he had come upon them; by Kåñëa's display of yogamäyä, the same pastimes were going on without any change."

            "content": "On the day when Lord Brahmä had first come, Baladeva could not go with Kåñëa and the cowherd boys, for it was His birthday, and His mother had kept Him back for the proper ceremonial bath, called çäntika-snäna. Therefore Lord Baladeva was not taken by Brahmä at that time. Now, one year later, Brahmä returned, and because he returned on exactly the same day, Baladeva was again kept at home for His birthday. Therefore, although this verse mentions that Brahmä saw Kåñëa and all the cowherd boys, Baladeva is not mentioned. It was five or six days earlier that Baladeva had inquired from Kåñëa about the extraordinary affection of the cows and cowherd men, but now, when Brahmä returned, Brahmä saw all the calves and cowherd boys playing with Kåñëa as expansions of Kåñëa, but he did not see Baladeva. As in the previous year, Lord Baladeva did not go to the woods on the day Lord Brahmä appeared there."
