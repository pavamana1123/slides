    "translation": "O Mahäräja Parékñit, Brahmä, who resides in the higher planetary system in the sky, had observed the activities of the most powerful Kåñëa in killing and delivering Aghäsura, and he was astonished. Now that same Brahmä wanted to show some of his own power and see the power of Kåñëa, who was engaged in His childhood pastimes, playing as if with ordinary cowherd boys. Therefore, in Kåñëa's absence, Brahmä took all the boys and calves to another place. Thus he became entangled, for in the very near future he would see how powerful Kåñëa was.",

Thus he became entangled in Kåñëa's mäyä. After all, Brahmä was born materially. As mentioned here, ambhojanma janiù: he was born of ambhoja, a lotus flower. It does not matter that he was born of a lotus and not of any man, animal or material father. A lotus is also material, and anyone born through the material energy must be subject to the four material deficiencies: bhrama (the tendency to commit mistakes), pramäda (the tendency to be illusioned), vipralipsä (the tendency to cheat) and karaëäpäöava (imperfect senses). Thus Brahmä also became entangled."

These cowherd boys were but expansions of Kåñëa's personal self (änanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhävitäbhiù (BS 5.37)). Later Kåñëa would show Brahmä how He expands Himself into everything as His personal pleasure, änanda-cinmaya-rasa. Hlädiné çaktir asmät: Kåñëa has a transcendental potency called hlädiné çakti. He does not enjoy anything that is a product of the material energy. Brahmä, therefore, would see Lord Kåñëa expand His energy."

Rävaëa wanted to take away Sétä, but that was impossible, and instead he took away a mäyä Sétä. Similarly, Brahmä took away mäyärbhakäù: boys manifested by Kåñëa's mäyä. Brahmä could show some extraordinary opulence to the mäyärbhakäù; but he could not show any extraordinary potency to Kåñëa's associates. That he would see in the very near future. Mäyärbhakasya éçituù. This bewilderment, this mäyä, was caused by the supreme controller, prabhavataù—the all-potent Supreme person, Kåñëa—and we shall see the result. Anyone materially born is subject to bewilderment. This pastime is therefore called brahma-vimohana-lélä, the pastime of bewildering Brahmä. Mohitaà näbhijänäti mäm ebhyaù param avyayam . Everyone, from Brahmä down to the small insect, must take lessons from Kåñëa."
