            "content": "The omen spoke of añöamo garbhaù, referring to the eighth pregnancy, but did not clearly say whether the child was to be a son or a daughter. Even if Kaàsa were to see that the eighth child of Devaké was a daughter, he should have no doubt that the eighth child was to kill him. According to the Viçva-koça dictionary, the word garbha means \"embryo\" and also arbhaka, or \"child.\" Kaàsa was affectionate toward his sister, and therefore he had become the chariot driver to carry her and his brother-in-law to their home. The demigods, however, did not want Kaàsa to be affectionate toward Devaké, and therefore, from an unseen position, they encouraged Kaàsa to offend her. Moreover, the six sons of Maréci had been cursed to take birth from the womb of Devaké, and upon being killed by Kaàsa they would be delivered. When Devaké understood that Kaàsa would be killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who would appear from her womb, she felt great joy. The word vahase is also significant because it indicates that the ominous vibration condemned Kaàsa for acting just like a beast of burden by carrying his enemy's mother."
