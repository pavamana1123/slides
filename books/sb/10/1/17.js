            "content": "\"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I appear Myself.\" When the residents of this earth become atheistic and godless, they descend to the status of animals like dogs and hogs, and thus their only business is to bark among themselves. This is dharmasya gläni, deviation from the goal of life. Human life is meant for attaining the highest perfection of Kåñëa consciousness, but when people are godless and the presidents or kings are unnecessarily puffed up with military power, their business is to fight and increase the military strength of their different states. Nowadays, therefore, it appears that every state is busy manufacturing atomic weapons to prepare for a third world war. Such preparations are certainly unnecessary; they reflect the false pride of the heads of state. The real business of a chief executive is to see to the happiness of the mass of people by training them in Kåñëa consciousness in different divisions of life. Cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù . A leader should train the people as brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras and engage them in various occupational duties, thus helping them progress toward Kåñëa consciousness. Instead, however, rogues and thieves in the guise of protectors arrange for a voting system, and in the name of democracy they come to power by hook or crook and exploit the citizens. Even long, long ago, asuras, persons devoid of God consciousness, became the heads of state, and now this is happening again. The various states of the world are preoccupied with arranging for military strength. Sometimes they spend sixty-five percent of the government's revenue for this purpose. But why should people's hard-earned money be spent in this way? Because of the present world situation, Kåñëa has descended in the form of the Kåñëa consciousness movement. This is quite natural, for without the Kåñëa consciousness movement the world cannot be peaceful and happy."
