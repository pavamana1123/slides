Such glorification is relished by those no longer interested in the false, temporary glorification of this cosmic manifestation. Descriptions of the Lord are the right medicine for the conditioned soul undergoing repeated birth and death.

Although India is now fallen, when there is a message that someone will speak about Bhagavad-gétä or Çrémad-Bhägavatam, thousands of people still gather to hear. This verse indicates, however, that such recitation of Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam must be done by persons completely freed from material desires (nivåtta-tarñaiù). Everyone within this material world, beginning from Brahmä down to the insignificant ant, is full of material desires for sense enjoyment, and everyone is busy in sense gratification, but when thus engaged one cannot fully understand the value of kåñëa-kathä, either in the form of Bhagavad-gétä or in Çrémad-Bhägavatam."

Kåñëa-kathä is very simple. In Bhagavad-gétä it is said that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As He Himself explains, mattaù parataraà nänyat kiïcid asti dhanaïjaya: \"O Arjuna, there is no truth superior to Me.\"  Simply by understanding this fact—that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead—one can become a liberated person. But, especially in this age, because people are interested in hearing Bhagavad-gétä from unscrupulous persons who depart from the simple presentation of Bhagavad-gétä and distort it for their personal satisfaction, they fail to derive the real benefit. There are big scholars, politicians, philosophers and scientists who speak on Bhagavad-gétä in their own polluted way, and people in general hear from them, being uninterested in hearing the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from a devotee. A devotee is one who has no other motive for reciting Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam than to serve the Lord. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has therefore advised us to hear the glories of the Lord from a realized person (bhägavata paro diya bhägavata sthane). Unless one is personally a realized soul in the science of Kåñëa consciousness, a neophyte should not approach him to hear about the Lord, for this is strictly forbidden by Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, who quotes from the Padma Puräëa:"

A Vaiñëava is nivåtta-tåñëa; that is, he has no material purpose, for his only purpose is to preach Kåñëa consciousness. So-called scholars, philosophers and politicians exploit the importance of Bhagavad-gétä by distorting its meaning for their own purposes. Therefore this verse warns that kåñëa-kathä should be recited by a person who is nivåtta-tåñëa. Çukadeva Gosvämé epitomizes the proper reciter for Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and Parékñit Mahäräja, who purposefully left his kingdom and family prior to meeting death, epitomizes the person fit to hear it. A qualified reciter of Çrémad-Bhägavatam gives the right medicine (bhavauñadhi) for the conditioned souls. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore trying to train qualified preachers to recite Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä throughout the entire world, so that people in general in all parts of the world may take advantage of this movement and thus be relieved of the threefold miseries of material existence."

Two classes of men, however, will never be interested in hearing the message of Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam—those who are determined to commit suicide and those determined to kill cows and other animals for the satisfaction of their own tongues. Although such persons may make a show of hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam at a Bhägavata-saptäha, this is but another creation of the karmés, who cannot derive any benefit from such a performance. The word paçu-ghnät is important in this connection. paçu-ghna means \"butcher.\" Persons fond of performing ritualistic ceremonies for elevation to the higher planetary systems must offer sacrifices (yajïas) by killing animals. Lord Buddhadeva therefore rejected the authority of the Vedas because his mission was to stop animal sacrifices, which are recommended in Vedic ritualistic ceremonies."

One can actually see how this attitude automatically develops in persons who are Kåñëa conscious. Although the devotees of the Kåñëa consciousness movement are quite young men, they no longer read materialistic newspapers, magazines and so on, for they are no longer interested in such topics (nivåtta-tarñaiù). They completely give up the bodily understanding of life. For topics concerning Uttamaçloka, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the spiritual master speaks, and the disciple hears with attention. Unless both of them are free from material desires, they cannot be interested in topics of Kåñëa consciousness. The spiritual master and disciple do not need to understand anything more than Kåñëa because simply by understanding Kåñëa and talking about Kåñëa, one becomes a perfectly learned person (yasmin vijïäte sarvam evaà vijïätaà bhavati, Muëòaka Upaniñad 1.3).

These topics are the medicine to stop the repetition of birth and death. The cycle of repeated birth and death, by which one takes on different bodies again and again, is called bhava or bhava-roga. If anyone, willingly or unwillingly, hears kåñëa-kathä, his bhava-roga, the disease of birth and death, will certainly stop. Therefore kåñëa-kathä is called bhavauñadha, the remedy to stop the repetition of birth and death. Karmés, or persons attached to material sense enjoyment, generally cannot give up their material desires, but kåñëa-kathä is such a potent medicine that if one is induced to hear kåñëa-kértana, he will certainly be freed from this disease. A practical example is Dhruva Mahäräja, who at the end of his tapasya was fully satisfied. When the Lord wanted to give Dhruva a benediction, Dhruva refused it. Svämin kåtärtho'smi varaà na yäce . \"My dear Lord,\" he said, \"I am fully satisfied. I do not ask for any benediction for material sense gratification.\" We actually see that even young boys and girls in the Kåñëa consciousness movement have given up their long practice of bad habits like illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Because Kåñëa consciousness is so potent that it gives them full satisfaction, they are no longer interested in material sense gratification."
