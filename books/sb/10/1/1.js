He spoke of how Kåñëa had personally appeared to reduce the burden on the earth, how He had manifested His pastimes as a householder, and how, soon after His birth, He had transferred Himself to His Vrajabhümi-lélä. Parékñit Mahäräja, being naturally a devotee of Kåñëa, wanted to hear more about Lord Kåñëa. Therefore, to encourage Çukadeva Gosvämé to continue speaking about Kåñëa and give further details, he thanked Çukadeva Gosvämé for having described the activities of Kåñëa in brief. Çukadeva Gosvämé had said:"

            "content": "The Yadu dynasty belonged to the family descending from Soma, the moon-god. Although the planetary systems are so arranged that the sun comes first, before the moon, Parékñit Mahäräja gave more respect to the dynasty of the moon-god, the soma-vaàça, because in the Yädava dynasty, descending from the moon, Kåñëa had appeared. There are two different kñatriya families of the royal order, one descending from the king of the moon planet and the other descending from the king of the sun. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He generally appears in a kñatriya family because He comes to establish religious principles and the life of righteousness. According to the Vedic system, the kñatriya family is the protector of the human race. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as Lord Rämacandra, He appeared in the sürya-vaàça, the family descending from the sun-god, and when He appeared as Lord Kåñëa, He did so in the Yadu dynasty, or yadu-vaàça, whose descent was from the moon-god. In the Ninth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, there is a long list of the kings of the yadu-vaàça. All the kings in both the soma-vaàça and sürya-vaàça were great and powerful, and Mahäräja Parékñit praised them very highly (räjïäà cobhaya-vaàçyänäà caritaà paramädbhutam). Nonetheless, he wanted to hear more about the soma-vaàça because that was the dynasty in which Kåñëa had appeared."

The Våndävana-dhäma on this earth is a replica of that same abode. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä —will be found here, in the Tenth Canto."
