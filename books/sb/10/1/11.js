His bodily feature is naräkåti, that is, exactly like that of a human being. Here the same idea is repeated in the words mänuñam äçritya, which indicate that He accepts a body exactly like that of a man. Everywhere it is confirmed that Kåñëa is never niräkära, or formless. He has His form, exactly like that of a human being. There is no doubt about this."
