This ceremony is called näma-karaëa. There are ten different saàskäras, or reformatory methods, adopted in the system of varëäçrama-dharma, and the name-giving ceremony is one of them. Although Vasudeva's first son was to be delivered into the hands of Kaàsa, the näma-karaëa ceremony was performed, and thus the child was named Kértimän. Such names are given immediately after birth."
