    "translation": "Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé said: O Your Majesty, best of all saintly kings, because you are greatly attracted to topics of Väsudeva, it is certain that your intelligence is firmly fixed in spiritual understanding, which is the only true goal for humanity. Because that attraction is unceasing, it is certainly sublime.",

            "content": "Kåñëa-kathä is compulsory for the räjarñi, or executive head of government. This is also mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä (imaà räjarñayo viduù ). Unfortunately, however, in this age the governmental power is gradually being captured by third-class and fourth-class men who have no spiritual understanding, and society is therefore very quickly becoming degraded. Kåñëa-kathä must be understood by the executive heads of government, for otherwise how will people be happy and gain relief from the pangs of materialistic life? One who has fixed his mind in Kåñëa consciousness should be understood to have very sharp intelligence in regard to the value of life. Mahäräja Parékñit was räjarñi-sattama, the best of all saintly kings, and Çukadeva Gosvämé was muni-sattama, the best of munis. Both of them were elevated because of their common interest in kåñëa-kathä. The exalted position of the speaker and the audience will be explained very nicely in the next verse. Kåñëa-kathä is so enlivening that Mahäräja Parékñit forgot everything material, even his personal comfort in relation to food and drink. This is an example of how the Kåñëa consciousness movement should spread all over the world to bring both the speaker and the audience to the transcendental platform and back home, back to Godhead."
