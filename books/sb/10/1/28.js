Våndävana is within the jurisdiction of Mathurä, and it still continues to exist. Because Mathurä and Våndävana are intimately connected with Kåñëa eternally, it is said that Lord Kåñëa never leaves Våndävana (våndävanaà parityajya padam ekaà na gacchati). At present, the place known as Våndävana, in the district of Mathurä, continues its position as a transcendental place, and certainly anyone who goes there becomes transcendentally purified. Navadvépa-dhäma is also intimately connected with Vrajabhümi. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura therefore says:"

            "content": "\"Vrajabhümi\" refers to Mathurä-Våndävana, and Gauòa-maëòala-bhümi includes Navadvépa. These two places are nondifferent. Therefore, anyone living in Navadvépa-dhäma, knowing Kåñëa and Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu to be the same personality, lives in Vrajabhümi, Mathurä-Våndävana. The Lord has made it convenient for the conditioned soul to live in Mathurä, Våndävana and Navadvépa and thus be directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Simply by living in these places, one can immediately come in contact with the Lord. There are many devotees who vow never to leave Våndävana and Mathurä. This is undoubtedly a good vow, but if one leaves Våndävana, Mathurä or Navadvépa-dhäma for the service of the Lord, he is not disconnected from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At any rate, we must understand the transcendental importance of Mathurä-Våndävana and Navadvépa-dhäma. Anyone who executes devotional service in these places certainly goes back home, back to Godhead, after giving up his body. Thus the words mathurä bhagavän yatra nityaà sannihito hariù are particularly important. A devotee should fully utilize this instruction to the best of his ability. Whenever the Supreme Lord personally appears, He appears in Mathurä because of His intimate connection with this place. Therefore although Mathurä and Våndävana are situated on this planet earth, they are transcendental abodes of the Lord."
