    "translation": "What is painful for saintly persons who strictly adhere to the truth? How could there not be independence for pure devotees who know the Supreme Lord as the substance? What deeds are forbidden for persons of the lowest character? And what cannot be given up for the sake of Lord Kåñëa by those who have fully surrendered at His lotus feet?",

            "content": "Since the eighth son of Devaké was to kill Kaàsa, one might ask what the need was for Vasudeva to deliver the first-born child. The answer is that Vasudeva had promised Kaàsa that he would deliver all the children born of Devaké. Kaàsa, being an asura, did not believe that the eighth child would kill him; he took it for granted that he might be killed by any of the children of Devaké. Vasudeva, therefore, to save Devaké, promised to give Kaàsa every child, whether male or female. From another point of view, Vasudeva and Devaké were very pleased when they understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, would come as their eighth son. Vasudeva, a pure devotee of the Lord, was eager to see Kåñëa appear as his child from the eighth pregnancy of Devaké. Therefore he wanted to deliver all the children quickly so that the eighth turn would come and Kåñëa would appear. He begot one child every year so that Kåñëa's turn to appear would come as soon as possible."
