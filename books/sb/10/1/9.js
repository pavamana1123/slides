Just after His birth in the house of Vasudeva in Mathurä, Kåñëa transferred Himself to Gokula, on the other side of the Yamunä, and after some days He moved with His father, mother and other relatives to Nanda-gräma, Våndävana. Mahäräja Parékñit was very much eager to hear about Kåñëa's activities in Våndävana. This entire canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam is full of activities performed in Våndävana and Dvärakä. The first forty chapters describe Kåñëa's Våndävana affairs, and the next fifty describe Kåñëa's activities in Dvärakä. Mahäräja Parékñit, to fulfill his desire to hear about Kåñëa, requested Çukadeva Gosvämé to describe these activities in full detail."
