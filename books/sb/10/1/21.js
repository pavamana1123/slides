    "translation": "While in trance, Lord Brahmä heard the words of Lord Viñëu vibrating in the sky. Thus he told the demigods: O demigods, hear from me the order of Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, the Supreme Person, and execute it attentively without delay.",

            "content": "It appears that the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be heard in trance by competent persons. Modern science gives us telephones, by which one can hear sound vibrations from a distant place. Similarly, although other persons cannot hear the words of Lord Viñëu, Lord Brahmä is able to hear the Lord's words within himself. This is confirmed in the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam ). The causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is neglected by such demoniac persons, who cannot understand the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä and who therefore misinterpret them."
