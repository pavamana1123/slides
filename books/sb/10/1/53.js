            "content": "Sometimes one must act duplicitously in a dangerous position, as Vasudeva did to save his wife. The material world is complicated, and to execute one's duties, one cannot avoid adopting such diplomacy. Vasudeva did everything possible to save his wife for the sake of begetting Kåñëa. This indicates that one may act duplicitously for the purpose of saving Kåñëa and His interests. According to the arrangement already foretold, Kåñëa was to appear through Vasudeva and Devaké to kill Kaàsa. Vasudeva, therefore, had to do everything to save the situation. Although all the events were prearranged by Kåñëa, a devotee must try his best to serve the purpose of Kåñëa. Kåñëa Himself is all-powerful, but it is not that a devotee should therefore sit idly and leave everything to Him. This instruction is also found in Bhagavad-gétä. Although Kåñëa was doing everything for Arjuna, Arjuna never sat down idly as a nonviolent gentleman. Rather, he tried his best to fight the battle and be victorious."
