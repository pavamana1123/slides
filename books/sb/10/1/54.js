Vasudeva, therefore, to assure his brother-in-law the utmost safety, promised to bring him all the sons. He would not wait for the eighth son, but from the very beginning would deliver to the hands of Kaàsa all the sons to which Devaké would give birth. This was the most liberal proposition offered by Vasudeva to Kaàsa."
