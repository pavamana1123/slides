As a human being, he was certainly both hungry and thirsty, and therefore Çukadeva Gosvämé might have wanted to stop narrating the transcendental topics of Kåñëa; but despite his fast, Mahäräja Parékñit was not at all fatigued. \"The hunger and thirst from my fast do not disturb me,\" he said. \"Once when I felt very thirsty, I went to the äçrama of Çaméka Muni to drink water, but the muni did not supply it. I therefore wrapped a dead snake over his shoulder, and that is why I was cursed by the brähmaëa boy. Now, however, I am quite fit. I am not at all disturbed by my hunger and thirst.\" This indicates that although on the material platform there are disturbances from hunger and thirst, on the spiritual platform there is no such thing as fatigue."

Unfortunately, however, the world is completely unaware of the nectar of kåñëa-kathä. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore a boon to philosophers, religionists and people in general. There is certainly a charming attraction in Kåñëa and kåñëa-kathä. Therefore the Absolute Truth is called Kåñëa, the most attractive."

To stop this repetition of birth and death, kåñëa-kathä, or Kåñëa consciousness, is absolutely necessary. But unless one hears kåñëa-kathä from a realized soul like Çukadeva Gosvämé, one cannot relish the nectar of kåñëa-kathä, which puts an end to all material fatigue, and enjoy the blissful life of transcendental existence. In relation to the Kåñëa consciousness movement, we actually see that those who have tasted the nectar of kåñëa-kathä lose all material desires, whereas those who cannot understand Kåñëa or kåñëa-kathä regard the Kåñëa conscious life as \"brainwashing\" and \"mind control.\" While the devotees enjoy spiritual bliss, the nondevotees are surprised that the devotees have forgotten material hankerings."
