    "translation": "The inhabitants of Våndävana, headed by Nanda Mahäräja and including his associate cowherd men and their wives, were none but denizens of the heavenly planets, O Mahäräja Parékñit, best of the descendants of Bharata, and so too were the descendants of the Våñëi dynasty, headed by Vasudeva, and Devaké and the other women of the dynasty of Yadu. The friends, relatives and well-wishers of both Nanda Mahäräja and Vasudeva and even those who externally appeared to be followers of Kaàsa were all demigods.",

The Lord ordered all the denizens of the heavenly planets to take birth in different families of the Yadu and Våñëi dynasties and in Våndävana. Now this verse informs us that all the family and friends of the Yadu dynasty, the Våñëi dynasty, Nanda Mahäräja and the gopas descended from the heavenly planets to see the pastimes of the Lord. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä , the Lord's pastimes consist of pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm—saving the devotees and killing the demons. To demonstrate these activities, the Lord called for devotees from different parts of the universe."
