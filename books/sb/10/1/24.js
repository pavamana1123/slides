    "translation": "The foremost manifestation of Kåñëa is Saìkarñaëa, who is known as Ananta. He is the origin of all incarnations within this material world. Previous to the appearance of Lord Kåñëa, this original Saìkarñaëa will appear as Baladeva, just to please the Supreme Lord Kåñëa in His transcendental pastimes.",

He is equal in supremacy to the Supreme Godhead, yet wherever Kåñëa appears, Çré Baladeva appears as His brother, sometimes elder and sometimes younger. When Kåñëa appears, all His plenary expansions and other incarnations appear with Him. This is elaborately explained in Caitanya-caritämåta. This time, Baladeva would appear before Kåñëa as Kåñëa's elder brother."
