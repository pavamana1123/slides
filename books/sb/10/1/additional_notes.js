When one is awake, whatever one sees or hears is impressed upon the mind, which later works in dreams to show one different experiences, although in dreams one appears to accept a different body. For example, when one is awake one does business and talks with customers, and similarly in dreams one meets various customers, talks about business and gives quotations. Madhväcärya says, therefore, that dreams take place according to what one sees, hears and remembers. When one reawakens, of course, one forgets the body of the dream. This forgetfulness is called apasmåti. Thus we are changing bodies because we are sometimes dreaming, sometimes awake and sometimes forgetful. Forgetfulness of our previously created body is called death, and our work in the present body is called life. After death, one cannot remember the activities of one's previous body, whether imaginary or factual."

Rather, Kåñëa appeared in fullness, and He manifests Himself partially in the Vaikuëöhalokas. In other words, Lord Viñëu is a partial representation of Kåñëa; Kåñëa is not a partial representation of Viñëu. In the Caitanya-caritämåta, Adi-lélä, Chapter Four, this subject matter is explained very clearly. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura also notes that no one can describe Kåñëa in fullness. Whatever descriptions we find in Çrémad-Bhägavatam are partial explanations of Kåñëa.

Even ordinary persons not very much advanced in Kåñëa consciousness take pleasure in describing the narrations depicted in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. When a materialistic person is purified in this way, he engages in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord.

As described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, , because pure devotees, who no longer have any material desires, surrender fully to the lotus feet of the Lord, they always merge in the ocean of bliss by chanting and hearing the Lord's holy name. According to this verse, devotees like Närada and other residents of Çvetadvépa are seen always engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord because by such chanting they are always externally and internally blissful. The mumukñus, persons desiring to be liberated, do not depend on the pleasures of the senses; instead, they concentrate fully on becoming liberated by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Karmés like to create something pleasing to their ears and hearts, and although they sometimes like to chant or hear the glories of the Lord, they do not do it openly. Devotees, however, always spontaneously hear, chant about and remember the activities of the Lord, and by this process they are fully satisfied, even though these may seem like topics of sense gratification. Simply by hearing the transcendental narrations of the Lord's activities, Parékñit Mahäräja was liberated. He was therefore çrotramano-'bhiräma; that is, he glorified the process of hearing.

Especially excluded from spiritual life are the animal hunters, who are not interested in hearing and chanting the holy name of the Lord. Such hunters are always unhappy, both in this life and in the next. It is therefore said that a hunter should neither die nor live because for such persons both living and dying are troublesome.

Lord Kåñëa and Lord Rämacandra, who both look blackish, give liberation and transcendental bliss to Their devotees. Among persons possessing material bodies, sometimes someone is able to subject death to his own will. For such a person, death is almost impossible because no one wants to die. But although Bhéñmadeva possessed this power, Bhéñma, by the supreme will of the Lord, died very easily in the Lord's presence. There have also been many demons who had no hope of salvation, yet Kaàsa attained salvation by the supreme will of the Lord. Not to speak of Kaàsa, even Pütanä attained salvation and reached the level of the Lord's mother. Parékñit Mahäräja, therefore, was very eager to hear about the Lord, who has inconceivable qualities by which to give liberation to anyone. Parékñit Mahäräja, at the point of his death, was certainly interested in his liberation. When such a great and exalted personality as the Lord behaves like an ordinary human being although possessing inconceivable qualities, His behavior is called mäyä. Therefore the Lord is described as mäyä-manuñya. This is the opinion of Çréla Jéva Gosvämé. Mu refers to mukti, or salvation, and ku refers to that which is bad or very obnoxious. Thus muku refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who saves one from the bad condition of material existence. The Lord is called mukunda because He not only saves the devotee from material existence but offers him transcendental bliss in love and service."

This is also clearly stated in the Mahäbhärata, Mokña-dharma, and the next chapter of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has His abode in Goloka (goloka-nämni nija-dhämni tale ca tasya (BS 5.43)). From Lord Kåñëa come the catur-vyüha, the quadruple expansions Saìkarñaëa, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Väsudeva.

Although Baladeva is identical with Saìkarñaëa, He is the origin of Saìkarñaëa. Therefore the word svaräö has been used to indicate that Baladeva always exists in His own independence. The word svaräö also indicates that Baladeva is beyond the material conception of existence. Mäyä cannot attract Him, but because He is fully independent, He can appear by His spiritual potency wherever He likes. Mäyä is fully under the control of Viñëu. Because the material potency and yogamäyä mingle in the Lord's appearance, they are described as ekänaàçä.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead ordered yogamäyä to bewilder His associates in His pastimes and bewilder demons like Kaàsa. As stated previously, yogamäyäà samädiçat. To give service to the Lord, yogamäyä appeared along with mahämäyä. Mahämäyä refers to yayä sammohitaà jagat, \"one who bewilders the entire material world.\" From this statement it is to be understood that yogamäyä, in her partial expansion, becomes mahämäyä and bewilders the conditioned souls. In other words, the entire creation has two divisions-transcendental, or spiritual, and material. Yogamäyä manages the spiritual world, and by her partial expansion as mahämäyä she manages the material world. As stated in the Närada-païcarätra, mahämäyä is a partial expansion of yogamäyä. The Närada-païcarätra clearly states that the Supreme Personality has one potency, which is sometimes described as Durgä. The Brahma-saàhitä says, chäyeva yasya bhuvanäni bibharti durgä (BS 5.44). Durgä is not different from yogamäyä. When one understands Durgä properly, he is immediately liberated, for Durgä is originally the spiritual potency, hlädiné-çakti, by whose mercy one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. Rädhä kåñëa-praëaya-vikåtir hlädiné-çaktir asmäd . The mahämäyä-çakti, however, is a covering of yogamäyä, and she is therefore called the covering potency. By this covering potency, the entire material world is bewildered (yayä sammohitaà jagat). In conclusion, bewildering the conditioned souls and liberating the devotees are both functions belonging to yogamäyä. Transferring the pregnancy of Devaké and keeping mother Yaçodä in deep sleep were both done by yogamäyä; mahämäyä cannot act upon such devotees, for they are always liberated. But although it is not possible for mahämäyä to control liberated souls or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, she did bewilder Kaàsa. The action of yogamäyä in presenting herself before Kaàsa was the action of mahämäyä, not yogamäyä. Yogamäyä cannot even see or touch such polluted persons as Kaàsa. In Caëòé, in the Märkaëòeya Puräëa, Eleventh Chapter, Mahämäyä says, \"During the twenty-eighth yuga in the period of Vaivasvata Manu, I shall take birth as the daughter of Yaçodä and be known as Vindhyäcala-väsiné.\""

Kåñëa's räsa-lélä with the gopés and the gopés' bewilderment in respect to their husbands, fathers-in-law and other such relatives were arrangements of yogamäyä in which mahämäyä had no influence. The Bhägavatam gives sufficient evidence of this when it clearly says, yogamäyäm upäçritaù. On the other hand, there were asuras headed by Çälva and kñatriyas like Duryodhana who were bereft of devotional service in spite of seeing Kåñëa's carrier Garuòa and the universal form, and who could not understand Kåñëa to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This was also bewilderment, but this bewilderment was due to mahämäyä. Therefore it is to be concluded that the mäyä which drags a person from the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called jaòamäyä, and the mäyä which acts on the transcendental platform is called yogamäyä. When Nanda Mahäräja was taken away by Varuëa, he saw Kåñëa's opulence, but nonetheless he thought of Kåñëa as his son.

When Kaàsa was about to kill Devaké, Vasudeva wanted to dissuade him by the diplomacy of säma and bheda. Säma means \"pacifying.\" Vasudeva wanted to pacify Kaàsa by indicating relations, gain, welfare, identity and glorification. Reference to these five concerns constitutes säma, and Vasudeva's presentation of fear in two situations-in this life and the next-is called bheda. Thus Vasudeva used both säma and bheda to pacify Kaàsa. Praising Kaàsa's qualifications was glorification, and praising him as a descendant of the bhoja-vaàça appealed to sambandha, relationship. Speaking of \"your sister\" was an appeal to identity. Speaking about killing a woman raises questions about fame and welfare, and arousing fear of the sinful act of killing one's sister during her marriage ceremony is an aspect of bheda. The Bhoja dynasty refers to those who were simply interested in sense gratification and were therefore not very aristocratic. Another meaning of bhoja is \"fighting.\" These were indications of defamation for Kaàsa. When Vasudeva addressed Kaàsa as déna-vatsala, this was excessive praise. Kaàsa would accept calves as a form of revenue from his poor constituents, and therefore he was called déna-vatsala. Vasudeva knew very well that he could not by force rescue Devaké from the imminent danger. Devaké was actually the daughter of Kaàsa's uncle, and therefore she is described as suhåt, meaning \"relative.\" It is stated that Kaàsa refrained from killing his close relation Devaké because if he had killed her, a great fight would have ensued among the other members of the family. Kaàsa refrained from provoking this great danger of a family fight, for it would have caused many persons to lose their lives."

They were known as the ñaò-garbhas, or six garbhas, and they were all equally powerful and expert in military affairs. These ñaò-garbhas gave up the association of Hiraëyakaçipu, their grandfather, and underwent great austerities to satisfy Lord Brahmä, who, upon being satisfied, agreed to give them whatever benediction they might desire. When asked by Lord Brahmä to state what they wanted, the ñäò-garbhas replied, \"Dear Lord Brahmä, if you want to give us a benediction, give us the blessing that we will not be killed by any demigod, mahä-roga, Yakña, Gandharva-pati, Siddha, Cäraëa or human being, nor by great sages who are perfect in their penances and austerities.\" Brahmä understood their purpose and fulfilled their desire. But when Hiraëyakaçipu came to know of these events, he was very angry at his grandsons. \"You have given up my association and have gone to worship Lord Brahmä,\" he said, \"and therefore I no longer have any affection for you. You have tried to save yourselves from the hands of the demigods, but I curse you in this way: Your father will take birth as Kaàsa and kill all of you because you will take birth as sons of Devaké.\" Because of this curse, the grandsons of Hiraëyakaçipu had to take birth from the womb of Devaké and be killed by Kaàsa, although he was previously their father. This description is mentioned in the Hari-vaàça, Viñëu-parva, Second Chapter. According to the comments of the Vaiñëava-toñaëé, the son of Devaké known as Kértimän was the third incarnation. In his first incarnation he was known as Smara and was the son of Maréci, and later he became the son of Kälanemi. This is mentioned in the histories."

When the messenger approached Kaàsa and informed him of Närada's arrival, Kaàsa, the leader of the asuras, was very happy and immediately came out of his palace to receive Närada, who was as bright as the sun, as powerful as fire, and free from all tinges of sinful activities. Kaàsa accepted Närada as his guest, offered him respectful obeisances and gave him a golden seat, brilliant like the sun. Närada was a friend of the King of heaven, and thus he told Kaàsa, the son of Ugrasena, \"My dear hero, you have satisfied me with a proper reception, and therefore I shall tell you something secret and confidential. While I was coming here from Nandakänana through the Caitraratha forest, I saw a great meeting of the demigods, who followed me to Sumeru Parvata. We traveled through many holy places, and finally we saw the holy Ganges. While Lord Brahmä was consulting the other demigods at the top of Sumeru Hill, I was also present with my stringed instrument, the véëä. I shall tell you confidentially that the meeting was held just to plan to kill the asuras, headed by you. You have a younger sister named Devaké, and it is a fact that her eighth son will kill you.\" (reference: Hari-vaàça, Viñëu-parva 1.2-16)"

            "content": "No one can blame Näradajé for encouraging Kaàsa to kill the sons of Devaké. The saint Närada is always a well-wisher for human society, and he wanted the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, to descend to this world as soon as possible so that the society of demigods would be pleased and would see Kaàsa and his friends killed by Kåñëa. Kaàsa would also attain salvation from his nefarious activities, and this too would very much please the demigods and their followers. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura remarks in this connection that Närada Muni sometimes did things that were beneficial to the demigods and the demons simultaneously. Çré Véraräghava Äcärya, in his commentary, has included the following half-verse in this regard: asuräù sarva evaita lokopadrava-käriëaù. Asuras are always disturbing elements for human society."
