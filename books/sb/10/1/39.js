            "content": "\"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.\"  A person or an animal is not the material body; rather, the material body is the covering of the living being. Bhagavad-gétä compares the body to a dress and elaborately explains how one changes dresses one after another. The same Vedic knowledge is confirmed here. The living being, the soul, is constantly changing bodies one after another. Even in the present life, the body changes from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to youth, and from youth to old age; similarly, when the body is too old to continue, the living being gives up this body and, by the laws of nature, automatically gets another body according to his fruitive activities, desires and ambitions. The laws of nature control this sequence, and therefore as long as the living entity is under the control of the external, material energy, the process of bodily change takes place automatically, according to one's fruitive activities. Vasudeva therefore wanted to impress upon Kaàsa that if he committed this sinful act of killing a woman, in his next life he would certainly get a material body still more conditioned to the sufferings of material existence. Thus Vasudeva advised Kaàsa not to commit sinful activities."

Lusty desires and greed keep the living entity perpetually in ignorance and prevent him from being elevated to the platform of sattva-guëa or çuddha-sattva-guëa. One is advised to be situated in çuddha-sattva-guëa, devotional service, for thus one is immune to the reactions of the three modes of material nature."
