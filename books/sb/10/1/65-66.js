    "translation": "After the departure of the great saint Närada, Kaàsa thought that all the members of the Yadu dynasty were demigods and that any of the children born from the womb of Devaké might be Viñëu. Fearing his death, Kaàsa arrested Vasudeva and Devaké and chained them with iron shackles. Suspecting each of the children to be Viñëu, Kaàsa killed them one after another because of the prophecy that Viñëu would kill him.",

Närada Muni went to see Kaàsa by providence, and Kaàsa received him very well. Närada, therefore, informed him that any one of the sons of Devaké might be Viñëu. Because Viñëu was to kill him, Kaàsa should not spare any of Devaké's children, Närada Muni advised. Närada's intention was that Kaàsa, by killing the children, would increase his sinful activities so that Kåñëa would soon appear to kill him. Upon receiving the instructions of Närada Muni, Kaàsa killed all the children of Devaké one after another."

Kaàsa attempted to kill all the babies born of Devaké and Vasudeva, although he knew that if Viñëu were born, He would not be killed. Actually it came to pass that when Viñëu appeared as Kåñëa, Kaàsa could not kill Him; rather, as foretold, it was He who killed Kaàsa. One should know in truth how Kåñëa, who takes His birth transcendentally, acts to kill the demons but is never killed. When one perfectly understands Kåñëa in this way, through the medium of çästra, one becomes immortal. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä :"
