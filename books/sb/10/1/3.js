If religionists, philosophers and people in general simply hear the activities of Kåñëa, they will be liberated. We have described several times that there are two kinds of kåñëa-kathä, represented by Bhagavad-gétä, spoken personally by Kåñëa about Himself, and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, spoken by Çukadeva Gosvämé about the glories of Kåñëa. Anyone who becomes even slightly interested in kåñëa-kathä is liberated. Kértanäd eva kåñëasya mukta-saìgaù paraà vrajet . This is the mission of Kåñëa consciousness: to hear about Kåñëa and thus be liberated from material bondage."
