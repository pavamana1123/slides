    "translation": "Vasudeva considered: By delivering all my sons to Kaàsa, who is death personified, I shall save the life of Devaké. Perhaps Kaàsa will die before my sons take birth, or, since he is already destined to die at the hands of my son, one of my sons may kill him. For the time being, let me promise to hand over my sons so that Kaàsa will give up this immediate threat, and if in due course of time Kaàsa dies, I shall have nothing to fear.",

Even if a son is born and I deliver him to Kaàsa, Kaàsa may die at his hands, for by providence anything could happen. It is very difficult to understand how things are managed by providence.\" Thus Vasudeva decided that he would promise to deliver his sons to the hands of Kaàsa in order to save Devaké from the imminent danger of death."
