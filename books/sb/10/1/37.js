Vasudeva stressed that Devaké was not only a woman but a member of Kaàsa s family. Because she was now married to Vasudeva, she was para-stré, another man's wife, and if such a woman were killed, not only would Kaàsa be implicated in sinful activities, but his reputation as king of the Bhoja dynasty would be damaged. Thus Vasudeva tried in many ways to convince Kaàsa in order to stop him from killing Devaké."
