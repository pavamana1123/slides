    "synonyms": "tasmät—therefore; na—not; kasyacit—of anyone; droham—envy; äcaret—one should act; saù—a person (Kaàsa); tathä-vidhaù—who has been advised in such a way (by Vasudeva); ätmanaù—his own; kñemam—welfare; anvicchan—if he desires; drogdhuù—of one who is envious of others; vai—indeed; parataù—from others; bhayam—there is a cause of fear.",
    "translation": "Therefore, since envious, impious activities cause a body in which one suffers in the next life, why should one act impiously? Considering one's welfare, one should not envy anyone, for an envious person must always fear harm from his enemies, either in this life or in the next.",
