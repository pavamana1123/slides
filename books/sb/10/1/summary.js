Kåñëa is transcendental, the King said, and therefore to understand His activities is the occupation of liberated persons. Hearing of kåñëa-lélä is the boat by which to achieve the ultimate goal of life. Except for an animal killer or one who is following a policy of suicide, every intelligent person must strive to understand Kåñëa and His activities."

Now Mahäräja Parékñit asked Çukadeva Gosvämé how His Lordship Baladeva, the son of Rohiëé, could have appeared in the womb of Devaké. Why did Kåñëa transfer Himself from Mathurä to Våndävana, King Parékñit asked, and how did He live there with His family members? What did Kåñëa do in Mathurä and Våndävana, and why did He kill His maternal uncle Kaàsa? For how many years did Kåñëa reside in Dvärakä, and how many queens did He have? Mahäräja Parékñit asked Çukadeva Gosvämé all these questions. He also requested Çukadeva Gosvämé to describe other activities of Kåñëa about which he could not inquire."

The speaker, the inquirer and the audience all become purified.\""

Brahmä thereafter understood the advice of Mahä-Viñëu, who informed him that He would appear on the surface of the earth to mitigate the burden created by the demons. The demigods, along with their wives, should appear there as associates of Lord Kåñëa in the family of Yadu to increase the sons and grandsons in that dynasty. By the will of Lord Kåñëa, Anantadeva would appear first, as Balaräma, and Kåñëa's potency, yogamäyä, would also appear. Brahmä informed mother earth about all this, and then he returned to his own abode."

Upon hearing this omen, Kaàsa was immediately ready to kill Devaké, but Vasudeva diplomatically began to instruct him. Vasudeva stressed that it would not be good for Kaàsa to kill his younger sister, especially at the time of her marriage. Anyone who possesses a material body must die, Vasudeva advised him. Every living entity lives in a body for some time and then transmigrates to another body, but one is unfortunately misled into accepting the body as the soul. If a person under this mistaken conception wants to kill another body, he is condemned as hellish."

            "content": "Because Kaàsa was not satisfied by Vasudeva's instructions, Vasudeva devised a plan. He offered to bring Kaàsa all of Devaké's children so that Kaàsa could kill them. Why then should Kaàsa kill Devaké now? Kaàsa was satisfied by this proposal. In due course of time, when Devaké gave birth to a child, Vasudeva brought the newborn baby to Kaàsa, who, upon seeing Vasudeva's magnanimity, was struck with wonder. When Vasudeva gave Kaàsa the child, Kaàsa, showing some intelligence, said that since he was to be killed by the eighth child, why should he kill the first? Although Vasudeva did not trust him, Kaàsa requested Vasudeva to take the child back. Later, however, after Närada approached Kaàsa and disclosed to him that the demigods were appearing in the Yadu and Våñëi dynasties and conspiring to kill him, Kaàsa decided to kill all the children born in these families, and he also decided that any child born from the womb of Devaké must be killed. Thus he arrested and imprisoned both Devaké and Vasudeva and killed six of their sons, one after another. Närada had also informed Kaàsa that in his previous birth Kaàsa was Kälanemi, a demon killed by Viñëu. Consequently, Kaàsa became a great enemy to all the descendants of the yadu-vaàça, the Yadu dynasty. He even arrested and imprisoned his own father, Ugrasena, for Kaàsa wanted to enjoy the kingdom alone."

As already mentioned, in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam there are ninety chapters, which describe all these léläs. The first four chapters describe Brahmä's prayers for the relief of the earth's burden, and they also describe the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Chapters Five through Thirty-nine recount Kåñëa's pastimes in Våndävana. The Fortieth Chapter describes how Kåñëa enjoyed in the water of the Yamunä and how Akrüra offered prayers. Chapters Forty-one through Fifty-one, eleven chapters, tell of Kåñëa's pastimes in Mäthura, and Chapters Fifty-two through Ninety, thirty-nine chapters, relate Kåñëa's pastimes in Dvärakä."
