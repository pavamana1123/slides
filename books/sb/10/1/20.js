Aside from the demigods, even in human society there are many influential personalities supervising various businesses or establishments. Lord Viñëu, however, is the God of gods (parameçvara). He is parama-puruña, the Supreme Being, Paramätmä. As confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38), éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù: \"Kåñëa, known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body.\" No one is equal to or greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He is described here by many words: jagannätha, deva-deva, våñäkapi and puruña. The supremacy of Lord Viñëu is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä  in this statement by Arjuna:"
