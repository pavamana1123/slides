If Balaräma was not transferred from one body to another, how is it possible that He was first in the womb of Devaké and then in the womb of Rohiëé? Kindly explain this to me.",

Balaräma is well known as the son of Rohiëé, yet it is also known that He was the son of Devaké. Parékñit Mahäräja wanted to understand the mystery of Balaräma's being the son of both Devaké and Rohiëé."
