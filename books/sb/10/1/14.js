It is said that in Kali-yuga people have only short lives, and they have no culture of spiritual consciousness. If anyone is at all interested in spiritual culture, he is misled by many bogus svämés and yogés who do not refer to kåñëa-kathä. Therefore most people are unfortunate and disturbed by many calamities. Çréla Vyäsadeva prepared Çrémad-Bhägavatam at the request of Närada Muni in order to give relief to the suffering people of this age (kali-kalmaña-ghnam). The Kåñëa consciousness movement is seriously engaged in enlightening people through the pleasing topics of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. All over the world, the message of Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä is being accepted in all spheres of life, especially in advanced, educated circles."

Both words bear the same meaning; that is, Mahäräja Parékñit was a great devotee of Kåñëa, and Çukadeva Gosvämé was also a great saintly person and a great devotee of Kåñëa. Combined together to present kåñëa-kathä, they give great relief to suffering humanity."
