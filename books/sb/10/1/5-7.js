    "translation": "Taking the boat of Kåñëa's lotus feet, my grandfather Arjuna and others crossed the ocean of the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, in which such commanders as Bhéñmadeva resembled great fish that could very easily have swallowed them. By the mercy of Lord Kåñëa, my grandfathers crossed this ocean, which was very difficult to cross, as easily as one steps over the hoofprint of a calf. Because my mother surrendered unto Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet, the Lord, Sudarçana-cakra in hand, entered her womb and saved my body, the body of the last remaining descendant of the Kurus and the Päëòavas, which was almost destroyed by the fiery weapon of Açvatthämä. Lord Çré Kåñëa, appearing within and outside of all materially embodied living beings by His own potency in the forms of eternal time—that is, as Paramätmä and as viräö-rüpa—gave liberation to everyone, either as cruel death or as life. Kindly enlighten me by describing His transcendental characteristics.",
