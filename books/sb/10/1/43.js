    "translation": "When the luminaries in the sky, such as the moon, the sun and the stars, are reflected in liquids like oil or water, they appear to be of different shapes—sometimes round, sometimes long, and so on—because of the movements of the wind. Similarly, when the living entity, the soul, is absorbed in materialistic thoughts, he accepts various manifestations as his own identity because of ignorance. In other words, one is bewildered by mental concoctions because of agitation from the material modes of nature.",

The soul has form, but the external, agitating form he has acquired because of material contamination is false. Similarly, God is also described as niräkära, which means that God has no material form but is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1). The living entity is part and parcel of the supreme sac-cid-änanda-vigraha, but his material forms are temporary, or illusory. Both the living entity and the Supreme Lord have original, spiritual forms (sac-cid-änanda-vigraha), but the Lord, the Supreme, does not change His form. The Lord appears as He is, whereas the living entity appears because material nature forces him to accept different forms. When the living entity receives these different forms, he identifies with them, and not with his original, spiritual form. As soon as the living entity returns to his original, spiritual form and understanding, he immediately surrenders to the supreme form, the Personality of Godhead. This is explained in Bhagavad-gétä :"

As long as one is under an impersonal understanding of the Absolute Truth, he is not in pure knowledge, but must still struggle for pure knowledge. Kleço 'dhikataras teñäm avyaktäsakta-cetasäm . Although one may be spiritually advanced, if one is attached to the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth one must still work very hard, as indicated by the words kleço 'dhikataraù, which mean \"greater suffering.\" A devotee, however, easily attains his original position as a spiritual form and understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form."

They were individuals in the past, they are now situated in individuality, and in the future they will all continue to maintain their individual forms. The only difference is that the conditioned living entity appears in various material forms, whereas Kåñëa appears in His original, spiritual form. Unfortunately, those who are not advanced in spiritual knowledge think that Kåñëa is like one of them and that His form is like their material forms. Avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà tanum äçritam . Kåñëa is never puffed up by material knowledge and is therefore called acyuta, whereas the living entities fall down and are agitated by material nature. This is the difference between the Supreme Lord and the living entities."

Kaàsa, a representative of the demons, was always ready to kill Kåñëa, or God, whereas Vasudeva represents a transcendentally situated person to whom Kåñëa is born (Väsudeva is the son of Vasudeva). Vasudeva wanted his brother-in-law Kaàsa to refrain from the sinful act of killing his sister, since the result of being agitated by material nature would be that Kaàsa would have to accept a body in which to suffer again and again.

An intelligent person, therefore, must free himself from the influence of the three modes of material nature and revive his original, spiritual body by engaging in the service of the Supreme Person, Kåñëa. As long as one is materially attached, one must accept the process of birth, death, old age and disease. One is therefore advised that an intelligent person, instead of being entangled in so-called good and bad fruitive activities, should engage his life in advancing in Kåñëa consciousness so that instead of accepting another material body (tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti ), he will return home, back to Godhead."
