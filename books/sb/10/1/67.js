There have been many similar instances, and Kaàsa was the same type of king. Kaàsa did not hesitate to kill his nephews and imprison his sister and his father. For demons to do such things is not astonishing. Nonetheless, although Kaàsa was a demon, he was aware that Lord Viñëu cannot be killed, and thus he attained salvation. Even partial understanding of the activities of Lord Viñëu makes one eligible for salvation. Kaàsa knew a little about Kåñëa—that He could not be killed—and therefore he attained salvation although he thought of Viñëu, Kåñëa, as an enemy. What then is to be said of one who knows Kåñëa perfectly from the descriptions of çästras like Bhagavad-gétä? It is therefore the duty of everyone to read Bhagavad-gétä and understand Kåñëa perfectly. This will make one's life successful."
