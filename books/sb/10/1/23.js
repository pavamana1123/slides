From there, if his devotional service is complete, such a devotee is transferred to the place where the Lord's pastimes are going on. Herein it is said, sambhavantu sura-striyaù. Sura-stré, the women of the heavenly planets, were thus ordered to appear in the Yadu dynasty in Våndävana to enrich the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa. These sura-stré, when further trained to live with Kåñëa, would be transferred to the original Goloka Våndävana. During Lord Kåñëa's pastimes within this world, the sura-stré were to appear in different ways in different families to give pleasure to the Lord, just so that they would be fully trained before going to the eternal Goloka Våndävana. With the association of Lord Kåñëa, either at Dvärakä-puré, Mathurä-puré or Våndävana, they would certainly return home, back to Godhead. Among the sura-stré, the women of the heavenly planets, there are many devotees, such as the mother of the Upendra incarnation of Kåñëa. It was such devoted women who were called for in this connection."
