Vasudeva was so steadily equipoised that he did not seem in the least agitated when delivering his first-born child into the hands of Kaàsa to be killed. In Bhagavad-gétä  it is said, duùkheñv anudvigna-manäù sukheñu vigata-spåhaù. In the material world, one should not be very eager to be happy, nor should one be very much disturbed by material distress. Lord Kåñëa advised Arjuna:"

They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\"  The self-realized soul is never disturbed by so-called distress or happiness, and this is especially true of an exalted devotee like Vasudeva, who showed this by his practical example. Vasudeva was not at all disturbed when delivering his first child to Kaàsa to be killed."
