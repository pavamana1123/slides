Mahä-Viñëu is a plenary expansion of Saìkarñaëa, who is a plenary expansion of Näräyaëa. Näräyaëa is a plenary expansion of the catur-vyüha, and the catur-vyüha are plenary expansions of Baladeva, the first manifestation of Kåñëa.

Another meaning may be derived from this verse as follows, Although Çukadeva Gosvämé was the greatest muni, he could describe Kåñëa only partially (aàçena), for no one can describe Kåñëa fully. It is said that Anantadeva has thousands of heads, but although He tries to describe Kåñëa with thousands of tongues, His descriptions are still incomplete."
