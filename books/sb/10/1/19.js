Both maintenance and annihilation go on perpetually, under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm. Those who are obedient to the laws of God are protected by different servants and demigods, whereas those who are undesirable are vanquished by Lord Çiva. Lord Brahmä first met all the demigods, including Lord Çiva. Then, along with mother earth, they went to the shore of the ocean of milk, where Lord Viñëu lies on a white island, Çvetadvépa."
