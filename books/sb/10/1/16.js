    "translation": "The Ganges, emanating from the toe of Lord Viñëu, purifies the three worlds, the upper, middle and lower planetary systems. Similarly, when one asks questions about the pastimes and characteristics of Lord Väsudeva, Kåñëa, three varieties of men are purified: the speaker or preacher, he who inquires, and the people in general who listen.",

Those interested in understanding transcendental subject matters as the goal of life must approach the bona fide spiritual master. Tasmäd guruà prapadyeta. One must surrender to such a guru, who can give right information about Kåñëa. Herein, Mahäräja Parékñit has surrendered to the right personality, Çukadeva Gosvämé, for enlightenment in väsudeva-kathä. Väsudeva is the original Personality of Godhead, who has unlimited spiritual activities. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is a record of such activities, and Bhagavad-gétä is the record of Väsudeva speaking personally. Therefore, since the Kåñëa consciousness movement is full of väsudeva-kathä, anyone who hears, anyone who joins the movement and anyone who preaches will be purified."
