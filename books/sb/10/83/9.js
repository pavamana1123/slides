    "translation": "Çré Satyabhämä said: My father, his heart tormented by his brothers death, accused Kåñëa of killing him. To remove the stain on His reputation, the Lord defeated the king of the bears and took back the Syamantaka jewel, which He then returned to my father. Fearing the consequences of his offense, my father offered me to the Lord, even though I had already been promised to others.",

            "content": "As described in  of this canto, King Saträjit had already compromised himself by promising his daughter's hand first to Akrüra and then again to a number of other suitors. But after the return of the Syamantaka jewel, he felt impelled by his shame to offer her to Lord Kåñëa instead. According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the word prabhave (\"unto the Lord\") answers any doubt as to the propriety of offering Kåñëa a bride who had already been promised to others. It is perfectly proper to offer Him everything one owns, and improper to withhold anything from Him."
