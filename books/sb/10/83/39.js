In her humility Lakñmaëä claimed that Kåñëa's queens, unlike ordinary wives, could not bring their husband under control, and thus they could relate to Him only as servile housekeepers. In fact, however, since the Lord's queens are direct expansions of His internal pleasure potency (hlädiné-çakti), they fully controlled Him with their love."
