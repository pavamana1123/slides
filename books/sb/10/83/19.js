    "translation": "Just as a fish was used as a target in your svayaà-vara ceremony, O Queen, to assure that you would obtain Arjuna as your husband, so a fish was also used in my ceremony. In my case, however, it was concealed on all sides, and only its reflection could be seen in a pot of water below.",

Why, then, could he not hit the fish target at Çrématé Lakñmaëä's svayaà-vara ceremony just as he had done once before to win Draupadé? Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains: The target at Draupadé's svayaà-vara had been covered only partially, so that a marksman could see it if he looked straight up the pillar on which it was placed. To shoot Lakñmaëä's target, however, it was necessary to aim by looking up and down at the same time, an impossible feat for any mortal. Therefore only Kåñëa could strike the target."
