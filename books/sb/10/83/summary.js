Arjuna then made his attempt. He concentrated on the reflection of the fish in the water and took careful aim, but when he released his arrow it only grazed the target. Then Çré Kåñëa fixed His arrow on the bow and shot it straight through the target, knocking it to the ground. I placed the victory necklace on Çré Kåñëa's neck, but the kings who had failed raised a violent protest. Lord Kåñëa valiantly fought them, cutting off the heads, arms and legs of many and sending the rest fleeing for their lives. Then the Lord took me to Dvärakä for our lavish wedding.\""
