The gopés considered the sophisticated women of Dvärakä the most serious threat to their hold on Çré Kåñëa, confessing their anxiety to Uddhava: kasmät kåñëa ihäyäti präpta-räjyo hatähitaù/ narendra-kanyä udvähya."

            "content": "\"Why should Kåñëa come back here after winning a kingdom, killing His enemies and marrying the daughters of kings?\" Rukmiëé and her seven chief co-wives considered themselves so fortunate in their relationship with Kåñëa as He appeared in Dvärakä that they did not especially desire to see Him as He is in Våndävana. But the sixteen thousand lesser queens, after hearing Uddhava describe Çré Rädhä's superexcellent qualities, became attracted to touch the dust that falls from Kåñëa's feet onto the grass and plants of Våndävana. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté indicates that some commentators give this as the reason why, after the mauñala-lélä, these sixteen thousand queens were stolen from Arjuna on the road by Lord Kåñëa Himself in the disguise of sixteen thousand cowherds, who then took them away to Gokula."
