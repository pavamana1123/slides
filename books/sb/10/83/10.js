Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté mentions that while hearing Jämbavaté's story, the women present recognized her as the girl whom Jämbavän had once offered to Lord Çré Räma to be His wife. Since Lord Räma had taken a vow to have only one wife, He could not accept her then, but did so when He returned in the Dväpara-yuga as Kåñëa. The other queens wanted to honor Jämbavaté for this, but she replied humbly, \"I am just the Lord's maidservant.\""
