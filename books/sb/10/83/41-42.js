Viräö is explained by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté as representing the phrase vividhaà viräjate (\"one enjoys many kinds of opulence\") and specifically indicating the eight mystic perfections of aëimä and so on."

They simply want the dust from Çré Kåñëa's feet, which Goddess Çré herself worships. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté tells us that the goddess of fortune mentioned here is not Lakñmé, the consort of Näräyaëa. After all, the äcärya explains, Goddess Lakñmé could not attain the direct association of Kåñëa even after performing extended austerities, as Uddhava states: näyaà çréyo 'ìga u nitänta-rateù prasädaù . Rather, the Çré referred to here is the supreme goddess of fortune identified by the Båhad-gautaméya-tantra:"
