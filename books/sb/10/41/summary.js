Akrüra emerged from the water and in great amazement approached the Lord, who asked him whether he had seen something wonderful while bathing. Akrüra replied, \"Whatever wonderful things there are in the realms of water, earth or sky, all have their existence within You. Thus when one has seen You, nothing remains unseen.\" Akrüra then began driving the chariot again."

After meeting up with Nanda Mahäräja and the other cowherds, who had gone on ahead, Kåñëa asked Akrüra to return home, promising to visit him there after He had killed Kaàsa. Akrüra unhappily bid the Lord goodbye, went to King Kaàsa to inform him that Kåñëa and Balaräma had come, and went home."

As they all entered Mathurä, the women of the city eagerly came out of their houses to see Kåñëa. They had often heard about Him and had long since developed a deep attraction for Him. But now that they were actually seeing Him, they were overwhelmed with happiness, and all their distress due to His absence was eradicated."

Kåñëa asked him for some of the first-class garments he was carrying, but he refused and even chastised the two Lords. At this Kåñëa became very angry and beheaded the man with His fingertips. The washerman's assistants, seeing his untimely end, dropped their bundles of clothes on the spot and ran off in all directions. Kåñëa and Balaräma then took some of the garments They especially fancied."

Kåñëa and Balaräma then went to the house of the garland-maker Sudämä. Sudämä offered Them his full obeisances, worshiped Them by bathing Their feet and offering Them such items as arghya and sandalwood paste, and chanted prayers in Their honor. Then he adorned Them with garlands of fragrant flowers. Pleased, the Lords offered him whatever benedictions he wished, and then They moved on."
