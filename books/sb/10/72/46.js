Their purpose in killing Jaräsandha was to stop him from creating a disturbance against the proper discharge of world peace. A demon always creates disturbances, whereas a demigod always tries to keep peace in the world. The mission of Lord Kåñëa is to give protection to the righteous persons and to kill the demons who disturb a peaceful situation. Therefore Lord Kåñëa immediately called for the son of Jaräsandha, whose name was Sahadeva, and with due ritualistic ceremonies He asked him to occupy the seat of his father and reign over the kingdom peacefully. Lord Kåñëa is the master of the whole cosmic creation, and He wants everyone to live peacefully and execute Kåñëa consciousness. After installing Sahadeva on the throne, He released all the kings and princes who had been imprisoned unnecessarily by Jaräsandha.\""
