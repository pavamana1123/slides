The great devotee Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja implores Lord Kåñëa to demonstrate plainly the result of worshiping Him and the result of not worshiping Him. If the people of the world could understand this, they could begin to recognize that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that everyone's ultimate self-interest lies in surrendering to Him. As confirmed by great authorities, Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja is a pure devotee of the Lord, and thus his actual motivation in discharging his duties as a king was to establish the supremacy of Lord Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the real purport of the activities of the Päëòavas, which are described in both the Çrémad-Bhägavatam and the Mahäbhärata."
