In this sacrifice people uninterested in Your devotional service will be able to see firsthand the superiority of Your devotees and the inferiority of nondevotees. They will also be able to see Your lotus feet.\""

Indeed, all living beings should desire that this sacrifice be performed. To make this sacrifice possible, however, you must first defeat all the kings of the earth and collect all the necessary paraphernalia.\""

After they had conquered-or won the fealty of-the kings in their assigned directions, they brought back abundant wealth to Yudhiñöhira. They informed him, however, that Jaräsandha could not be defeated. As King Yudhiñöhira pondered how he could subdue Jaräsandha, Çré Kåñëa revealed to him the means for doing so, following the previous advice of Uddhava."

They introduced themselves as brähmaëas to King Jaräsandha, flattering him by praising his reputation for hospitality, and requested him to grant their desire. Seeing the marks of bowstrings on their limbs, Jaräsandha concluded that they were warriors and not brähmaëas, but still, even though fearful, he promised to fulfill whatever desire they might have. At that point Lord Kåñëa discarded His disguise and asked Jaräsandha to fight Him in one-to-one combat. But Jaräsandha refused, claiming that Kåñëa was a coward because He had once fled the battlefield. Jaräsandha also declined to fight Arjuna on the plea that he was inferior in age and size. But Bhéma he considered a worthy opponent."

Lord Kåñëa then split a small tree branch in half, thus showing Bhéma how to kill Jaräsandha. Bhéma threw Jaräsandha to the ground, stepped on one of his legs, seized the other with his arms and proceeded to tear him apart from his genitals to his head."
