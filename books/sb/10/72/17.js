He was a great fighter, a kñatriya king, but he was never neglectful of the Vedic injunctions. According to Vedic injunctions, the brähmaëas are considered to be the spiritual masters of all other castes. Lord Kåñëa, Arjuna and Bhémasena were actually kñatriyas, but they dressed themselves as brähmaëas, and at the time when King Jaräsandha was to give charity to the brähmaëas and receive them as guests, they approached him.\""
