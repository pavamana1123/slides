Thus the äcärya understands Jaräsandha's mind as follows: \"O weak ones, forget the botheration of fighting. Why not just accept my head? By dressing yourselves as brähmaëas begging charity, you have made your heroism set like the sun, but if somehow you have not lost your courage, I will give you battle.\""
