One who has not conquered his senses cannot conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the secret of devotional service."

The specific qualification of all the Päëòava brothers was that they always engaged their senses in the service of the Lord. One who thus engages his senses becomes purified, and with purified senses one can actually render service to the Lord. The Lord can thus be conquered by the devotee through loving transcendental service.\""
