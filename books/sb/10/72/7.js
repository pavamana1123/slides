The Lord further agrees that there is nothing unfair in the fact that one result is achieved by those who worship Him, and another by those who do not. The great Bhägavatam commentators point out that by addressing King Yudhiñöhira as çatru-karçana, \"tormentor of enemies,\" Lord Kåñëa is imparting to him the potency to conquer all the enemy kings. Thus Kåñëa predicted that King Yudhiñöhira's noble fame would spread to all the worlds, and in fact it has."
