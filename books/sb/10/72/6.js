    "translation": "Within Your mind there can be no such differentiation as \"This one is mine, and that is another's,\" because You are the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Soul of all beings, always equipoised and enjoying transcendental happiness within Yourself. Just like the heavenly desire tree, You bless all who properly worship You, granting their desired fruits in proportion to the service they render You. There is nothing wrong in this.",

Jéva Gosvämé Prabhupäda adds that a desire tree does not think, \"This person is fit to worship me, but that other person is not.\" Rather, a desire tree is satisfied with all who properly serve it. And the Lord acts in the same way, as explained here by King Yudhiñöhira."

            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté adds that no one should accuse Lord Kåñëa of being envious of one person and showing favoritism toward another. Since the Lord is sva-sukhänubhüti, experiencing His own happiness within Himself, He has nothing to gain or lose in relation to conditioned souls. Rather, He reciprocates according to how they approach Him. Çréla Prabhupäda very nicely sums up this point as follows in his rendering of King Yudhiñöhira's statement: \"If one takes to Kåñëa consciousness, his life becomes fulfilled both materially and spiritually. This does not mean that You are partial to the Kåñëa conscious person and indifferent to the non-Kåñëa conscious person. You are equal to everyone; that is Your declaration. You cannot be partial to one and not interested in others, because You are sitting in everyone's heart as the Supersoul and giving everyone the respective results of his fruitive activities. You give every living entity the chance to enjoy this material world as he desires. As the Supersoul, You are sitting in the body along with the living entity, giving him the results of his own actions as well as opportunities to turn toward Your devotional service by developing Kåñëa consciousness. You openly declare that one should surrender unto You, giving up all other engagements, and that You will take charge of him, giving him relief from the reactions of all sins. You are like the desire tree in the heavenly planets, which awards benediction according to one's desires. Everyone is free to achieve the highest perfection, but if one does not so desire, then Your awarding of lesser benedictions is not due to partiality.\""
