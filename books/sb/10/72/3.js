            "content": "Çréla Çrédhara Svämé states that the word vibhütéù refers to Lord Kåñëa's expansions (aàçän), and Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura further explains that here the word vibhütéù refers to Lord Kåñëa's opulent expansions within this world, such as the demigods and other empowered beings. Thus Çréla Prabhupäda treats this verse as follows in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead: \"My dear Lord Kåñëa, the sacrifice known as the Räjasüya yajïa is to be performed by the emperor, and it is considered to be the king of all sacrifices. By performing this sacrifice, I wish to satisfy all the demigods, who are Your empowered representatives within this material world, and I wish that You will kindly help me in this great adventure so that it may be successfully executed. As far as the Päëòavas are concerned, we have nothing to ask from the demigods. We are personally satisfied by being Your devotees. As you say in the Bhagavad-gétä, 'Persons who are bewildered by material desires worship the demigods,' but our purpose is different. I want to perform this Räjasüya sacrifice and invite the demigods to show them that they have no power independent of You. They are all Your servants, and You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons with a poor fund of knowledge consider Your Lordship an ordinary human being. Sometimes they try to find fault in You, and sometimes they defame You. Therefore I wish to perform the Räjasüya yajïa. I wish to invite all the demigods, beginning from Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and other exalted chiefs of the heavenly planets, and in that great assembly of the demigods from all parts of the universe, I want to substantiate that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that everyone is Your servant.\""
