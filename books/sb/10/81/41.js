He is especially inclined to the brähmaëa devotees. Lord Kåñëa is also called brahmaëya-deva, which means that He is worshiped by the brähmaëas. Therefore it is understood that a devotee who is fully surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead has already acquired the position of a brähmaëa. Without becoming a brähmaëa, one cannot approach the Supreme Brahman, Lord Kåñëa. Kåñëa is especially concerned with vanquishing the distress of His devotees, and He is the only shelter of pure devotees.\""
