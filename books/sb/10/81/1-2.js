According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté's further explanation of this verse, Lord Kåñëa smiled at this moment, thinking \"Yes, I am going to make you show what you brought for Me.\" His smile then turned to laughter as He thought, \"How long are you going to keep this precious gift hidden in your cloth?\""
