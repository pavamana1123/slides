    "translation": "Being the direct witness in the hearts of all living beings, Lord Kåñëa fully understood why Sudämä had come to see Him. Thus He thought, \"In the past My friend has never worshiped Me out of a desire for material opulence, but now he comes to Me to satisfy his chaste and devoted wife. I will give him riches that even the immortal demigods cannot obtain.\"",

The Supreme Lord does not force sense gratification upon the devotee who is extremely averse to worldly enjoyments. This is seen among such great renouncers as Jaòa Bharata. On the other hand, the Lord may give limitless wealth and power to a devotee who is neither repelled nor attracted by material things, such as Prahläda Mahäräja. Up to this point in his life, Sudämä Brähmaëa was totally averse to sense gratification, but now, out of compassion for his faithful wife—and also because he hankered to have Kåñëa's audience—he went to beg from the Lord."
