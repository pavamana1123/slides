    "translation": "[Çukadeva Gosvämé continued:] Thinking thus to himself, Sudämä finally came to the place where his home stood. But that place was now crowded on all sides with towering, celestial palaces rivaling the combined brilliance of the sun, fire and the moon. There were splendorous courtyards and gardens, each filled with flocks of cooing birds and beautified by ponds in which kumuda, ambhoja, kahlära and utpala lotuses grew. Finely attired men and doe-eyed women stood in attendance. Sudämä wondered, \"What is all this? Whose property is it? How has this all come about?\"",
