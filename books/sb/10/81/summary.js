I regard as very significant even the smallest offering from My loving devotee.\" But the poor brähmaëa was ashamed to present Kåñëa with his meager gift of flat rice. However, since Lord Kåñëa is the Supersoul dwelling in all hearts, He knew why Sudämä had come to visit Him. So He grabbed the bundle of flat rice Sudämä was hiding and ate a handful of it with great pleasure. He was about to eat a second morsel when Rukmiëé devé stopped Him."

As he passed along the highway, he thought of how fortunate he was to have been so honored by Çré Kåñëa. Absorbed in this meditation, Sudämä arrived at the place where his home used to be-and he was struck with great wonder. Instead of his broken-down hovel, he saw a series of opulent palaces. While he stood astonished, a group of beautiful men and women came forward to greet him with singing and music. The brähmaëa's wife, wonderfully adorned with celestial jewelry, came out of the palace and welcomed him with great love and reverence. Sudämä entered his home together with her, thinking that this extraordinary transformation must have been due to the Supreme Lord's mercy on him."
