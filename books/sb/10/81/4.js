The use of the words bhaktyä prayacchati and bhakty-upahåtam may seem redundant, since they both mean \"offered with devotion,\" but bhaktyä can indicate how the Lord reciprocates the devotional mood of whoever offers Him something with love. In other words, Lord Kåñëa here declares that His reciprocation in a pure loving exchange is not dependent on the external quality of what is offered. Kåñëa says, \"Something may or may not be impressive and pleasing in its own right, but when My devotee offers it to Me in devotion, with the expectation that I will enjoy it, it gives Me great pleasure; in this regard I make no discrimination.\" The verb açnämi, \"I eat,\" implies that Lord Kåñëa eats even a flower, which is supposed to be smelled, bewildered as He is by the ecstatic love He feels for His devotee."
