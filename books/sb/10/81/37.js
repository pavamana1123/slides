He reasoned that if he had any true devotion, the Lord would have granted him perfect, unflinching devotion rather than the material riches and servants he had received. Lord Kåñëa would have protected a more serious devotee by denying him such distractions. The Lord will give a sincere but less intelligent devotee not as much material wealth as he desires, but only what will promote his devotional progress. Sudämä thought, \"A great saint like Prahläda Mahäräja can avoid becoming contaminated by immeasurable wealth, power and fame, but I must always be wary of temptation in my new situation.\""
