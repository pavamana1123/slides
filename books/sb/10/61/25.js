Thus we find the following injunction: dviñad-annaà na bhoktavyaà dviñantaà naiva bhojayet. \"One should not eat an enemy's food or feed an enemy.\" There is also the following prohibition: asvargyaà loka-vidviñöaà dharmam apy äcaren na tu. \"One should not execute religious injunctions if they will obstruct one's journey to heaven, or if they are odious to human society.\""

Still, out of affection for his sister, he gave his granddaughter to Aniruddha."

As Lord Kåñëa states in the Gétä , sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaranaà vraja. The last word in spiritual duties is to surrender to the Supreme Lord, and that duty takes precedence over all secondary injunctions. Moreover, in this age Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has kindly presented a sublime process that will attract all sincere people to come to the point of surrendering to the Lord. By following Lord Caitanya's blissful process of chanting, dancing, feasting and discussing spiritual philosophy, anyone can easily go back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge."

            "content": "Still, someone may argue that the members of the Kåñëa consciousness movement should not practice in the Western countries those ceremonies or activities that displease people in general. We respond that even in the Western countries, when people are properly informed of the activities of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, they generally appreciate this great spiritual institution. Those who are especially envious of God will not appreciate any type of religious movement, and since such persons are themselves little better than animals, they cannot impede the great Kåñëa consciousness movement, just as the envious Rukmé could not impede the performance of Lord Kåñëa's pure pastimes."
