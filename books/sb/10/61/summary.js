They were all entranced by the Lord's beauty and His loving conversations with them, but they could not agitate His mind with the charming gestures of their eyebrows or by any other means. Having attained as their husband Lord Kåñëa, whom even demigods like Brahmä find it difficult to know in truth, the Lord's queens were always eager to associate with Him. Thus, although each of them had millions of maidservants, they would personally render Him menial service."

Though Çré Kåñëa had disrespected Rukmé, to please his sister Rukmé gave his daughter in marriage to Pradyumna, and his granddaughter to Aniruddha. Balé, the son of Kåtavarmä, married Rukmiëé's daughter Cärumaté."

After the ceremony, Rukmé challenged Lord Baladeva to a game of dice. In the first match Rukmé defeated Baladeva, whereupon the King of Kaliìga laughed at the Lord, displaying all his teeth. Lord Baladeva won the next match, but Rukmé refused to concede defeat. A voice then spoke from the sky, announcing that Baladeva had in fact won. But Rukmé, encouraged by the wicked kings, offended Lord Baladeva by saying that while He was certainly expert at tending cows, He knew nothing of playing dice. Thus insulted, Lord Baladeva angrily struck Rukmé dead with His club. The King of Kaliìga tried to flee, but Lord Baladeva seized him and knocked out all his teeth. Then the other offensive kings, their arms, thighs and heads wounded by Baladeva's blows, fled in all directions, bleeding profusely. Çré Kåñëa expressed neither approval nor disapproval of His brother-in-law's death, fearing He would jeopardize His loving ties with either Rukmiëé or Baladeva."
