            "content": "The words puruñaà präkåtaà matvä, \"thinking Him a mundane person,\" are very significant. So-called Vedic scholars, including most Western ones, enjoy translating the word puruñam as \"man\" even when the word refers to Lord Kåñëa, and thus their unauthorized translations of Vedic literature are tainted by their materialistic conceptions of the Godhead. However, here it is clearly stated that it was because Jämbavän misunderstood the Lord's position that he considered Him präkåta-puruña, \"a mundane person.\" In other words, the Lord is actually puruñottama, \"the ultimate transcendental person.\""
