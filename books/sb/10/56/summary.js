After fastening the gem to a chain, which he then hung around his neck, Saträjit traveled to Dvärakä. The residents, thinking he was the sun-god himself, went to Kåñëa and told Him that Lord Sürya had come to take His audience. But Kåñëa replied that the man who had come was not Sürya but King Saträjit, who looked extremely effulgent because he was wearing the Syamantaka jewel."

Shortly thereafter Saträjit's brother Prasena left the city to hunt on horseback, wearing the Syamantaka jewel on his neck. On the road a lion killed Prasena and took the jewel away to a mountain cave, where the king of the bears, Jämbavän, happened to be living. Jämbavän killed the lion and gave the jewel to his son to play with."

Lord Kåñëa heard about this rumor circulating among the general populace, and to clear His name He went with some of the citizens to find Prasena. Following his path, they eventually found his body and that of his horse lying on the road. Further on they saw the body of the lion Jämbavän had killed. Lord Kåñëa told the citizens to remain outside the cave while He went in to investigate."

But when Kåñëa tried to take the jewel, the child's nurse cried out in alarm, bringing Jämbavän quickly to the scene. Jämbavän considered Kåñëa an ordinary man and began fighting with Him. For twenty-eight days continuously the two fought, until finally Jämbavän grew weak from the Lord's blows. Now understanding that Kåñëa was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Jämbavän began to praise Him. The Lord touched Jämbavän with His lotus hand, dispelling his fear, and then explained everything about the jewel. With great devotion Jämbavän gladly presented the Syamantaka jewel to the Lord, together with his unmarried daughter, Jämbavaté."

All of Kåñëa's friends and family members became extremely sorrowful and began regularly worshiping Goddess Durgä to assure the Lord's safe return. Even as they performed this worship, Lord Kåñëa entered the city in the company of His new wife. He summoned Saträjit to the royal assembly and, after recounting to him the entire story of the Syamantaka jewel's recovery, gave the jewel back to him. Saträjit accepted the jewel, but with great shame and remorse. He went back to his home, and there he decided to offer Lord Kåñëa not only the jewel but also his daughter so as to atone for the offense he had committed against the Lord's lotus feet. Çré Kåñëa accepted the hand of Saträjit's daughter, Satyabhämä, who was endowed with all divine qualities. But the jewel He refused, returning it to King Saträjit."
