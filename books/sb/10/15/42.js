    "translation": "Lord Kåñëa's hair, powdered with the dust raised by the cows, was decorated with a peacock feather and forest flowers. The Lord glanced charmingly and smiled beautifully, playing upon His flute while His companions chanted His glories. The gopés, all together, came forward to meet Him, their eyes very eager to see Him.",

But Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all living beings are His eternal servants. Thus the gopés, although the most pure-hearted of all great souls, did not hesitate to come forward and satisfy their love-struck eyes by drinking in the sight of beautiful young Kåñëa. The gopés also relished the sweet sound of His flute and the enchanting fragrance of His body."
