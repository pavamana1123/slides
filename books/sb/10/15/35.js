In this connection Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that the Supreme Lord possesses unlimited potency and strength, as expressed here by the word anante. The Lord exhibits a tiny fraction of His power according to the need of a particular situation. Lord Balaräma desired to vanquish the gang of demoniac asses who had unlawfully seized the Tälavana forest, and therefore He exhibited just enough divine opulence to easily kill Dhenukäsura and the other demons."
