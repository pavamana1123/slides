    "translation": "With their beelike eyes, the women of Våndävana drank the honey of the beautiful face of Lord Mukunda, and thus they gave up the distress they had felt during the day because of separation from Him. The young Våndävana ladies cast sidelong glances at the Lord—glances filled with bashfulness, laughter and submission—and Çré Kåñëa, completely accepting these glances as a proper offering of respect, entered the cowherd village.",

All day they were thinking of Kåñëa in the forest or of Him herding cows in the pasture. When they saw Kåñëa returning, all their anxieties were immediately relieved, and they began to look at His face the way drones hover over the honey of the lotus flower. When Kåñëa entered the village, the young gopés smiled and laughed. Kåñëa, while playing the flute, enjoyed the beautiful smiling faces of the gopés.\""

When a chaste young girl is in love, she glances at her beloved with shyness, jubilation and submission. When the beloved accepts her offering of love by receiving her glance and is thus satisfied with her, the loving young girl's heart becomes filled with happiness. These were exactly the romantic exchanges taking place between beautiful young Kåñëa and the loving cowherd girls of Våndävana."
