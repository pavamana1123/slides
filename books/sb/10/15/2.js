Since the spring season is also known as Mädhava, it is understood that as soon as Lord Kåñëa entered the Våndävana forest, it automatically exhibited all the opulences of spring, becoming filled with flowers, breezes and a celestial atmosphere. Another reason Lord Kåñëa is known as Mädhava is that He enjoys His pastimes in madhu, the taste of conjugal love."

These simple pastimes of playfully entering the forest, playing on the flute and so forth were performed daily in the spiritual land of Våndävana."
