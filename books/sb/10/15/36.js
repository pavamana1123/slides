One reason for this is that the demons, having seen the prowess of Lord Balaräma, thought it wise to attack Kåñëa first. Or it may be that out of affection for His elder brother, Lord Kåñëa placed Himself between Balaräma and the ass demons. The words kåñëaà ca rämaà ca may also be understood to indicate that Lord Balaräma, out of affection for His younger brother, went to Lord Kåñëa's side."
