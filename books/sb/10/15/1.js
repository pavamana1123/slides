Therefore the Lord decided to bring them into the palm-tree forest called Tälavana, where there were many delicious ripe fruits. Since Lord Kåñëa's spiritual body had apparently grown slightly in age and strength, the senior men of Våndävana, headed by Nanda Mahäräja, decided to promote Kåñëa from the task of herding calves to the status of a regular cowherd boy. He would now take care of the full-grown cows, bulls and oxen. Out of great affection, Nanda Mahäräja had previously considered Kåñëa too small and immature to take care of full-grown cows and bulls. It is stated in the Kärttika-mähätmya section of the Padma Puräëa:"
