    "translation": "This earth has now become most fortunate, because You have touched her grass and bushes with Your feet and her trees and creepers with Your fingernails, and because You have graced her rivers, mountains, birds and animals with Your merciful glances. But above all, You have embraced the young cowherd women between Your two arms-a favor hankered after by the goddess of fortune herself.",

            "content": "The word adya, \"now,\" indicates the time of Lord Balaräma and Lord Kåñëa's appearance on the earth. In His form of Varäha, Lord Kåñëa personally saved the earth, and, indeed, the earth is understood to rest perpetually on the potency of Çeña. Both Varäha and Çeña are expansions of Balaräma, who is Himself an expansion of Lord Kåñëa, the original Personality of Godhead. Lord Kåñëa's statement that \"this earth has now become most fortunate\" (dhanyeyam adya dharaëé) indicates that nothing can equal the blessings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His personal form as Kåñëa, appearing simultaneously with His plenary expansion, Balaräma. The compound word karajäbhimåñöäù, \"touched by Your fingernails,\" indicates that as Kåñëa and Balaräma would move through the forest They would pick fruits and flowers from the trees, bushes and creepers and use this paraphernalia in Their pleasure pastimes. Sometimes They would break leaves off the plants and use them with the flowers to decorate Their bodies."

            "content": "Kåñëa and Balaräma would glance lovingly and mercifully at all the rivers, hills and creatures in Våndävana. But the blessing received by the gopés—being embraced directly between the Lord's arms—was the supreme benediction, desired even by the goddess of fortune herself. The goddess of fortune, who lives in Vaikuëöha on the chest of Lord Näräyaëa, once desired to be embraced on the chest of Çré Kåñëa, and thus she performed severe austerities to achieve this blessing. Çré Kåñëa informed her that her actual place was in Vaikuëöha and that it was not possible for her to dwell upon His chest in Våndävana. Therefore she begged Kåñëa to allow her to remain on His chest in the form of a golden line, and He granted her this benediction. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura recounts this incident from the Puräëas."
