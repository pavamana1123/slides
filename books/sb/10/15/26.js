Lord Kåñëa's cowherd boyfriends are exalted, self-realized souls who would not ordinarily become greedy for sweet fruits. In fact, they are simply joking with the Lord and enthusing His pastimes, urging Him to perform unprecedented heroic feats in the Täla forest. Innumerable demons disturbed the sublime atmosphere of Våndävana during Lord Kåñëa's presence there, and the Lord would kill such demons as a popular daily event."

By the words yadi rocate, the cowherd boys indicate that Lord Kåñëa and Lord Balaräma need not kill the demon simply to satisfy them; rather, They should do so only if the Lords Themselves found the concept appealing."
