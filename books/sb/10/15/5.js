In fact, all the creatures of Våndävana, including the trees and cows, were great souls who could personally associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But because of ecstatic sentiments of separation, the trees considered themselves in ignorance and thus tried to purify themselves by bowing down at the lotus feet of Kåñëa and Balaräma. Lord Kåñëa understanding their mentality, simultaneously glanced at them with affection and praised their devotional service before His older brother, Balaräma."
