    "translation": "The minds of those gopés are always absorbed in Me, and their very lives are ever devoted to Me. For My sake they have abandoned everything related to their bodies, renouncing ordinary happiness in this life, as well as religious duties necessary for such happiness in the next life. I alone am their dearmost beloved and, indeed, their very Self. I personally sustain such devotees, who for My sake give up all worldly duties.",

According to the Vaiñëava äcäryas, the word daihikäù, \"related to the body,\" refers to husbands, children, homes and so on. The gopés loved Kåñëa so intensely that they could think of nothing else. Since Çré Kåñëa maintains ordinary devotees engaged in sädhana-bhakti, devotional service in practice, He will certainly maintain the gopés, His most exalted devotees."
