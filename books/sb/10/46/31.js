            "content": "The word vilakñaëa means either \"distinctly perceiving\" or \"confused,\" depending on how the prefix vi—is understood in context. In the case of enlightened souls, vilakñaëa means \"perceiving the correct distinction between the body and the soul\" and thus Lord Kåñëa, as indicated by the word éçäte, guides the spiritually advancing soul. The other meaning of vilakñaëa—\"confused\" or \"bewildered\"—clearly applies to those who have not understood the difference between the soul and the body, or the distinction between the individual soul and the Supreme Soul. Such bewildered living beings do not go back home, back to Godhead, to the eternal spiritual world, but rather achieve temporary destinations according to the laws of nature."

            "content": "It is understood from all Vaiñëava literature that Çré Räma, Balaräma, here accompanying Lord Kåñëa, is nondifferent from Him, being His plenary expansion. The Lord is one, yet He expands Himself, and thus Lord Balaräma in no way compromises the principle of monotheism."
