Rather, their husbands merely presumed, \"These are our wives.\" In other words, by Lord Kåñëa's spiritual potency, the gopés existed entirely for His pleasure, and Kåñëa loved them in the mood of a paramour. In fact, the gopés were manifestations of Kåñëa's internal nature, His supreme pleasure potency, and on the spiritual platform they attracted the Lord by their pure love."
