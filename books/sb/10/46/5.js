Thus things in a favorable relationship to our self also become dear to us, and we try to possess them. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, among countless millions of such dear things, Çré Kåñëa is the most dear of all, even dearer than one's own self. The gopés had realized this fact, and thus they were stunned in separation from the Lord because of their intense love for Him. Although they would have given up their lives, they were kept alive by the Lord's transcendental potency."
