The Lord had promised the residents of Våndävana: äyäsye, \"I shall return.\"  At the same time, the Lord could not break His promise to Çré Vasudeva and mother Devaké to finally spend some time with them after they had suffered for so many years. Therefore, the Lord decided to send His intimate representative to Våndävana in His place."

According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, for the Lord to have exchanged loving feelings with Nanda and Yaçodä in the same place and at the same time that He was exchanging them with Vasudeva and Devaké would have created an awkward situation in the Lord's pastimes. Thus Kåñëa did not invite Nanda and Yaçodä to stay with Him in Mathurä. The residents of Våndävana had their own way of understanding Kåñëa, and their feelings could not have been appropriately expressed on a regular basis in the kingly atmosphere of Mathurä."

Then, upon his return to Mathurä, Uddhava would describe to all the members of the Våñëi dynasty the extraordinary pure love he had seen in Våndävana. Indeed, the love the cowherd men and gopés felt for Kåñëa was far beyond anything the Lord's other devotees had ever experienced, and by hearing about that love all the Lord's devotees would increase their faith and devotion."

In fact, Çré Hari-vaàça states that Uddhava is the son of Vasudeva's brother Devabhäga: uddhavo devabhägasya mahä-bhägaù suto 'bhavat. In other words, he is a cousin-brother of Çré Kåñëa's."
