He maintained himself and his wife with whatever came of its own accord, and thus they were poverty-stricken. One day Sudämä's wife, unable to find any food to prepare for her husband, went to him and asked that he visit his friend Kåñëa in Dvärakä and beg some charity. Sudämä was reluctant, but when she persisted he agreed to go, reflecting that an opportunity to see the Lord was extremely auspicious. His wife begged a few handfuls of flattened rice as a gift for Çré Kåñëa, and Sudämä set off for Dvärakä."

Kåñëa immediately rose from His seat on Rukmiëé's bed and embraced His friend with great joy. Then He sat Sudämä down on the bed, washed his feet with His own hands and sprinkled the wash water on His head. After this He presented him with various gifts and worshiped him with incense, lamps and so on. Meanwhile, Rukmiëé fanned the shabbily dressed brähmaëa with a yaktail whisk. All of this astonished the residents of the palace."

Sudämä pointed out that Kåñëa engages in the pastime of acquiring an education only to set an example for human society."
