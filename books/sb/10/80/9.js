If the brähmaëa might say, \"How could the husband of the goddess of fortune befriend a fallen soul like myself?\" she replies by saying that Lord Kåñëa is brahmaëya, very favorably disposed toward the brähmaëas. If Sudämä might claim to have no real devotion for the Lord, she replies by saying that he is a great and wise personality who would surely obtain the shelter and mercy of the Lord. If the brähmaëa might object that Lord Kåñëa is equally disposed to all the countless unhappy conditioned souls suffering the fruits of their own karma, she replies that Lord Kåñëa is especially the Lord of the devotees, and thus even if He Himself did not grant Sudämä His mercy, certainly the devotees engaged in serving the Lord would mercifully give him some charity. Since the Lord protects the Sätvatas, the members of the Yadu dynasty, what difficulty would there be for Him to protect a humble brähmaëa like Sudämä, and what fault would there be in His doing so?"
