    "translation": "My dear friend, he who gives a person his physical birth is his first spiritual master, and he who initiates him as a twice-born brähmaëa and engages him in religious duties is indeed more directly his spiritual master. But the person who bestows transcendental knowledge upon the members of all the spiritual orders of society is one's ultimate spiritual master. Indeed, he is as good as My own self.",
