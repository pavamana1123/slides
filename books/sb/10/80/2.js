The äcärya replies that the word viçeña-jïa is therefore significant here. Those who have actually understood the essence of life do not give up Kåñëa consciousness. A further qualification is to be viñaëëaù käma-märgaëaiù, disgusted with material sense gratification. These two qualities are complementary. One who has experienced the real taste of Kåñëa consciousness automatically becomes disgusted with the inferior taste of material pleasure. Such a genuine hearer of the topics of Kåñëa cannot give up hearing about the Lord's fascinating pastimes."
