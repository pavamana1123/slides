He then entered one of the opulent palaces belonging to Lord Hari's sixteen thousand queens, and when he did so he felt as if he were attaining the bliss of liberation.",

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté quotes from the Padma Puräëa, Uttara-khaëòa, wherein we learn that the brähmaëa actually entered the palace of Rukmiëé: sa tu rukmiëy-antaù-pura-dväri kñaëaà tüñëéà sthitaù. \"He stood for a moment in silence at the doorway of Queen Rukmiëé's palace.\""
