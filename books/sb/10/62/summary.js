Bäëäsura once satisfied Çiva by playing musical instruments with his one thousand hands while Çiva danced his täëòava-nåtya. In response, Çiva offered Bäëa whatever benediction he chose, and Bäëa asked Çiva to become the guardian of his city."

Therefore these thousand arms you've given me are merely a heavy burden.\" Angered by these words, Lord Çiva replied, \"Your pride will be crushed in battle when you meet my equal. Indeed, your chariot flag will fall to the ground, broken.\""

She suddenly awoke, speaking aloud to Him in a state of agitation, but when she noticed her maidservants around her, she felt embarrassed. Üñä's companion Citralekhä asked her who she had been addressing, and Üñä told her everything. Hearing of Üñä's dreamlover, Citralekhä tried to relieve her friend's distress by drawing pictures of Gandharvas and other celestial personalities, as well as various men of the Våñëi dynasty. Citralekhä asked Üñä to pick out the man she had seen in her dreams, and Üñä pointed to the picture of Aniruddha. Citralekhä, who had mystic powers, knew at once that the young man her friend had pointed out was Lord Kåñëa's grandson Aniruddha. Then, using her mystic powers, Citralekhä flew through the sky to Dvärakä, found Aniruddha and brought Him back with her to Çoëitapura, Bäëäsura's capital. There she presented Him to Üñä."

After some time the female guards of the inner palace noticed symptoms of sexual activity on Üñä's person, and they went to Bäëäsura to inform him. Greatly disturbed, Bäëäsura rushed to his daughter's apartments with many armed guards and, to his great surprise, saw Aniruddha there. As the guards attacked Him, Aniruddha took up His club and succeeded in killing a few before the powerful Bäëa could capture Him with his mystic näga-päça ropes, filling Üñä with lamentation."
