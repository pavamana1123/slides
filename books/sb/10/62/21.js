As explained in the Hari-vaàça and other literatures, she needed to employ her powers because when she arrived at Dvärakä she found herself unable to enter Lord Kåñëa's city. At that time Çré Närada Muni instructed her in the mystic art of entering. Some authorities also say that Citralekhä is herself an expansion of Yogamäyä.\""
