    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: Bäëa was the oldest of the hundred sons fathered by the great saint Bali Mahäräja, who gave the whole earth in charity to Lord Hari when He appeared as Vämanadeva. Bäëäsura, born from Bali's semen, became a great devotee of Lord Çiva. His behavior was always respectable, and he was generous, intelligent, truthful and firm in his vows. The beautiful city of Çoëitapura was under his dominion. Because Lord Çiva had favored him, the very demigods waited on Bäëäsura like menial servants. Once, when Çiva was dancing his täëòava-nåtya, Bäëa especially satisfied the lord by playing a musical accompaniment with his one thousand arms.",
