This demon was so arrogant that he was convinced no one could defeat him. He was delighted to hear that someone as powerful as Lord Çiva would come to fight with him and satisfy his itching for battle. Even though Çiva had said that this person would break Bäëa's flag and destroy his prowess, the demon was too foolish to take this statement seriously and eagerly awaited the fight."

Although it is clear that death, both individual and collective, is quickly approaching them, modern sense gratifiers are oblivious to their inevitable destruction. As stated in the Bhägavatam , paçyann api na paçyati: Even though their imminent destruction is apparent, they are too blind to see it, being intoxicated by sex enjoyment and family attachment. Similarly, Bäëäsura was intoxicated with his material prowess and could not believe that he was about to be cut down to size."
