As conscious souls, we have a connection with the Supreme Soul through bhakti, or devotion. Through that relationship we experience perfect knowledge of the Supreme Soul. Since the Supreme Soul is the Absolute Truth, perfect knowledge of Him means perfect knowledge of everything. As stated in the Muëòaka Upaniñad (1.3), yasmin vijïäte sarvam evam vijïätaà bhavati: When the Absolute is understood, everything is understood. Thus Lord Kåñëa Himself, by His spiritual potency, establishes our connection with Him, and that connection is the source of all spiritual knowledge. Thus Äcärya Çrédhara, by his thoughtful translation, stimulates us to deeper understanding of Kåñëa conscious philosophy."
