Those who know the story of the Mahäbhärata will realize how relevant and prophetic these instructions are, and how much Dhåtaräñöra suffered for not accepting them. Although one tenaciously clings to his property, in the end all is lost, and the blundering soul is swept away by the wheel of birth and death."
