With tearful eyes, Kuntédevé asked Akrüra, \"Do my parents and other relatives, headed by Kåñëa and Balaräma, ever think of me and my sons, and will Kåñëa ever come to console us in our distress?\" Then Kuntédevé began to chant Lord Kåñëa's names for her protection, and she also chanted mantras expressing surrender to Him. Akrüra assured Kuntédevé, \"Since your sons were born from demigods like Dharma and Väyu, there is no reason to expect that any misfortune will befall them; rather, you should be confident that very soon they will receive the greatest possible good fortune.\""

Seeing all equally, which is the religious duty of kings, you should protect all your subjects and personal relations. By such fair behavior you will gain all fame and good fortune. But if you act otherwise, you will attain only infamy in this life and condemnation to a hellish existence in the next. A living being takes his birth all alone, and alone he gives up his life. Alone he enjoys the fruits of his piety and sin. If one fails to understand the true identity of the self and instead maintains his progeny by indulging in evil deeds, then surely he will go to hell. One should therefore learn to understand the unsteadiness of material existence, which is like a sleeper's dream, a magician's illusion or a flight of fancy, and should thus control his mind in order to remain peaceful and equipoised. \""

But because the tight knot of affection for my sons has made me biased toward them, your statements cannot become fixed within my mind. No one can transgress the arrangement of the Supreme Lord; His purpose for descending into the Yadu dynasty will inevitably be fulfilled.\""
