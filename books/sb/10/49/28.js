In fact, events have been set in motion by his attachment and sinful propensities, and therefore he should have taken responsibility for his own acts. Lord Kåñëa clearly states in the Bhagavad-gétä , nädatte kasyacit päpam: \"The Supreme Lord does not accept responsibility for anyone's sinful activities.\" It is a dangerous policy to claim that we are acting improperly because of \"destiny\" or \"fate.\" We should take up Kåñëa consciousness seriously and create an auspicious future for ourselves and our associates."

            "content": "Finally, one may argue that, after all, Dhåtaräñöra is involved in the Lord's pastimes and is actually His eternal associate. In answer to this we may say that the Lord's pastimes are not only entertaining but also didactic, and the lesson here is that Dhåtaräñöra should have acted properly. This is what the Lord wanted to teach. Dhåtaräñöra claims that Kåñëa came to relieve the burden of the earth, but the earth's burden is precisely the improper behavior of its inhabitants. So, let us take the lesson the Lord wants to teach here and be instructed for our benefit."
