    "translation": "My dear King Parékñit, Lord Kåñëa's wonderful, powerful dancing trampled and broke all of Käliya's one thousand hoods. Then the serpent, profusely vomiting blood from his mouths, finally recognized Çré Kåñëa to be the eternal Personality of Godhead, the supreme master of all moving and nonmoving beings, Çré Näräyaëa. Thus within his mind Käliya took shelter of the Lord.",

            "content": "In  of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda points out that whereas previously Käliya was vomiting poison, now his poison was exhausted and he began to vomit blood. Thus he had been cleansed of the vile contamination within his heart that had manifested as serpent's venom. The word småtvä, \"remembering,\" is very significant here. The wives of Käliya were actually serious devotees of Lord Kåñëa, and according to the äcäryas they had often tried to convince their husband to surrender to Him. Finally, finding himself in unbearable agony, Käliya remembered his wives' advice and took shelter of the Lord. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that Käliya's archrival had traditionally been Garuòa, the carrier of Viñëu. But now Käliya realized that he was fighting an opponent who was thousands of times stronger than Garuòa and who therefore could be only the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Käliya took shelter of Lord Kåñëa."
