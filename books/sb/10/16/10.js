    "translation": "When the members of the cowherd community, who had accepted Kåñëa as their dearmost friend, saw Him enveloped in the snake's coils, motionless, they were greatly disturbed. They had offered Kåñëa everything—their very selves, their families, their wealth, wives and all pleasures. At the sight of the Lord in the clutches of the Käliya snake, their intelligence became deranged by grief, lamentation and fear, and thus they fell to the ground.",
