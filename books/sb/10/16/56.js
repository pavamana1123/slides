            "content": "Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé points out that because of his wretched condition, Käliya was unable to compose original prayers to the Lord, and thus he paraphrased some of the prayers offered by his wives. The word asad-graha indicates that a conditioned soul seizes upon impermanent and impure things such as his own body, the bodies of others, and other countless varieties of material sense objects. The ultimate result of such material attachment is frustration, disappointment and anguish—a fact that has now become crystal clear to the poor serpent Käliya."
