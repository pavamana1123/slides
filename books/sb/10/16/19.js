They could not understand anything about the situation, and Kåñëa's cowherd boyfriends, being unconscious, were unable to tell them anything. The cows and calves were crying out for Kåñëa, and thus the whole situation was overwhelming and created a state of shock and panic among the residents of Våndävana."
