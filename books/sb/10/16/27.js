Dancing becomes more enjoyable and beautiful to watch when it is accompanied by expert drum-playing, singing and the chanting of prayers. The artistic atmosphere was also enhanced by the showering of a multitude of flowers upon Lord Çré Kåñëa, who was blissfully engaged in dancing upon the hoods of the Käliya serpent."
