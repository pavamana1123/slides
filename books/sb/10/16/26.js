    "translation": "Having severely depleted the serpent's strength with His relentless circling, Çré Kåñëa, the origin of everything, pushed down Käliya's raised shoulders and mounted his broad serpentine heads. Thus Lord Çré Kåñëa, the original master of all fine arts, began to dance, His lotus feet deeply reddened by the touch of the numerous jewels upon the serpent's heads.",

In the contaminated state called material consciousness, we conditioned souls become proud of our insignificant position and are thus reluctant to bow our heads before the Lord. Yet just as Lord Kåñëa forcibly pushed Käliya's heads down and thus defeated him, the Supreme Lord's energy in the form of irresistible time kills all conditioned souls and thus forces them to bow down their arrogant heads. We should therefore give up the artificial position of material life and become faithful servants of the Supreme Lord, enthusiastically bowing down at His lotus feet."

Lord Kåñëa, with those glowing reddish feet, then began to demonstrate His artistic skill by dancing on the unsteady, moving surface of the serpent's hoods. This extraordinary demonstration of dancing skill was meant for the pleasure of the young women of Våndävana, who at this phase of their relationship with Kåñëa were seriously falling in love with Him."
