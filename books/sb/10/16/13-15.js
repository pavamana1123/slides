    "translation": "Seeing the inauspicious omens, Nanda Mahäräja and the other cowherd men were fearful, for they knew that Kåñëa had gone to herd the cows that day without His elder brother, Balaräma. Because they had dedicated their minds to Kåñëa, accepting Him as their very life, they were unaware of His great power and opulence. Thus they concluded that the inauspicious omens indicated He had met with death, and they were overwhelmed with grief, lamentation and fear. All the inhabitants of Våndävana, including the children, women and elderly persons, thought of Kåñëa just as a cow thinks of her helpless young calf, and thus these poor, suffering people rushed out of the village, intent upon finding Him.",
