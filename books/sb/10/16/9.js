    "translation": "Käliya saw that Çré Kåñëa, who wore yellow silken garments, was very delicate, His attractive body shining like a glowing white cloud, His chest bearing the mark of Çrévatsa, His face smiling beautifully and His feet resembling the whorl of a lotus flower. The Lord was playing fearlessly in the water. Despite His wonderful appearance, the envious Käliya furiously bit Him on the chest and then completely enwrapped Him in his coils.",
