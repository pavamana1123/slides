    "translation": "Käliya worshiped the Lord of the universe by offering Him fine garments, along with necklaces, jewels and other valuable ornaments, wonderful scents and ointments, and a large garland of lotus flowers. Having thus pleased the Lord, whose flag is marked with the emblem of Garuòa, Käliya felt satisfied. Receiving the Lord's permission to leave, Käliya circumambulated Him and offered Him obeisances. Then, taking his wives, friends and children, he went to his island in the sea. The very moment Käliya left, the Yamunä was immediately restored to her original condition, free from poison and full of nectarean water. This happened by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was manifesting a humanlike form to enjoy His pastimes.",

            "content": "\"The Lord had made His Kaustubha gem enter the serpent's lake, and then He arranged for it to be presented to Himself by the hands of Käliya's wives.\" In other words, because Lord Kåñëa wanted to act just like an ordinary human being, He made the transcendental Kaustubha gem invisible and caused it to enter within Käliya's treasury. Then when the appropriate moment came for Käliya to worship the Lord with many different jewels and ornaments, the serpent's wives, unaware of the Lord's transcendental trick, presented Him with the Kaustubha gem, thinking it was simply one of the jewels in their possession."

            "type": "normal",
            "content": "The äcärya has further commented that the reason Lord Kåñëa is described in this verse as garuòa-dhvaja, \"He whose flag is marked by the symbol of His carrier, Garuòa,\" is that Käliya also desired to become Lord Kåñëa's carrier. Garuòa and the serpents are originally related as brothers, and therefore Käliya wanted to indicate to Lord Kåñëa, \"If You ever have to go to a distant place, You should also think of me as Your personal carrier. I am the servant of Your servant, and in the wink of an eye I can travel hundreds of millions of yojanas.\" Thus the Puräëas narrate that in the course of Lord Kåñëa's eternal cycle of pastimes, when Kaàsa orders the Lord to come to Mathurä, He sometimes goes there mounted upon Käliya."
