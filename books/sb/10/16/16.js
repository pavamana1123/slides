According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Balaräma was laughing because He thought, \"Kåñëa never cares to play with Me in My form of Çeña Näga, but now He is playing with this ordinary, mundane snake named Käliya.\""

            "content": "The question may arise as to why Kåñëa and Balaräma allowed Their loving devotees to suffer such great anguish during Kåñëa's temporary imprisonment within the coils of Käliya. It must be remembered that because the inhabitants of Våndävana were completely liberated souls, they did not experience material emotions. When they saw their beloved Kåñëa in apparent danger, their love for Him intensified to the highest degree, and thus they merged completely into the ecstasy of love for Him. The whole situation has to be seen from the spiritual point of view, or it will not be seen at all."
