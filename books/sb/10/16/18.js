Why hadn't His footprints been obliterated by those of the beasts and birds of Våndävana forest? The answer is indicated by the word viç-pati, master of the cowherd community. Since Lord Kåñëa is actually the wealth of all living beings, all the inhabitants of the forest of Vraja would carefully preserve His footprints as great treasures, the very ornaments of the earth. Thus no creature within Våndävana would ever walk upon Lord Kåñëa's footprints.\""
