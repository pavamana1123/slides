    "translation": "My dear King, Käliya had 101 prominent heads, and when one of them would not bow down, Lord Çré Kåñëa, who inflicts punishment on cruel wrong-doers, would smash that stubborn head by striking it with His feet. Then, as Käliya entered his death throes, he began wheeling his heads around and vomiting ghastly blood from his mouths and nostrils. The serpent thus experienced extreme pain and misery.",
