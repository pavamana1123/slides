Then He began fearlessly playing within the water like a maddened elephant. Käliya could not tolerate Kåñëa's trespassing upon his personal residence, and the serpent quickly went up to the Lord and bit Him on the chest. When Kåñëa's friends saw this, they fell down on the ground unconscious. At that time all sorts of evil omens appeared in Vraja, such as earth tremors, falling stars and the trembling of various creatures' left limbs."

Within the water of the lake adjoining the river they saw Lord Kåñëa, the very essence of their lives, enwrapped in the coils of a black snake. The residents thought the three worlds had become empty, and they all prepared to enter the water. But Lord Balaräma checked them, knowing well the power of Kåñëa."

Next the Lord began playfully dancing about on the serpent's hoods. By this wonderful, boisterous dancing, Çré Kåñëa trampled the serpent's one thousand hoods until his body slackened. Vomiting blood from his mouths, Käliya finally understood that Kåñëa was the primeval personality, Lord Näräyaëa, the spiritual master of all moving and nonmoving creatures, and he took shelter of Him."

Then they offered Him various prayers in hopes of gaining their husband's freedom: \"It is quite fitting that You have brought our cruel husband to this condition. Indeed, by Your anger he has gained great benefit. What piety Käliya must have amassed in his previous lives! Today he has borne upon his head the dust of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, the attainment of which is difficult for even the mother of the universe, goddess Lakñmé. Please kindly forgive the offense Käliya has committed out of ignorance, and allow him to live.\""

Then Käliya, in a distressed voice, acknowledged the offense he had committed, and finally he offered Kåñëa many prayers and said he was ready to accept His command. Kåñëa told him to leave the Yamunä lake with his family and return to Ramaëaka Island."
