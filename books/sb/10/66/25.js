When they found out that there were earrings on it, they could understand that it was someone's head. They conjectured as to whose head it might be. Some thought it was Kåñëa's head because Kåñëa was the enemy of Käçiräja, and they calculated that the King of Käçé might have thrown Kåñëa's head into the city so that the people might take pleasure in the enemy's having been killed. But it was finally detected that the head was not Kåñëa's but that of Käçiräja himself. \""
