After enjoying the loud laughter of all the members of the assembly, Kåñëa replied to the messenger as follows: 'O messenger of Pauëòraka, you may carry My message to your master. He is a foolish rascal. I directly call him a rascal, and I refuse to follow his instructions. I shall never give up the symbols of Väsudeva, especially My disc. I shall use this disc to kill not only King Pauëòraka but all his followers also. I shall destroy this Pauëòraka and his foolish associates, who merely constitute a society of cheaters and the cheated.' \""
