Thus he challenged Lord Kåñëa with the following message: \"Since I alone am the true Personality of Godhead, You should give up Your false claim to this position, as well as my divine symbols, and take shelter of me. If You do not, then prepare for battle.\""

And when you lie down on the battlefield, you will become the shelter of dogs.\""

His friend Käçiräja followed him, leading the rear guard. Just as the fire of universal devastation destroys every living being in all directions, so Lord Kåñëa annihilated the armies of Pauëòraka and Käçiräja. Then, after chastising Pauëòraka, the Lord beheaded both him and Käçiräja with His Sudarçana disc. Thereafter, He returned to Dvärakä. Because Pauëòraka had constantly meditated on the Supreme Lord, even dressing like Him, he gained liberation."

At that time a son of Käçiräja's named Sudakñiëa, wanting to avenge his father' s death, began worshiping Lord Çiva with the intention of destroying his father's killer. Gratified by Sudakñiëa's worship, Lord Çiva offered him a choice of benedictions, and Sudakñiëa asked for a means to kill the one who had slain his father. Lord Çiva advised him to worship the Dakñiëägni fire with black magic rituals. This Sudakñiëa did, with the result that a fearsome demon with a body of flames appeared from the pit of the sacrificial fire. The demon rose up carrying a fiery trident and at once set off for Dvärakä."

The Sudarçana overpowered the demon, who then returned to Väräëasé and burned Sudakñiëa to ashes, together with his priests. The Sudarçana disc, following the demon, entered Väräëasé and burned the entire city to the ground. Then the Lord's disc returned to His side in Dvärakä."
