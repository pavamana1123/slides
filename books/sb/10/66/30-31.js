Then the Dakñiëägni fire, together with many Pramathas, will fulfill your desire if you direct it against someone inimical to the brähmaëas.\" So instructed, Sudakñiëa strictly observed the ritualistic vows and invoked the abhicära against Lord Kåñëa.",

Lord Kåñëa, however, is most favorable to the brähmaëas and in fact maintains the brahminical culture. Lord Çiva thus knew that if Sudakñiëa attempted to direct the power of this ritual against Lord Kåñëa, Sudakñiëa himself would perish."
