After bathing in the Sarasvaté River and worshiping Lord Sadäçiva, a form of Lord Viñëu, they decided to spend the night in the forest. As they slept, a hungry serpent came and began to swallow Nanda Mahäräja. Terrified, Nanda cried out in distress, \"O Kåñëa! O my son, please save this surrendered soul!\" The cowherd men immediately awoke and began beating the serpent with wooden torches, but the serpent would not release Nanda. Then Lord Kåñëa came and touched the serpent with His lotus foot. The serpent was immediately freed from his reptilian body and appeared in his original form as a demigod. He told them about his previous identity and described how he had been cursed by a group of sages. Then he offered his homage at the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa and, on the Lord's order, returned to his own abode."

The girlfriends of Baladeva and those of Kåñëa joined together and sang about Their transcendental qualities. When the two Lords became absorbed in singing to the point of apparent intoxication, a servant of Kuvera's named Çaìkhacüòa boldly came forward and began abducting the gopés. The young girls called out, \"Kåñëa, please save us!\" and He and Räma began to chase after Çaìkhacüòa. \"Don't be afraid!\" Kåñëa called out to the gopés. In fear of the Lords, Çaìkhacüòa left the gopés aside and ran for his life. Kåñëa chased after him, swiftly approached him and with a blow of His fist removed Çaìkhacüòa's jewel, together with his head. Then Kåñëa brought the jewel back and presented it to Lord Baladeva."
