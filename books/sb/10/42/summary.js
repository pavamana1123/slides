The Lord asked her who she was and requested some ointment from her. Entranced by His beauty and joking words, Trivakrä gave both Kåñëa and Balaräma a good deal of ointment. In return, Kåñëa stepped on her toes with His lotus feet, took hold of her chin and lifted, thus straightening her spine. The now beautiful and charming Trivakrä then grabbed the edge of Kåñëa's upper cloth and asked Him to come to her house. Kåñëa replied that after He had taken care of some business He would certainly come and relieve her mental torment. Then the two Lords continued Their sightseeing tour of Mathurä."

Kåñëa asked where the bow sacrifice was to take place, and when He arrived at the arena He saw the wonderful bow, which resembled Lord Indra's. Despite the guards' protests, Kåñëa forcibly picked up the bow, easily strung it and in an instant broke it in half, producing an ear-splitting sound that filled the heavens and struck terror in the heart of Kaàsa. The many guards attacked Kåñëa, crying out \"Seize Him! Kill Him!\" But Kåñëa and Balaräma simply picked up the two halves of the bow and beat the guards to death. Next the Lords annihilated a company of soldiers sent by Kaàsa, and then They left the arena and continued Their tour."

When he heard how Kåñëa and Balaräma had easily broken the mighty bow and destroyed his soldiers, he spent the night in great anxiety. Both while awake and while dreaming he saw many ill omens portending his imminent death, and his fear ruined any chance for rest."

Kaàsa, his heart trembling, sat down on the royal dais and invited Nanda Mahäräja and the other cowherd men to come sit in their places, and they did so after offering him their gifts. The musical overture then began as the sounds of the wrestlers slapping their arms resounded."
