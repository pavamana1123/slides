Satyabhämä is the Lord's internal energy known as Bhü-çakti, and this expansion of hers, known as Påthivé, represents the earth, which was bent down by the great burden of countless wicked rulers. Lord Kåñëa descended to remove these wicked rulers, and thus His pastime of straightening out the hunchback Trivakrä, as explained in these verses, represents His rectifying the burdened condition of the earth. At the same time, the Lord awarded Trivakrä a conjugal relationship with Himself."
