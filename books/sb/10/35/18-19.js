    "translation": "Now Kåñëa is standing somewhere counting His cows on a string of gems. He wears a garland of tulasé flowers that bear the fragrance of His beloved, and He has thrown His arm over the shoulder of an affectionate cowherd boyfriend. As Kåñëa plays His flute and sings, the music attracts the black deer's wives, who approach that ocean of transcendental qualities and sit down beside Him. Just like us cowherd girls, they have given up all hope for happiness in family life.",

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté gives the following information about the transcendental cows of Våndävana: \"For each of the four colors of cows—white, red, black and yellow—there are twenty-five subdivisions, making a total of one hundred colors. And such qualities as being colored like sandalwood-pulp tilaka [speckled] or having a head shaped like a mådaìga drum create eight further groups. To count these 108 groups of cows, distinguished by color and form, Kåñëa is using a string of 108 jewel-beads...."

The reddish cows are called Aruëé, Kuìkuma, Sarasvaté, etc., the blackish ones Çyämalä, Dhümalä, Yamunä, etc., and the yellowish ones Pétä, Piìgalä, Haritälikä, etc. Those in the group with tilaka marks on their foreheads are called Citritä, Citra-tilakä, Dérgha-tilakä and Tiryak-tilakä, and there are groups known as Mådaìga-mukhé [mådaìga-head], Siàha-mukhé [lion-head] and so on."
