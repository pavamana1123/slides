    "translation": "As Kåñëa strolls through Vraja with His lotus-petal-like feet, marking the ground with the distinctive emblems of flag, thunderbolt, lotus and elephant goad, He relieves the distress the ground feels from the cows' hooves. As He plays His renowned flute, His body moves with the grace of an elephant. Thus we gopés, who become agitated by Cupid when Kåñëa playfully glances at us, stand as still as trees, unaware that our hair and garments are slackening.",

It is clear from the comments of Jéva Gosvämé and other äcäryas that the statements in this chapter were made at various times and places. This is natural, since the gopés were always absorbed in thoughts of Çré Kåñëa, day and night."
