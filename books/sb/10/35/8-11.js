    "translation": "Kåñëa moves about the forest in the company of His friends, who vividly chant the glories of His magnificent deeds. He thus appears just like the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibiting His inexhaustible opulences. When the cows wander onto the mountainsides and Kåñëa calls out to them with the sound of His flute, the trees and creepers in the forest respond by becoming so luxuriant with fruits and flowers that they seem to be manifesting Lord Viñëu within their hearts. As their branches bend low with the weight, the filaments on their trunks and vines stand erect out of the ecstasy of love of God, and both the trees and the creepers pour down a rain of sweet sap.Maddened by the divine, honeylike aroma of the tulasé flowers on the garland Kåñëa wears, swarms of bees sing loudly for Him, and that most beautiful of all persons thankfully acknowledges and acclaims their song by taking His flute to His lips and playing it. The charming flute song then steals away the minds of the cranes, swans and other lake-dwelling birds. Indeed they approach Kåñëa, close their eyes and, maintaining strict silence, worship Him by fixing their consciousness upon Him in deep meditation.",

He gives the analogy that just as when householder Vaiñëavas hear a saìkértana party approaching they become ecstatic and offer obeisances, so the trees and creepers in Våndävana became ecstatic when they heard Kåñëa's flute and bowed low with their branches and vines. The word darçanéya-tilaka in Text 10 indicates not only that the Lord is \"the most excellent (to see),\" but also that He decorated Himself with attractive reddish tilaka taken from the mineral rich earth of Våndävana forest."

However, early in the morning tulasé emits a transcendental fragrance that ordinary people cannot perceive but that transcendental personalities fully appreciate. The bees who are privileged to swarm about the flower garlands worn by the Supreme Personality of Godhead certainly appreciate this fragrance, and Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté quotes from the Bhägavatam  to the effect that the most fragrant plants in Vaikuëöha also appreciate the special qualifications of Tulasé-devé."
