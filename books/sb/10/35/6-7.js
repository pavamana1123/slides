    "translation": "My dear gopé, sometimes Mukunda imitates the appearance of a wrestler by decorating Himself with leaves, peacock feathers and colored minerals. Then, in the company of Balaräma and the cowherd boys, He plays His flute to call the cows. At that time the rivers stop flowing, their water stunned by the ecstasy they feel as they eagerly wait for the wind to bring them the dust of His lotus feet. But like us, the rivers are not very pious, and thus they merely wait with their arms trembling out of love.",

            "content": "The gopés state here that the sound of Kåñëa's flute causes even inanimate objects like rivers to become conscious and then stunned in ecstasy. Just as the gopés could not always be in Kåñëa's physical association, the rivers could not come to the Lord's lotus feet. Although they desired the Lord, their movement was checked by ecstasy, and their \"arms,\" their waves, trembled with love of Godhead."
