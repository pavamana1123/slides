    "translation": "O pious mother Yaçodä, your son, who is expert in all the arts of herding cows, has invented many new styles of flute-playing. When He takes His flute to His bimba-red lips and sends forth the tones of the harmonic scale in variegated melodies, Brahmä, Çiva, Indra and other chief demigods become confused upon hearing the sound. Although they are the most learned authorities, they cannot ascertain the essence of that music, and thus they bow down their heads and hearts.",

            "content": "The words tava sutaù sati, \"your son, O chaste lady,\" clearly indicate that at this point mother Yaçodä is among the young gopés as they earnestly describe Lord Kåñëa's glories. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, among the demigods led by Çakra (Lord Indra) were Upendra, Agni and Yamaräja, among those led by Çarva (Lord Çiva) were Kätyäyané, Skanda and Gaëeça, and among those led by Parameñöhé (Lord Brahmä) were the four Kumäras and Närada. Thus the best collective intelligence in the universe could not definitively analyze the enchanting musical arrangements of the Supreme Lord."
