    "translation": "Out of great affection for the cows of Vraja, Kåñëa became the lifter of Govardhana Hill. At the end of the day, having rounded up all His own cows, He plays a song on His flute, while exalted demigods standing along the path worship His lotus feet and the cowherd boys accompanying Him chant His glories. His garland is powdered by the dust raised by the cows' hooves, and His beauty, enhanced by His fatigue, creates an ecstatic festival for everyone's eyes. Eager to fulfill His friends' desires, Kåñëa is the moon arisen from the womb of mother Yaçodä.",

Mother Yaçodä was very anxious for her son to come back, and therefore she had the tallest of the beautiful young gopés climb up to see when He would arrive. It is implied here that Kåñëa was somewhat delayed on the way home because His lotus feet were being worshiped by great demigods along the path."
