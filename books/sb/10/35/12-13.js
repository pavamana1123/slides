    "translation": "O goddesses of Vraja, when Kåñëa is enjoying Himself with Balaräma on the mountain slopes, playfully wearing a flower garland on the top of His head, He engladdens all with the resonant vibrations of His flute. Thus He delights the entire world. At that time the nearby cloud, afraid of offending a great personality, thunders very gently in accompaniment. The cloud showers flowers onto his dear friend Kåñëa and shades Him from the sun like an umbrella.",
