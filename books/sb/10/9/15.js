            "content": "Here is the first chapter in Kåñëa's exhibition of unlimited potency to mother Yaçodä when she tried to bind Him: the rope was too short. The Lord had already shown His unlimited potency by killing Pütanä, Çakaöäsura and Tåëävarta. Now Kåñëa exhibited another vibhüti, or display of potency, to mother Yaçodä. \"Unless I agree,\" Kåñëa desired to show, \"you cannot bind Me.\" Thus although mother Yaçodä, in her attempt to bind Kåñëa, added one rope after another, ultimately she was a failure. When Kåñëa agreed, however, she was successful. In other words, one must be in transcendental love with Kåñëa, but that does not mean that one can control Kåñëa. When Kåñëa is satisfied with one's devotional service, He does everything Himself. Sevonmukhe hi jihvädau svayam eva sphuraty adaù. He reveals more and more to the devotee as the devotee advances in service. Jihvädau: this service begins with the tongue, with chanting and with taking the prasäda of Kåñëa."
