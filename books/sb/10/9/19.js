Yet the Supreme Lord has one transcendental attribute: He comes under the control of His devotees. This was now exhibited by Kåñëa in this pastime.",

            "content": "By His one plenary portion as Paramätmä, the Lord controls innumerable universes, with all their demigods; yet He agrees to be controlled by a devotee. In the Upaniñads it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can run with more speed than the mind, but here we see that although Kåñëa wanted to avoid being arrested by His mother, He was finally defeated, and mother Yaçodä captured Him. Lakñmé-sahasra-çata-sambhrama-sevyamänam: (BS 5.29) Kåñëa is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. Nonetheless, He steals butter like one who is poverty-stricken. Yamaräja, the controller of all living entities, fears the order of Kåñëa, yet Kåñëa is afraid of His mother's stick. These contradictions cannot be understood by one who is not a devotee, but a devotee can understand how powerful is unalloyed devotional service to Kåñëa; it is so powerful that Kåñëa can be controlled by an unalloyed devotee. This bhåtya-vaçyatä does not mean that He is under the control of the servant; rather, He is under the control of the servant's pure love. In Bhagavad-gétä  it is said that Kåñëa became the chariot driver of Arjuna. Arjuna ordered Him, senayor ubhayor madhye rathaà sthäpaya me 'cyuta: \"My dear Kåñëa, You have agreed to be my charioteer and to execute my orders. Place my chariot between the two armies of soldiers.\" Kåñëa immediately executed this order, and therefore one may argue that Kåñëa also is not independent. But this is one's ajïäna, ignorance. Kåñëa is always fully independent; when He becomes subordinate to His devotees, this is a display of änanda-cinmaya-rasa, the humor of transcendental qualities that increases His transcendental pleasure. Everyone worships Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He sometimes desires to be controlled by someone else. Such a controller can be no one else but a pure devotee."
