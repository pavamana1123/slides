    "translation": "When Lord Çré Kåñëa saw His mother, stick in hand, He very quickly got down from the top of the mortar and began to flee as if very much afraid. Although yogés try to capture Him as Paramätmä by meditation, desiring to enter into the effulgence of the Lord with great austerities and penances, they fail to reach Him. But mother Yaçodä, thinking that same Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, to be her son, began following Kåñëa to catch Him.",

            "content": "Yogés, mystics, want to catch Kåñëa as Paramätmä, and with great austerities and penances they try to approach Him, yet they cannot. Here we see, however, that Kåñëa is going to be caught by Yaçodä and is running away in fear. This illustrates the difference between the bhakta and the yogé. Yogés cannot reach Kåñëa, but for pure devotees like mother Yaçodä, Kåñëa is already caught. Kåñëa was even afraid of mother Yaçodä's stick. This was mentioned by Queen Kunté in her prayers: bhaya-bhävanayä sthitasya . Kåñëa is afraid of mother Yaçodä, and yogés are afraid of Kåñëa. Yogés try to reach Kåñëa by jïäna-yoga and other yogas, but fail. Yet although mother Yaçodä was a woman, Kåñëa was afraid of her, as clearly described in this verse."
