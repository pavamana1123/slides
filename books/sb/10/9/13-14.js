    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no beginning and no end, no exterior and no interior, no front and no rear. In other words, He is all-pervading. Because He is not under the influence of the element of time, for Him there is no difference between past, present and future; He exists in His own transcendental form at all times. Being absolute, beyond relativity, He is free from distinctions between cause and effect, although He is the cause and effect of everything. That unmanifested person, who is beyond the perception of the senses, had now appeared as a human child, and mother Yaçodä, considering Him her own ordinary child, bound Him to the wooden mortar with a rope.",

The word brahma means \"the greatest.\" Kåñëa is greater than the greatest, being unlimited and all-pervading. How can it be possible for the all-pervading to be measured or bound? Then again, Kåñëa is the time factor. Therefore, He is all-pervading not only in space but also in time. We have measurements of time, but although we are limited by past, present and future, for Kåñëa these do not exist. Every individual person can be measured, but Kåñëa has already shown that although He also is an individual, the entire cosmic manifestation is within His mouth. All these points considered, Kåñëa cannot be measured. How then did Yaçodä want to measure Him and bind Him? We must conclude that this took place simply on the platform of pure transcendental love. This was the only cause."
