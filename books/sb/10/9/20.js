Nonetheless, even he could not obtain such mercy as mother Yaçodä. As for Lord Çiva, he is the topmost Vaiñëava (vaiñëavänäà yathä çambhuù). What to speak of Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, the goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, is the Lord's constant companion in service, since she always associates with His body. But even she could not get such mercy. Therefore Mahäräja Parékñit was surprised, thinking, \"What did mother Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja do in their previous lives by which they got such a great opportunity, the opportunity to be the affectionate father and mother of Kåñëa?\""

When anything is uttered three times—\"do it, do it, do it\"—one should understand that this is meant to indicate great stress on a fact. In this verse, we find na lebhire, na lebhire, na lebhire. Yet mother Yaçodä is in the supermost exalted position, and thus Kåñëa has become completely subordinate to her."

There are different types of liberation, such as säyujya, sälokya, särüpya, särñöi and sämépya , but vimukti means \"special mukti.\" When after liberation one is situated on the platform of prema-bhakti, one is said to have achieved vimukti, \"special mukti.\" Therefore the word na is mentioned. That exalted platform of premä is described by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu as premä pum-artho mahän, and mother Yaçodä naturally acts in such an exalted position in loving affairs. She is therefore a nitya-siddha devotee, an expansion of Kåñëa's hlädiné potency, His potency to enjoy transcendental bliss through expansions who are special devotees (änanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhävitäbhiù (BS 5.37)). Such devotees are not sädhana-siddha."
