Even today in India, this festival is generally celebrated very gorgeously in the month of Kärtika by fireworks and lights, especially in Bombay. It is to be understood that among all the cows of Nanda Mahäräja, several of mother Yaçodä's cows ate only grasses so flavorful that the grasses would automatically flavor the milk. Mother Yaçodä wanted to collect the milk from these cows, make it into yogurt and churn it into butter personally, since she thought that this child Kåñëa was going to the houses of neighborhood gopas and gopés to steal butter because He did not like the milk and yogurt ordinarily prepared."

            "content": "While churning the butter, mother Yaçodä was singing about the childhood activities of Kåñëa. It was formerly a custom that if one wanted to remember something constantly, he would transform it into poetry or have this done by a professional poet. It appears that mother Yaçodä did not want to forget Kåñëa's activities at any time. Therefore she poeticized all of Kåñëa's childhood activities, such as the killing of Pütanä, Aghäsura, Çakaöäsura and Tåëävarta, and while churning the butter, she sang about these activities in poetical form. This should be the practice of persons eager to remain Kåñëa conscious twenty-four hours a day. This incident shows how Kåñëa conscious mother Yaçodä was. To stay in Kåñëa consciousness, we should follow such persons."
