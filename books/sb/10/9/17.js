    "translation": "Thus mother Yaçodä joined whatever ropes were available in the household, but still she failed in her attempt to bind Kåñëa. Mother Yaçodä's friends, the elderly gopés in the neighborhood, were smiling and enjoying the fun. Similarly, mother Yaçodä, although laboring in that way, was also smiling. All of them were struck with wonder.",

            "content": "Actually this incident was wonderful because Kåñëa was only a child with small hands. To bind Him should have required only a rope not more than two feet long. All the ropes in the house combined together might have been hundreds of feet long, but still He was impossible to bind, for all the ropes together were still too short. Naturally mother Yaçodä and her gopé friends thought, \"How is this possible?\" Seeing this funny affair, all of them were smiling. The first rope was short by a measurement the width of two fingers, and after the second rope was added, it was still two fingers too short. If the shortness of all the ropes were added together, it must have amounted to the width of hundreds of fingers. Certainly this was astonishing. This was another exhibition of Kåñëa's inconceivable potency to His mother and His mother's friends."
