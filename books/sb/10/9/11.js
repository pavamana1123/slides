    "translation": "When caught by mother Yaçodä, Kåñëa became more and more afraid and admitted to being an offender. As she looked upon Him, she saw that He was crying, His tears mixing with the black ointment around His eyes, and as He rubbed His eyes with His hands, He smeared the ointment all over His face. Mother Yaçodä, catching her beautiful son by the hand, mildly began to chastise Him.",

            "content": "From these dealings between mother Yaçodä and Kåñëa, we can understand the exalted position of a pure devotee in loving service to the Lord. Yogés, jïänés, karmés and Vedäntists cannot even approach Kåñëa; they must remain very, very far away from Him and try to enter His bodily effulgence, although this also they are unable to do. Great demigods like Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva always worship the Lord by meditation and by service. Even the most powerful Yamaräja fears Kåñëa. Therefore, as we find in the history of Ajämila, Yamaräja instructed his followers not even to approach the devotees, what to speak of capturing them. In other words, Yamaräja also fears Kåñëa and Kåñëa's devotees. Yet this Kåñëa became so dependent on mother Yaçodä that when she simply showed Kåñëa the stick in her hand, Kåñëa admitted to being an offender and began to cry like an ordinary child. Mother Yaçodä, of course, did not want to chastise her beloved child very much, and therefore she immediately threw her stick away and simply rebuked Kåñëa, saying, \"Now I shall bind You so that You cannot commit any further offensive activities. Nor for the time being can You play with Your playmates.\" This shows the position of a pure devotee, in contrast with others, like jïänés, yogés and the followers of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, in regarding the transcendental nature of the Absolute Truth."
