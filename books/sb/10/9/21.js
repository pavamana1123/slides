            "content": "\"As living entities surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Påthä.\" Everyone is seeking Kåñëa, for He is the Supersoul of all individual souls. Everyone loves his body and wants to protect it because he is within the body as the soul, and everyone loves the soul because the soul is part and parcel of the Supersoul. Therefore, everyone is actually seeking to achieve happiness by reviving his relationship with the Supersoul. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä , vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: \"By all the Vedas, it is I who am to be known.\" Therefore, the karmés, jïänés, yogés and saintly persons are all seeking Kåñëa. But by following in the footsteps of devotees who are in a direct relationship with Kåñëa, especially the inhabitants of Våndävana, one can reach the supreme position of associating with Kåñëa. As it is said, våndävanaà parityajya padam ekaà na gacchati: Kåñëa does not leave Våndävana even for a moment. The våndävana-väsés—mother Yaçodä, Kåñëa's friends and Kåñëa's conjugal lovers, the younger gopés with whom He dances—have very intimate relationships with Kåñëa, and if one follows in the footsteps of these devotees, Kåñëa is available. Although the nitya-siddha expansions of Kåñëa always remain with Kåñëa, if those engaged in sädhana-siddhi follow in the footsteps of Kåñëa's nitya-siddha associates, such sädhana-siddhas also can easily attain Kåñëa without difficulty. But there are those who are attached to bodily concepts of life. Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, for example, have very prestigious positions, and thus they have the sense of being very exalted éçvaras. In other words, because Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva are guëa-avatäras and have exalted positions, they have some small sense of being like Kåñëa. But the pure devotees who inhabit Våndävana do not possess any bodily conception. They are fully dedicated to the service of the Lord in sublime affection, premä. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has therefore recommended, premä pum-artho mahän: the highest perfection of life is premä, pure love in relationship with Kåñëa. And mother Yaçodä appears to be the topmost of devotees who have attained this perfection."
