The maidservants being engaged in other business, she stopped allowing Kåñëa to drink from her breast and immediately attended to the overflowing milk pan. Kåñëa became very angry because of His mother's behavior and devised a means of breaking the pots of yogurt. Because He created this disturbance, mother Yaçodä decided to bind Him. These incidents are described in this chapter."

            "content": "One day, the maidservants being engaged in other work, mother Yaçodä was churning the yogurt into butter herself, and in the meantime Kåñëa came and requested her to allow Him to suck her breast milk. Of course, mother Yaçodä immediately allowed Him to do so, but then she saw that the hot milk on the oven was boiling over, and therefore she immediately stopped allowing Kåñëa to drink the milk of her breast and went to stop the milk on the oven from overflowing. Kåñëa, however, having been interrupted in His business of sucking the breast, was very angry. He took a piece of stone, broke the churning pot and entered a room, where He began to eat the freshly churned butter. When mother Yaçodä, after attending to the overflowing milk, returned and saw the pot broken, she could understand that this was the work of Kåñëa, and therefore she went to search for Him. When she entered the room, she saw Kåñëa standing on the ulükhala, a large mortar for grinding spices. Having turned the mortar upside down, He was stealing butter hanging from a swing and was distributing the butter to the monkeys. As soon as Kåñëa saw that His mother had come, He immediately began to run away, and mother Yaçodä began to follow Him. After going some distance, mother Yaçodä was able to catch Kåñëa, who because of His offense was crying. Mother Yaçodä, of course, threatened to punish Kåñëa if He acted that way again, and she decided to bind Him with rope. Unfortunately, when the time came to knot the rope, the rope with which she wanted to bind Him was short by a distance equal to the width of two fingers. When she made the rope longer by adding another rope, she again saw that it was short by two fingers. Again and again she tried, and again and again she found the rope too short by two fingers. Thus she became very tired, and Kåñëa, seeing His affectionate mother so tired, allowed Himself to be bound. Now, being compassionate, He did not show her His unlimited potency. After mother Yaçodä bound Kåñëa and became engaged in other household affairs, Kåñëa observed two yamala-arjuna trees, which were actually Nalaküvara and Maëigréva, two sons of Kuvera who had been condemned by Närada Muni to become trees. Kåñëa, by His mercy, now began to proceed toward the trees to fulfill the desire of Närada Muni."
