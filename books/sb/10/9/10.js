    "translation": "While following Kåñëa, mother Yaçodä, her thin waist overburdened by her heavy breasts, naturally had to reduce her speed. Because of following Kåñëa very swiftly, her hair became loose, and the flowers in her hair were falling after her. Yet she did not fail to capture her son Kåñëa.",

This is the difference between a yogé and a bhakta. Yogés cannot enter even the effulgence of Kåñëa. Yasya prabhä prabhavato jagad-aëòa-koöi-koöiñu (BS 5.40). In that effulgence there are millions of universes, but yogés and jïänés cannot enter that effulgence even after many, many years of austerities, whereas bhaktas can capture Kåñëa simply by love and affection. This is the example shown here by mother Yaçodä. Kåñëa therefore confirms that if one wants to capture Him, one must undertake devotional service."
