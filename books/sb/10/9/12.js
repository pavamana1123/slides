    "translation": "Mother Yaçodä was always overwhelmed by intense love for Kåñëa, not knowing who Kåñëa was or how powerful He was. Because of maternal affection for Kåñëa, she never even cared to know who He was. Therefore, when she saw that her son had become excessively afraid, she threw the stick away and desired to bind Him so that He would not commit any further naughty activities.",

That would be another disturbance. Therefore, because of full affection, to stop Kåñëa from leaving the house, she wanted to bind Him with rope. Mother Yaçodä wanted to impress upon Kåñëa that since He was afraid merely to see her stick, He should not perform such disturbing activities as breaking the container of yogurt and butter and distributing its contents to the monkeys. Mother Yaçodä did not care to understand who Kåñëa was and how His power spreads everywhere. This is an example of pure love for Kåñëa."
