    "translation": "Dressed in a saffron-yellow sari, with a belt tied about her full hips, mother Yaçodä pulled on the churning rope, laboring considerably, her bangles and earrings moving and vibrating and her whole body shaking. Because of her intense love for her child, her breasts were wet with milk. Her face, with its very beautiful eyebrows, was wet with perspiration, and mälaté flowers were falling from her hair.",

            "content": "Anyone who desires to be Kåñëa conscious in motherly affection or parental affection should contemplate the bodily features of mother Yaçodä. It is not that one should desire to become like Yaçodä, for this is Mäyäväda. Either in parental affection or conjugal love, friendship or servitorship—in any way—we must follow in the footsteps of the inhabitants of Våndävana, not try to become like them. Therefore this description is provided here. Advanced devotees must cherish this description, always thinking of mother Yaçodä's features—how she was dressed, how she was working and perspiring, how beautifully the flowers were arranged in her hair, and so on. One should take advantage of the full description provided here by thinking of mother Yaçodä in maternal affection for Kåñëa."
