To placate him, every month they would leave various offerings for him at the foot of a banyan tree. But Käliya, puffed-up as he was with false pride, would eat these offerings himself. Hearing of this, Garuòa became furious and went to kill Käliya, whereupon the snake began biting the great bird. Garuòa fiercely beat him with his wing, sending Käliya fleeing for his life to a lake adjoining the Yamunä River."

Saubhari Åñi had tried to stop him, but Garuòa, agitated by hunger, had refused to heed the sage's prohibitions, and in response the sage had cursed Garuòa that if he ever came there again he would immediately die. Käliya had heard of this, and thus he lived there without fear. In the end, however, he was driven out by Çré Kåñëa."

The spiritual masters, priests and learned brähmaëas then told Nanda Mahäräja, the king of the cowherds, that although his son had been caught in the grips of Käliya, it was by the king's good fortune that He was now free again."

In the middle of the night, a fire happened to blaze up within the forest, which had become dry during the hot season. As the fire surrounded the sleeping inhabitants of Våndävana, they suddenly awoke and rushed to Çré Kåñëa for protection. Then the unlimitedly powerful Lord Çré Kåñëa, seeing His dear relatives and friends so distressed, immediately swallowed up the terrible forest fire."
