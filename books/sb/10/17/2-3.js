    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: To avoid being eaten by Garuòa, the serpents had previously made an arrangement with him whereby they would each make a monthly offering of tribute at the base of a tree. Thus every month on schedule, O mighty-armed King Parékñit, each serpent would duly make his offering to that powerful carrier of Viñëu as a purchase of protection.",

            "content": "Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has given an alternate explanation of this verse. Upahäryaiù may also be translated as \"by those who are to be eaten,\" and sarpa-janaiù as \"those human beings who were dominated by or who belonged to the serpent race.\" According to this reading, a group of human beings had fallen under the control of the serpents and were prone to be eaten by them. To avoid this, the human beings would make a monthly offering to the serpents, who in turn would offer a portion of that offering to Garuòa so that he would not eat them. The particular translation given above is based on the commentary of Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé and the translation by Çréla Prabhupäda in his Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In any case, all the äcäryas agree that the serpents purchased protection from Garuòa."
