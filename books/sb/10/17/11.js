The Ninth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam describes his falldown for this offense. Because of false pride, Saubhari Muni lost his power of austerity, and with it his spiritual beauty and happiness. When Garuòa came to the Yamunä, Saubhari Muni thought, \"Although he may be a personal associate of the Supreme Lord, I will still curse him and even kill him if he disobeys my order.\" Such an offensive attitude against an exalted Vaiñëava will certainly destroy one's auspicious position in life."
