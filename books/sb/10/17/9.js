It is the nature of birds to eat fish, and thus, by the arrangement of the Lord, the great bird Garuòa does not commit any offense by nourishing himself with fish. On the other hand, Saubhari Muni's forbidding a much greater personality to eat his normal food did constitute an offense. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Saubhari committed two offenses: first, he dared to give an order to a supremely exalted soul like Garuòa, and second, he obstructed Garuòa from satisfying his desire."
