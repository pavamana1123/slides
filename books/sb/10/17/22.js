The residents of Våndävana took shelter of Kåñëa, thinking, \"This blessed boy will certainly be empowered by God to save us.\" They remembered the words of the sage Garga Muni, spoken at the birth ceremony of Lord Kåñëa: anena sarva-durgäëi yüyam aïjas tariñyatha. \"By His power you will easily be able to cross over all obstacles.\"  Therefore the residents of Våndävana, who had full faith in Kåñëa, took shelter of the Lord in hopes of being saved from the impending disaster threatened by the forest fire."
