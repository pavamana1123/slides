    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: While gazing at their beloved Kåñëa, the young gopés used to condemn the creator of their eyelids, [which would momentarily block their vision of Him]. Now, seeing Kåñëa again after such a long separation, with their eyes they took Him into their hearts, and there they embraced Him to their full satisfaction. In this way they became totally absorbed in ecstatic meditation on Him, although those who constantly practice mystic yoga find such absorption difficult to achieve.",

Seeing them trembling with eagerness to meet Kåñëa, and apparently ready to give up their lives if they could not, He tactfully decided to get up and involve Himself elsewhere. Then the gopés attained the state described in the current verse. In referring to the gopés' intolerant disrespect of Lord Brahmä, \"the creator of eyelids,\" Çukadeva Gosvämé is giving vent to his own subtle jealousy of the gopés' favored position."

No one can even imagine how anxious the gopés were to see Kåñëa again. As soon as Kåñëa became visible to them, they took Him inside their hearts through their eyes and embraced Him to their full satisfaction. Even though they were embracing Kåñëa only mentally, they became so ecstatic and overwhelmed with joy that for the time being they completely forgot themselves. The ecstatic trance which they achieved simply by mentally embracing Kåñëa is impossible to achieve even for great yogés constantly engaged in meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kåñëa could understand that the gopés were rapt in ecstasy by embracing Him in their minds, and therefore, since He is present in everyone's heart, He also reciprocated the embracing from within.\""
