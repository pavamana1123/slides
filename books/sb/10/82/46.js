The various objects of material enjoyment, such as pots, rivers and mountains, are manufactured from the basic material elements—earth, water, fire and so on. These elements pervade material things as their cause, while the spirit souls pervade them in their special role as their enjoyer (svätmanä). And ultimately, the material elements, their products and the living entities are all manifested within and pervaded by the imperishable, perfectly complete Supreme Soul, Kåñëa."

            "content": "A jïäné with realization of these facts should feel no separation from the Lord in any situation, but the gopés of Vraja are much more elevated in their Kåñëa consciousness than ordinary jïänés. Because of their intense love for Kåñëa in His most humanlike, all-attractive aspect as a young cowherd boy, Kåñëa's internal potency, Yogamäyä, covered their knowledge of His majestic aspects, such as His all-pervasiveness. Thus the gopés were able to relish the intense ecstasy caused by their love in separation from Him. Only in jest is Çré Kåñëa ascribing to them a lack of spiritual discrimination."
