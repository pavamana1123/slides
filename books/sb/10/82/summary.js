After the Yadus had bathed and performed other obligatory rituals, they noticed that kings of Matsya, Uçénara and other places had also come, as well as Nanda Mahäräja and the cowherd community of Vraja, who were always feeling the intense anxiety of separation from Kåñëa. The Yädavas, overjoyed to see all these old friends, embraced them one by one as they shed tears of happiness. Their wives also embraced one another with great pleasure."

Seeing Nanda Mahäräja, the Yädavas were delighted, and each of them embraced him tightly. Vasudeva also embraced Nanda with great joy and remembered how, when Vasudeva was tormented by Kaàsa, Nanda had taken his sons, Kåñëa and Balaräma, under his protection. Balaräma and Kåñëa embraced and bowed down to mother Yaçodä, but Their throats choked up with emotion and they could say nothing to her. Nanda and Yaçodä lifted their two sons onto their laps and embraced Them, and in this way they relieved the distress of separation. Rohiëé and Devaké both embraced Yaçodä and, remembering the great friendship she had shown them, told her that the kindness she had done by raising and supporting Kåñëa and Balaräma could not be repaid even with the wealth of Indra."

He consoled them by pointing out that He is all-pervasive, being the source of all energies, and thus He implied that they could never be separated from Him. Having been at long last reunited with Kåñëa, the gopés prayed simply to have His lotus feet manifested in their hearts."
