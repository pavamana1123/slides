    "translation": "The gopés spoke thus: Dear Lord, whose navel is just like a lotus flower, Your lotus feet are the only shelter for those who have fallen into the deep well of material existence. Your feet are worshiped and meditated upon by great mystic yogés and highly learned philosophers. We wish that these lotus feet may also be awakened within our hearts, although we are only ordinary persons engaged in household affairs.",

Therefore You previously had Uddhava instruct us in the knowledge that dispels ignorance, and now You have done so Yourself. In this way You have purified our hearts of contamination, and as a result we understand Your pure love for us, free from any motivation other than assuring our liberation. But we are only unintelligent cowherd women; how can this knowledge remain fixed in our hearts? We cannot even meditate steadily on Your feet, the focus of realization for great souls like Lord Brahmä. Please be merciful to us and somehow make it possible for us to concentrate on You, even a little. We are still suffering the reactions of our own fruitive work, so how can we meditate on You, the goal of great yogés? Such yogés are immeasurably wise, but we are mere feeble-minded women. Please do something to get us out of this deep well of material life.\""

Only there, the gopés imply, can Kåñëa attract them by wearing peacock feathers in His turban and playing enchanting music with His flute. Only by His appearing again in Våndävana can the gopés be saved, not by any other kind of meditation on Him or theoretical knowledge of the self."
