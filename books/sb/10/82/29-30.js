    "translation": "His fame, as broadcast by the Vedas, the water that has washed His feet, and the words He speaks in the form of the revealed scriptures—these thoroughly purify this universe. Although the earth's good fortune was ravaged by time, the touch of His lotus feet has revitalized her, and thus she is raining down on us the fulfillment of all our desires. The same Lord Viñëu who makes one forget the goals of heaven and liberation has now entered into marital and blood relationships with you, who otherwise travel on the hellish path of family life. Indeed, in these relationships you see and touch Him directly, walk beside Him, converse with Him, and together with Him lie down to rest, sit at ease and take your meals.",

The words Viñëu Himself speaks, such as the Bhagavad-gétä, are the confidential essence of all scripture. In His manifestation as Vyäsadeva, the Supreme Lord composed both the Vedänta-sutras and Mahäbhärata, and this Mahäbhärata includes Çré Kåñëa's personal statement: vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyo/ vedänta-kåd veda-vid eva cäham. \"By all the Vedas, I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler of Vedänta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.\" "

The water of the transcendental river Virajä, lying just outside the universal egg, thus seeped inside, washing Lord Vämana's foot and flowing down to become the Ganges River. Because of the sanctity of its origin, the Ganges is generally considered the most holy of rivers. But even more potent is the water of the Yamunä, where Lord Viñëu in His original form of Govinda played with His intimate companions."

Not only do they see Kåñëa, but they are also directly connected with Him by dual bonds of marital and blood relationships. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté suggests that the word bandha, beside its more obvious meaning of \"relation,\" can also be understood in the sense of \"capture,\" expressing that the love the Yadus feel for the Lord obliges Him always to stay with them."
