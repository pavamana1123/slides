This must be so, the äcärya reasons, since during the eclipse at Kurukñetra all the Kurus, including Dhåtaräñöra, Yudhiñöhira, Bhéñma and Droëa, met in friendship and happily shared the company of Çré Kåñëa. At the Räjasüya-yajïa, on the other hand, Duryodhana's jealousy against the Päëòavas became irrevocably inflamed. Soon after this, Duryodhana challenged Yudhiñöhira and his brothers to the gambling match, in which he cheated them of their kingdom and exiled them to the forest. Right after the Päëòavas' return from exile, the great Battle of Kurukñetra took place, during which Bhéñma and Droëa were killed. So it is not logically possible for the solar eclipse at Kurukñetra to have happened after the Räjasüya sacrifice."
