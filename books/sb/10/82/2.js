The knowledge of the ancient astronomers went much further, however, since they understood the karmic influences of such events. Solar and lunar eclipses are generally very inauspicious, with certain rare exceptions. But just as the otherwise inauspicious Ekädaçé day becomes beneficial when used for the glorification of Lord Hari, so the time of an eclipse is also advantageous for fasting and worship."

The Kurus were thus advised by learned brähmaëas that this would be the best place for them to observe vows during the eclipse. Long before their time, Lord Paraçuräma had done penance at Kurukñetra to atone for his killings. Samanta-païcaka, the five ponds he dug there, were still present at the end of Dväpara-yuga, as they are even today."
