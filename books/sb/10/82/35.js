Following them inside were Rohiëé, other women and men of Vraja, and a number of attendants. Inside, Nanda and Yaçodä took the two boys on their laps. Despite having heard the glories of the two Lords of Dvärakä, and despite seeing these opulences now before their eyes, Nanda and Yaçodä looked upon Them as if They were still their eight-year-old children."
