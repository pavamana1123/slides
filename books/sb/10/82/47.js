The consciousness of the living entity who falsely presents himself as the enjoyer of the material world is called jéva-koça, which means imprisonment by the false ego. Not only the gopés but anyone who follows these instructions of Kåñëa becomes immediately freed from the jéva-koça imprisonment. A person in full Kåñëa consciousness is always liberated from false egoism; he utilizes everything for Kåñëa's service and is not at any time separated from Kåñëa.\""
