Çréla Jéva Gosvämé confirms this statement by quoting a phrase from the Bhägavatam  — gopyo 'ntareëa bhujayoù—which indicates that there are particular gopés who act as Lord Balaräma's girlfriends. Furthermore, Jéva Gosvämé states that during the Holé festivities celebrated when Kåñëa killed Çaìkhacüòa, the gopés Lord Balaräma enjoyed with were different from the ones Lord Kåñëa enjoyed with. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté agrees with this explanation."
