When He arrived there, the elder gopés and Lord Kåñëa's parents, Nanda and Yaçodä, who had all been in great anxiety for a long time, embraced Him and blessed Him. Lord Balaräma offered appropriate respects and greetings to each of His worshipable elders according to age, friendship and family relation. After Gokula's residents and Lord Balaräma had inquired about each other's welfare, the Lord rested from His journey."

They asked, \"Does Kåñëa still remember His parents and friends, and will He be coming to Gokula to visit them? For Kåñëa's sake we gave up everything-even our fathers, mothers and other relatives-but now He has abandoned us. How could we help but put our faith in Kåñëa's words after seeing His sweetly smiling face and thus being overwhelmed by the urges of Cupid? Still, if Kåñëa can spend His days in separation from us, why can't we tolerate separation from Him? So there is no reason to keep talking about Him.\" In this manner the gopés remembered Çré Kåñëa's charming talks, enchanting glances, playful gestures and loving embraces, and as a result they began to cry. Lord Balaräma consoled them by conveying the attractive messages Kåñëa had given Him for them."

He called out to the Yamunä, \"Come near so I and the gopés can enjoy sporting in your waters.\" But the Yamunä ignored His command. Lord Balaräma then started to pull the Yamunä with the end of His plow, splitting her into hundreds of tributaries. Trembling out of fright, the goddess Yamunä appeared, fell down at Lord Balaräma's feet and prayed for forgiveness. The Lord let her go and then entered her waters with His girlfriends to sport for some time. When they rose from the water, the goddess Känti presented Lord Balaräma with beautiful ornaments, clothing and garlands. Even today the Yamunä River flows through the many channels cut by Lord Baladeva's plow, the signs of His having subdued her."
