    "translation": "Lord Balaräma then paid proper respects to the elder cowherd men, and the younger ones all greeted Him respectfully. He met them all with smiles, handshakes and so on, dealing personally with each one according to age, degree of friendship, and family relationship. Then, after resting, the Lord accepted a comfortable seat, and they all gathered around Him. With voices faltering out of love for Him, those cowherds, who had dedicated everything to lotus-eyed Kåñëa, asked about the health of their dear ones [in Dvärakä], and Balaräma in turn asked about the cowherds' welfare.",
