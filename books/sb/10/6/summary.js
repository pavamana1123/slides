            "content": "While Nanda Mahäräja, the King of Vraja, was thinking about Vasudeva's words concerning disturbances in Gokula, he was a little afraid and sought shelter at the lotus feet of Çré Hari. Meanwhile, Kaàsa sent to the village of Gokula a Räkñasé named Pütanä, who was wandering here and there killing small babies. Of course, wherever there is no Kåñëa consciousness, there is the danger of such Räkñasés, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself was in Gokula, Pütanä could accept nothing there but her own death."

            "content": "One day, Pütanä arrived from outer space in Gokula, the home of Nanda Mahäräja, and by displaying her mystic power, she assumed the disguise of a very beautiful woman. Taking courage, she immediately entered Kåñëa's bedroom without anyone's permission; by the grace of Kåñëa, no one forbade her to enter the house or the room, because that was Kåñëa's desire. The baby Kåñëa, who resembled a fire covered by ashes, looked upon Pütanä and thought that He would have to kill this demon, the beautiful woman. Enchanted by the influence of yogamäyä and the Personality of Godhead, Pütanä took Kåñëa upon her lap, and neither Rohiëé nor Yaçodä objected. The demon Pütanä offered her breast for Kåñëa to suck, but her breast was smeared with poison. The child Kåñëa, therefore, squeezed Pütanä's breast so severely that in unbearable pain she had to assume her original body and fell to the ground. Then Kåñëa began playing on her breast just like a small child. When Kåñëa was playing, the gopés were pacified and took the child away to their own laps. After this incident, the gopés took precautions because of the attack of the Räkñasé. Mother Yaçodä gave the child her breast to suck and then laid Him in bed."

            "content": "Meanwhile, Nanda and his associates the cowherd men returned from Mathurä, and when they saw the great dead body of Pütanä, they were struck with wonder. Everyone was astonished that Vasudeva had foretold this mishap, and they praised Vasudeva for his power of foresight. The inhabitants of Vraja cut the gigantic body of Pütanä into pieces, but because Kåñëa had sucked her breast, she had been freed from all sins, and therefore when the cowherd men burned the pieces of her body in a fire, the smoke filled the air with a very pleasing fragrance. Ultimately, although Pütanä had desired to kill Kåñëa, she attained the Lord's abode. From this incident we gain the instruction that if one is attached to Kåñëa somehow or other, even as an enemy, one ultimately attains success. What then is to be said of devotees who are naturally attached to Kåñëa in love? When the inhabitants of Vraja heard about the killing of Pütanä and the welfare of the child, they were very much satisfied. Nanda Mahäräja took the baby Kåñëa on his lap and was filled with satisfaction."
