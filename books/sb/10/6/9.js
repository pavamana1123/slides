    "translation": "Pütanä Räkñasé's heart was fierce and cruel, but she looked like a very affectionate mother. Thus she resembled a sharp sword in a soft sheath. Although seeing her within the room, Yaçodä and Rohiëé, overwhelmed by her beauty, did not stop her, but remained silent because she treated the child like a mother.",

Sometimes a beautiful woman is dangerous because everyone, being captivated by external beauty (mäyä-mohita), is unable to understand what is in her mind. Those who are captivated by the beauty of the external energy are called mäyä-mohita. Mohitaà näbhijänäti mäm ebhyaù param avyayam . Here, of course, the two mothers Rohiëé and Yaçodä were not mäyä-mohita, deluded by the external energy, but to develop the pastimes of the Lord, they were captivated by yogamäyä. Such mäyä-moha is the action of yogamäyä."
