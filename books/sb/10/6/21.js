The gopés, and in fact any householders, knew the process for being purified by chanting Vedic hymns. The gopés executed this process first to purify themselves and then to purify the child Kåñëa. One executes the process of aìga-nyäsa and kara-nyäsa simply by drinking a little sip of water and chanting the mantra. The mantra is preceded with the first letter of the name, followed by anusvära and the word namaù: oà namo 'jas taväìghré avyät, maà mano maëimäàs tava jänuné avyät, and so on. By losing Indian culture, Indian householders have forgotten how to execute the aìga-nyäsa and are simply busy in sense gratification, without any advanced knowledge of human civilization."
