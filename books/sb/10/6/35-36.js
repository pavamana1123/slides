    "synonyms": "pütanä—Pütanä, the professional Räkñasé; loka-bäla-ghné—who used to kill human children; räkñasé—the she-demon; rudhira-açanä—simply hankering for blood; jighäàsayä—with the desire to kill Kåñëa (being envious of Kåñëa and having been instructed by Kaàsa); api—still; haraye—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; stanam—her breast; dattvä—after offering; äpa—obtained; sat-gatim—the most elevated position of spiritual existence; kim—what to speak of; punaù—again; çraddhayä—with faith; bhaktyä—by devotion; kåñëäya—unto Lord Kåñëa; paramätmane—who is the Supreme Person; yacchan—offering; priya-tamam—the dearmost; kim—something; nu—indeed; raktäù—those who have an affinity; tat-mätaraù—Kåñëa's affectionate mothers (offering the beloved child their breasts); yathä—exactly like.",
    "translation": "Pütanä was always hankering for the blood of human children, and with that desire she came to kill Kåñëa; but because she offered her breast to the Lord, she attained the greatest achievement. What then is to be said of those who had natural devotion and affection for Kåñëa as mothers and who offered Him their breasts to suck or offered something very dear, as a mother offers something to a child?",

            "content": "Pütanä had no affection for Kåñëa; rather, she was envious and wanted to kill Him. Nonetheless, because with or without knowledge she offered her breast, she attained the highest achievement in life. But the offerings of devotees attracted to Kåñëa in parental love are always sincere. A mother likes to offer something to her child with affection and love; there is no question of envy. So here we can make a comparative study. If Pütanä could attain such an exalted position in spiritual life by neglectfully, enviously making an offering to Kåñëa, what is to be said of mother Yaçodä and the other gopés, who served Kåñëa with such great affection and love, offering everything for Kåñëa's satisfaction? The gopés automatically achieved the highest perfection. Therefore Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu recommended the affection of the gopés, either in maternal affection or in conjugal love, as the highest perfection in life (ramyä käcid upäsanä vrajavadhü-vargeëa yä kalpitä)."
