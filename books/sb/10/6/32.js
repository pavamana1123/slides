    "translation": "Nanda Mahäräja and the other gopas exclaimed: My dear friends, you must know that Änakadundubhi, Vasudeva, has become a great saint or a master of mystic power. Otherwise how could he have foreseen this calamity and predicted it to us?",

By studying the political situation, Vasudeva could see what would happen, whereas Nanda Mahäräja, the king of the agriculturalists, could only guess that Vasudeva was a great saintly person and had developed mystic powers. Vasudeva actually had all mystic powers under his control; otherwise he could not have become the father of Kåñëa. But in fact he foresaw the calamities in Vraja by studying Kaàsa's political activities and thus warned Nanda Mahäräja to take precautions, although Nanda Mahäräja thought that Vasudeva had predicted this incident through wonderful mystic powers. By mystic powers gained through the practice of haöha-yoga, one can study and understand the future."
