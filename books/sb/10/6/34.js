    "translation": "Because of Kåñëa's having sucked the breast of the Räkñasé Pütanä, when Kåñëa killed her she was immediately freed of all material contamination. Her sinful reactions automatically vanished, and therefore when her gigantic body was being burnt, the smoke emanating from her body was fragrant like aguru incense.",

If one somehow or other becomes Kåñëa conscious by applying his senses in the service of the Lord, one is immediately freed from material contamination. Çåëvatäà sva-kathäù kåñëaù puëya-çravaëa-kértanaù ). Bhaktir ucyate: this is called bhakti. When Pütanä was somehow or other, directly or indirectly, induced to render some service to the Lord by feeding Him with her breast, she was immediately purified, so much so that when her nasty material body was burnt to ashes, it gave off the fragrance of aguru, the most agreeably scented herb."
