First of all, the cowherd men had never before seen such a gigantic body in Våndävana, and therefore they were struck with wonder. Then they began to consider where such a body had come from, whether it had dropped from the sky, or whether, by some mistake or by the power of some mystic yoginé, they had come to some place other than Våndävana. They could not actually guess what had happened, and therefore they were struck with wonder."
