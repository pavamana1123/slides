Therefore there was no need for anxiety about Gokula while the Supreme Personality of Godhead was personally present.",

Mahäräja Parékñit was a devotee of Kåñëa, and therefore when he understood that Pütanä was causing disturbances in Gokula, he was somewhat perturbed. Çukadeva Gosvämé therefore assured him that there was no danger in Gokula. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has sung: nämäçraya kari' yatane tumi, thäkaha äpana käje. Everyone is thus advised to seek shelter in the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra and remain engaged in his own occupational duty. There is no loss in this, and the gain is tremendous. Even from a material point of view, everyone should take to chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra to be saved from all kinds of danger. This world is full of danger (padaà padaà yad vipadäm ). Therefore we should be encouraged to chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra so that in our family, society, neighborhood and nation, everything will be smooth and free from danger."
