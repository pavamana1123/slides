    "translation": "O Mahäräja Parékñit, best of the Kurus, Nanda Mahäräja was very liberal and simple. He immediately took his son Kåñëa on his lap as if Kåñëa had returned from death, and by formally smelling his son's head, Nanda Mahäräja undoubtedly enjoyed transcendental bliss.",

He did not understand that Kåñëa had wanted to kill Pütanä and that His pastimes were performed by yogamäyä. Nanda Mahäräja simply thought that someone had entered his house and created havoc. This was Nanda Mahäräja's simplicity."
