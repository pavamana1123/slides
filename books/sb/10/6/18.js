Although the Räkñasé Pütanä could increase or decrease her bodily size by her mystic abilities and thus gain proportionate power, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is equally powerful in any transcendental form. Kåñëa is the real Personality of Godhead because whether as a child or as a grown-up young man, He is the same person. He does not need to become powerful by meditation or any other external endeavor. Therefore when the greatly powerful Pütanä expanded her body, Kåñëa remained the same small child and fearlessly played on the upper portion of her breast. Ñaòaiçvarya-pürëa. Bhagavän, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always full in all potencies, regardless of whether He is present in this form or that. His potencies are always full. Paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate . He can display all potencies under any circumstances."
