    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is always situated within the core of the heart of the pure devotee, and He is always offered prayers by such worshipable personalities as Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva. Because Kåñëa embraced Pütanä's body with great pleasure and sucked her breast, although she was a great witch, she attained the position of a mother in the transcendental world and thus achieved the highest perfection. What then is to be said of the cows whose nipples Kåñëa sucked with great pleasure and who offered their milk very jubilantly with affection exactly like that of a mother?",

            "content": "These verses explain how devotional service rendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whether directly or indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly, becomes successful. Pütanä was neither a devotee nor a nondevotee; she was actually a demoniac witch instructed by Kaàsa to kill Kåñëa. Nonetheless, in the beginning she assumed the form of a very beautiful woman and approached Kåñëa exactly like an affectionate mother, so that mother Yaçodä and Rohiëé did not doubt her sincerity. The Lord took all this into consideration, and thus she was automatically promoted to a position like that of mother Yaçodä. As explained by Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, there are various roles one may play in such a position. Pütanä was immediately promoted to Vaikuëöhaloka, which is also sometimes described as Svarga. The Svarga mentioned in this verse is not the material heavenly planet, but the transcendental world. In Vaikuëöhaloka, Pütanä attained the position of a nurse (dhätry-ucitäm), as described by Uddhava. Pütanä was elevated to the position of a nurse and maidservant in Goloka Våndävana to assist mother Yaçodä."
