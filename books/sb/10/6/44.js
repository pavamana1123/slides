Therefore this verse uses the word adbhutam, meaning \"specifically wonderful.\" Kåñëa has left us many wonderful narrations about Him. Simply by reading these narrations, as they are described in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one gains salvation from this material world and gradually develops attachment to and devotion for Govinda, Adi-puruña."
