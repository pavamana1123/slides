    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the bestower of many benedictions, including liberation [kaivalya], or oneness with the Brahman effulgence. For that Personality of Godhead, the gopés always felt maternal love, and Kåñëa sucked their breasts with full satisfaction. Therefore, because of their relationship as mother and son, although the gopés were engaged in various family activities, one should never think that they returned to this material world after leaving their bodies.",

            "content": "The advantage of Kåñëa consciousness is described herein. Kåñëa consciousness gradually develops on the transcendental platform. One may think of Kåñëa as the supreme personality, one may think of Kåñëa as the supreme master, one may think of Kåñëa as the supreme friend, one may think of Kåñëa as the supreme son, or one may think of Kåñëa as the supreme conjugal lover. If one is connected with Kåñëa in any of these transcendental relationships, the course of one's material life is understood to have already ended. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä , tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti mäm eti: for such devotees, going back home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. Na punaù kalpate räjan saàsäro jïäna-sambhavaù. This verse also guarantees that devotees who constantly think of Kåñëa in a particular relationship will never return to this material world. In this material world of saàsära, there are the same relationships. One thinks, \"Here is my son,\" \"Here is my wife,\" \"Here is my lover,\" or \"Here is my friend.\" But these relationships are temporary illusions. Ajïäna-sambhavaù: such a consciousness awakens in ignorance. But when the same relationships awaken in Kåñëa consciousness, one's spiritual life is revived, and one is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead. Even though the gopés who were friends of Rohiëé and mother Yaçodä and who allowed their breasts to be sucked by Kåñëa were not directly Kåñëa's mothers, they all had the same chance as Rohiëé and Yaçodä to go back to Godhead and act as Kåñëa's mothers-in-law, servants and so on. The word saàsära refers to attachment for one's body, home, husband or wife, and children, but although the gopés and all the other inhabitants of Våndävana had the same affection and attachment for husband and home, their central affection was for Kåñëa in some transcendental relationship, and therefore they were guaranteed to be promoted to Goloka Våndävana in the next life, to live with Kåñëa eternally in spiritual happiness. The easiest way to attain spiritual elevation, to be liberated from this material world, and to go back home, back to Godhead, is recommended by Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura: kåñëera saàsära kara chäòi' anäcära. One should give up all sinful activities and remain in the family of Kåñëa. Then one's liberation is guaranteed."
