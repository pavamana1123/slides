While they were enjoying their picnic, Aghäsura, the younger brother of Pütanä and Bakäsura, appeared there, desiring to kill Kåñëa and His companions. The demon, who had been sent by Kaàsa, assumed the form of a python, expanding himself to a length of eight miles and the height of a mountain, his mouth seeming to extend from the surface of the earth to the heavenly planets. Having assumed this feature, Aghäsura lay on the road. Kåñëa's friends, the cowherd boys, thought that the demon's form was one of the beautiful spots of Våndävana. Thus they wanted to enter within the mouth of this gigantic python. The gigantic figure of the python became a subject for their sporting pleasure, and they began to laugh, confident that even if this figure were dangerous, Kåñëa was there to protect them. In this way, they proceeded toward the mouth of the gigantic figure."

Kåñëa was waiting outside, and Aghäsura was waiting for Kåñëa, thinking that as soon as Kåñëa entered he would close his mouth so that everyone would die. While waiting for Kåñëa, he refrained from swallowing the boys. In the meantime, Kåñëa was thinking of how to save the boys and kill Aghäsura. Thus He entered the mouth of the gigantic asura, and when He was within the demon's mouth along with His friends, He expanded His body to such an extent that the asura suffocated and died. After this, Kåñëa, by casting His nectarean glance upon His friends, brought them back to life, and with pleasure they all came out unhurt. Thus Kåñëa encouraged all the demigods, and they expressed their pleasure and happiness. For a crooked, sinful person there is no scope for säyujya-mukti, or becoming one with the effulgence of Kåñëa, but because the Supreme Personality of Godhead entered the body of Aghäsura, by His touch this demon got the opportunity to merge into the existence of the Brahman effulgence and thus attain säyujya-mukti."

One year later, when He was six years old and He stepped into the paugaëòa age, this pastime was disclosed to the inhabitants of Vraja. Parékñit Mahäräja inquired, \"Why is it that this pastime was disclosed only after one year and yet the inhabitants of Vraja thought that it had been performed that very day?\" With this question, the Twelfth Chapter ends."
