We may speak of hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, billions, trillions, tens of trillions, and so on, but when we go further to speak of numbers impossible for us to count, we are speaking of unlimited numbers. Such unlimited numbers are indicated here by the word asaìkhyätaiù. Kåñëa is unlimited, His potency is unlimited, His cows and calves are unlimited, and His space is unlimited. Therefore He is described in Bhagavad-gétä as Parabrahman. The word brahman means \"unlimited,\" and Kåñëa is the Supreme Unlimited, Parabrahman. Therefore, we should not consider the statements of this verse to be mythological. They are factual, but inconceivable. Kåñëa can accommodate an unlimited number of calves and an unlimited measurement of space. This is neither mythological nor false, but if we study Kåñëa's potency with our limited knowledge, that potency will never be possible to understand. Ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi na bhaved grähyam indriyaiù . Our senses cannot perceive how He could keep an unlimited number of calves and cows and have unlimited space in which to do so. But this is answered in the Båhad-bhägavatämåta:"
