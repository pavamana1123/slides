    "translation": "Yogés may undergo severe austerities and penances for many births by practicing yama, niyama, äsana and präëäyäma, none of which are easily performed. Yet in due course of time, when these yogés attain the perfection of controlling the mind, they will still be unable to taste even a particle of dust from the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. What then can we describe about the great fortune of the inhabitants of Vrajabhümi, Våndävana, with whom the Supreme Personality of Godhead personally lived and who saw the Lord face to face?",
