    "translation": "Kåñëa saw that all the cowherd boys, who did not know anyone but Him as their Lord, had now gone out of His hand and were helpless, having entered like straws into the fire of the abdomen of Aghäsura, who was death personified. It was intolerable for Kåñëa to be separated from His friends the cowherd boys. Therefore, as if seeing that this had been arranged by His internal potency, Kåñëa was momentarily struck with wonder and unsure of what to do.",
