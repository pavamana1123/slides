    "translation": "Kåñëa is the cause of all causes. The causes and effects of the material world, both higher and lower, are all created by the Supreme Lord, the original controller. When Kåñëa appeared as the son of Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä, He did so by His causeless mercy. Consequently, for Him to exhibit His unlimited opulence was not at all wonderful. Indeed, He showed such great mercy that even Aghäsura, the most sinful miscreant, was elevated to being one of His associates and achieving särüpya-mukti, which is actually impossible for materially contaminated persons to attain.",

            "content": "The word mäyä is also used in connection with love. Out of mäyä, love, a father has affection for his child. Therefore the word mäyinaù indicates that Kåñëa, out of love, appeared as the son of Nanda Mahäräja and assumed the form of a human child (manujärbha). Kåñëa is the cause of all causes. He is the creator of cause and effect, and He is the supreme controller. Nothing is impossible for Him. Therefore, that He enabled even a living being like Aghäsura to attain the salvation of särüpya-mukti was not at all wonderful for Kåñëa. Kåñëa took pleasure in entering the mouth of Aghäsura in a sporting spirit along with His associates. Therefore, when Aghäsura, by that sporting association, as maintained in the spiritual world, was purified of all contamination, he attained särüpya-mukti and vimukti by the grace of Kåñëa. For Kåñëa this was not at all wonderful."
