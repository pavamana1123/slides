    "translation": "This incident of Kåñëa's saving Himself and His associates from death and of giving deliverance to Aghäsura, who had assumed the form of a python, took place when Kåñëa was five years old. It was disclosed in Vrajabhümi after one year, as if it had taken place on that very day.",

In the material world there are birth, death, old age and disease, but in the spiritual world there are no such things because everything is eternal. As for the python, however, by the association of Kåñëa and His devotees, Aghäsura also achieved the same facility of eternal life. Therefore, as indicated here by the word ätmähi-mokñaëam, if the python Aghäsura could receive eternal association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, what is to be said of those who are already associates of the Lord? Säkaà vijahruù kåta-puëya-puïjäù . Here is proof that God is good for everyone. Even when He kills someone, the one who is killed attains liberation. What then is to be said of those who are already in the association of the Lord?"
