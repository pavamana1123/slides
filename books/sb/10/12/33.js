    "translation": "From the body of the gigantic python, a glaring effulgence came out, illuminating all directions, and stayed individually in the sky until Kåñëa came out from the corpse's mouth. Then, as all the demigods looked on, this effulgence entered into Kåñëa's body.",

Entering the body of Kåñëa is called säyujya-mukti, but later verses prove that Aghäsura, like Dantavakra and others, received särüpya-mukti. This has been broadly described by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura with references from the Vaiñëava-toñaëé of Çréla Jéva Gosvämé. Aghäsura attained särüpya-mukti, being promoted to the Vaikuëöha planets to live with the same four-armed bodily features as Viñëu. The explanation of how this is so may be summarized as follows."

One may doubt that such a demon, full of mischievous activities, could attain the liberation of särüpya or säyujya, and one may be astonished about this. But Kåñëa is so kind that in order to drive away such doubts, He had the effulgence, the individual life of the python, wait for some time in its individuality, in the presence of all the demigods."

            "content": "Kåñëa is the full effulgence, and every living being is part and parcel of that effulgence. As proved here, the effulgence in every living being is individual. For some time, the effulgence remained outside the demon's body, individually, and did not mix with the whole effulgence, the brahmajyoti. The Brahman effulgence is not visible to material eyes, but to prove that every living being is individual, Kåñëa had this individual effulgence stay outside the demon's body for some time, for everyone to see. Then Kåñëa proved that anyone killed by Him attains liberation, whether säyujya, särüpya, sämépya or whatever."

            "content": "But the liberation of those who are on the transcendental platform of love and affection is vimukti, special liberation. Thus the serpent first entered the body of Kåñëa personally and mixed with the Brahman effulgence. This merging is called säyujya-mukti. But from later verses we find that Aghäsura attained särüpya-mukti. Text 38 explains that Aghäsura attained a body exactly like that of Viñëu, and the verse after that also clearly states that he attained a completely spiritual body like that of Näräyaëa. Therefore in two or three places the Bhägavatam has confirmed that Aghäsura attained särüpya-mukti. One may then argue, How is it that he mixed with the Brahman effulgence? The answer is that as Jaya and Vijaya, after three births, again attained särüpya-mukti and association with the Lord, Aghäsura received a similar liberation."
