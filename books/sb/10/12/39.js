    "translation": "If even only once or even by force one brings the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead into one's mind, one can attain the supreme salvation by the mercy of Kåñëa, as did Aghäsura. What then is to be said of those whose hearts the Supreme Personality of Godhead enters when He appears as an incarnation, or those who always think of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the source of transcendental bliss for all living entities and by whom all illusion is completely removed?",

Those who are devotees always engage in glorifying Kåñëa. Advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam: (BS 5.33) when we speak of Kåñëa, we refer to all His avatäras, such as Kåñëa, Govinda, Näräyaëa, Viñëu, Lord Caitanya, Kåñëa-Balaräma and Çyämasundara. One who always thinks of Kåñëa must attain vimukti, special salvation as the Lord's personal associate, not necessarily in Våndävana, but at least in Vaikuëöha. This is called särüpya-mukti."
