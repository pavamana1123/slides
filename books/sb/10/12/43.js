Parékñit Mahäräja placed himself as kñatra-bandhavaù, which means \"the lowest of the kñatriyas.\" The qualities of the kñatriya are described in Bhagavad-gétä, and although the general quality of the kñatriya is éçvara-bhäva, the tendency to rule, a kñatriya is not supposed to rule over a brähmaëa. Thus Mahäräja Parékñit regretted that he had wanted to rule over the brähmaëas and had therefore been cursed. He considered himself the lowest of the kñatriyas. Dänam éçvara-bhävaç ca kñätraà karma svabhävajam . There was no doubt that Mahäräja Parékñit had the good qualities of a kñatriya, but as a devotee he presented himself, with submissiveness and humility, as the lowest of the kñatriyas, remembering his act of wrapping a dead serpent around the neck of a brähmaëa. A student and disciple has the right to ask the guru about any confidential service, and it is the duty of the guru to explain these confidential matters to his disciple."
