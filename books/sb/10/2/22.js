It is said that a cruel person like a butcher is advised not to live and not to die. While living, a cruel person creates a hellish condition for his next birth, and therefore he should not live; but he is also advised not to die, because after death he must go to the darkest region of hell. Thus in either circumstance he is condemned. Kaàsa, therefore, having good sense about the science of the soul's transmigration, deliberately refrained from killing Devaké."

Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, in his Vaiñëava-toñaëé-öékä, says: tatra tanu-mäninaù päpina iti dehätma-buddhyaiva päpäbhiniveço bhavati. One who lives in the bodily concept, thinking, \"I am this body,\" involves himself, by the very nature of this conception, in a life of sinful activities. Anyone living in such a conception is to be considered a candidate for hell."

Such a person can do anything sinful to eat, drink, be merry and enjoy a life of sense gratification, not knowing of the soul's transmigration from one body to another. Such a person does whatever he likes, whatever he imagines, and therefore, being subject to the laws of nature, he suffers miserably again and again in different material bodies."

            "content": "Although the body is temporary, it always gives one trouble in many ways, but human civilization is now unfortunately based on tanu-mäné, the bodily concept of life, by which one thinks, \"I belong to this nation,\" \"I belong to this group,\" \"I belong to that group,\" and so on. Each of us has his own ideas, and we are becoming increasingly involved, individually, socially, communally and nationally, in the complexities of karmänubandha, sinful activities. For the maintenance of the body, men are killing so many other bodies and becoming implicated in karmänubandha. Therefore Çréla Jéva Gosvämé says that tanu-mäné, those in the bodily concept of life, are päpé, sinful persons. For such sinful persons, the ultimate destination is the darkest region of hellish life (gantä tamo 'ndham). In particular, a person who wants to maintain his body by killing animals is most sinful and cannot understand the value of spiritual life. In Bhagavad-gétä  the Lord says:"
