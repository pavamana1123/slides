            "content": "Because Kåñëa and His energy appeared simultaneously, people have generally formed two groups—the çäktas and the Vaiñëavas—and sometimes there is rivalry between them. Essentially, those who are interested in material enjoyment are çäktas, and those interested in spiritual salvation and attaining the spiritual kingdom are Vaiñëavas. Because people are generally interested in material enjoyment, they are interested in worshiping Mäyädevé, the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vaiñëavas, however, are çuddha-çäktas, or pure bhaktas, because the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra indicates worship of the Supreme Lord's energy, Harä. A Vaiñëava prays to the energy of the Lord for the opportunity to serve the Lord along with His spiritual energy. Thus Vaiñëavas all worship such Deities as Rädhä-Kåñëa, Sétä-Räma, Lakñmé-Näräyaëa and Rukmiëé-Dvärakädhéça, whereas durgä-çäktas worship the material energy under different names."

In Väräëasé she is known as Durgä, in Avanté she is known as Bhadrakälé, in Orissa she is known as Vijayä, and in Kulahäpura she is known as Vaiñëavé or Mahälakñmé. (The representatives of Mahälakñmé and Ambikä are present in Bombay.) In the country known as Kämarüpa she is known as Caëòikä, in Northern India as Çäradä, and in Cape Comorin as Kanyakä. Thus she is distributed according to various names in various places."

Mäyä is known as Durgä because she is approached with great difficulty, as Bhadrä because she is auspicious, and as Kälé because she is deep blue. Because she is the most powerful energy, she is known as Vijayä; because she is one of the different energies of Viñëu, she is known as Vaiñëavé; and because she enjoys in this material world and gives facilities for material enjoyment, she is known as Kumudä. Because she is very severe to her enemies, the asuras, she is known as Caëòikä, and because she gives all sorts of material facilities, she is called Kåñëä. In this way the material energy is differently named and situated in different places on the surface of the globe."
