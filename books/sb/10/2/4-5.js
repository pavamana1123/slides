    "translation": "Some of their relatives, however, began to follow Kaàsa's principles and act in his service. After Kaàsa, the son of Ugrasena, killed the six sons of Devaké, a plenary portion of Kåñëa entered her womb as her seventh child, arousing her pleasure and her lamentation. That plenary portion is celebrated by great sages as Ananta, who belongs to Kåñëa's second quadruple expansion.",

            "content": "Some of the chief devotees, such as Akrüra, stayed with Kaàsa to satisfy him. This they did for various purposes. They all expected the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear as the eighth child as soon as Devaké's other children were killed by Kaàsa, and they were eagerly awaiting His appearance. By remaining in Kaàsa's association, they would be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead take birth and display His childhood pastimes, and Akrüra would later go to Våndävana to bring Kåñëa and Balaräma to Mathurä. The word paryupäsate is significant because it indicates that some devotees wanted to stay near Kaàsa in order to see all these pastimes of the Lord. The six children killed by Kaàsa had formerly been sons of Maréci, but because of having been cursed by a brähmaëa, they were obliged to take birth as grandsons of Hiraëyakaçipu. Kaàsa had taken birth as Kälanemi, and now he was obliged to kill his own sons. This was a mystery. As soon as the sons of Devaké were killed, they would return to their original place. The devotees wanted to see this also. Generally speaking, no one kills his own nephews, but Kaàsa was so cruel that he did so without hesitation. Ananta, Saìkarñaëa, belongs to the second catur-vyüha, or quadruple expansion. This is the opinion of experienced commentators."
