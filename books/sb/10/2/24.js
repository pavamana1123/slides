In other words, by thinking of his all-pervading enemy, Kaàsa became unfavorably Kåñëa conscious.",

If one can understand the position of the living entity as a separated portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by studying the nature of the living entity one can understand the nature of the Supreme Godhead, since the living entity is a fragmental sample of the Godhead. But because atheists are not interested in God consciousness, they try to be happy by cultivating Kåñëa consciousness in various unfavorable ways."

A devotee, however, whether sitting on a throne or beneath a tree, is always happy. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé resigned from office as a government minister to sit beneath a tree, yet he was happy. Tyaktvä türëam açeña-maëòalapati-çreëéà sadä tucchavat (Ñaò-gosvämy-añöaka 4). He did not care for his comfortable position as minister; he was happy even beneath a tree in Våndävana, favorably serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. For a nondevotee, the world is full of problems, whereas for a devotee the entire world is full of happiness."
