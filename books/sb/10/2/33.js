Thus even if devotees fall down, they are still strong enough to traverse the heads of their enemies. We have actually seen that our Kåñëa consciousness movement has many opponents, such as the \"deprogrammers,\" who instituted a strong legal case against the devotees. We thought that this case would take a long time to settle, but because the devotees were protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we unexpectedly won the case in one day. Thus a case that was expected to continue for years was settled in a day because of the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has promised in Bhagavad-gétä ). But even if a devotee circumstantially falls down, he is protected by Mädhava."

The opulences of a devotee are not a result of karma-käëòa-vicära. A devotee is always protected by all of the Supreme Lord's opulences, of which no one can deprive him (teñäà nityäbhiyuktänäà yoga-kñemaà vahämy aham ). Thus a devotee cannot be defeated by any opponents. A devotee, therefore, should not deviate knowingly from the path of devotion. The adherent devotee is assured all protection from the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
