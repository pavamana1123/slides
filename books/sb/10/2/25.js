Kaàsa, being an asura, was always planning how to kill the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His mother, Devaké. Thus he was also Kåñëa conscious. But devotees are Kåñëa conscious favorably (viñëu-bhaktaù småto daivaù). Brahmä is so powerful that he is in charge of creating an entire universe, yet he personally came to receive the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhava, Lord Çiva, is always jubilant in chanting the holy name of the Lord. And what to speak of Närada? Närada-muni, bäjäya véëä, rädhikä-ramaëa-näme. Närada Muni is always chanting the glories of the Lord, and his engagement is to travel all over the universe and find a devotee or make someone a devotee. Even a hunter was made a devotee by the grace of Närada. Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, in his Toñaëé, says that the word närada-ädibhiù means that Närada and the demigods were accompanied by other saintly persons, like Sanaka and Sanätana, all of whom came to congratulate or welcome the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even though Kaàsa was planning to kill Devaké, he too awaited the arrival of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (pratékñaàs taj janma)."
