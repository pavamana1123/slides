The fact is that everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, manifested in varieties of energy. Ekam evädvitéyaà brahma. There is no second existence. Those who are truly vipaçcit, learned, are those who have reached the platform of understanding and observing the Supreme Personality of Godhead in any condition of life. premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti (BS 5.38). Learned devotees accept even conditions of distress as representing the presence of the Supreme Lord. When a devotee is in distress, he sees that the Lord has appeared as distress just to relieve or purify the devotee from the contamination of the material world. While one is within this material world, one is in various conditions, and therefore a devotee sees a condition of distress as but another feature of the Lord. Tat te'nukampäà susamékñamäëaù . The appearance of distress is a negative process intended to give the devotee relief from this material world, which is called måtyu-saàsära, or the constant repetition of birth and death. To save a surrendered soul from repeated birth and death, the Lord purifies him of contamination by offering him a little distress. This cannot be understood by a nondevotee, but a devotee can see this because he is vipaçcit, or learned. A nondevotee, therefore, is perturbed in distress, but a devotee welcomes distress as another feature of the Lord. Sarvaà khalv idaà brahma. A devotee can actually see that there is only the Supreme Personality of Godhead and no second entity. Ekam evädvitéyam. There is only the Lord, who presents Himself in different energies."

Simply by surrendering oneself at the lotus feet of Kåñëa, one can completely discharge one's duties; there is no need to worship various deities or demigods. These various divinities are observed by the müòhas, fools, who are bewildered by the three modes of material nature (tribhir guëamayair bhävair ebhiù sarvam idaà jagat). Such fools cannot understand that the real source of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead (mohitaà näbhijänäti mäm ebhyaù param avyayam ). Not being disturbed by the Lord's various features, one should concentrate upon and worship the Supreme Lord (mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja). This should be the guiding principle of one's life."
