Human life is meant for God realization, but unfortunately the materialistic civilization is stressing only the senses of the body, not understanding the living force within the body. As clearly stated in Bhagavad-gétä (dehino 'smin yathä dehe , kali-käle näma-rüpe kåñëa-avatära: in this age, Kåñëa has appeared in the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is spreading like wildfire all over the world, and it will go on doing so. Men who are like Kaàsa are very much afraid of the movement's progress and acceptance by the younger generation, but as Kåñëa could not be killed by Kaàsa, this movement cannot be checked by men of Kaàsa's class. The movement will go on increasing more and more, provided the leaders of the movement remain firmly Kåñëa conscious by following the regulative principles and the primary activities of chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra regularly."
