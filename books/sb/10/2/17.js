    "translation": "While carrying the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the core of his heart, Vasudeva bore the Lord's transcendentally illuminating effulgence, and thus he became as bright as the sun. He was therefore very difficult to see or approach through sensory perception. Indeed, he was unapproachable and unperceivable even for such formidable men as Kaàsa, and not only for Kaàsa but for all living entities.",

            "content": "The word dhäma is significant. Dhäma refers to the place where the Supreme Personality of Godhead resides. In the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is said, dhämnä svena sadä nirasta-kuhakaà satyaà paraà dhémahi. In the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no influence of material energy (dhämnä svena sadä nirasta-kuhakam). Any place where the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present by His name, form, qualities or paraphernalia immediately becomes a dhäma. For example, we speak of Våndävana-dhäma, Dvärakä-dhäma and Mathurä-dhäma because in these places the name, fame, qualities and paraphernalia of the Supreme Godhead are always present. Similarly, if one is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to do something, the core of his heart becomes a dhäma, and thus he becomes so extraordinarily powerful that not only his enemies but also people in general are astonished to observe his activities. Because he is unapproachable, his enemies are simply struck with wonder, as explained here by the words duräsado 'tidurdharsaù."
