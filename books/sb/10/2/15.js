When everyone lamented, Kaàsa joined in compassion, thinking that perhaps because of drugs or some other external means, Devaké had undergone this abortion. The real story of what happened after Yogamäyä attracted the child of Devaké into the womb of Rohiëé in the seventh month of Rohiëé's pregnancy is described as follows in the Hari-vaàça. At midnight, while Rohiëé was deeply sleeping, she experienced, as if in a dream, that she had undergone a miscarriage. After some time, when she awoke, she saw that this had indeed happened, and she was in great anxiety. But Yogamäyä then informed her, \"O auspicious lady, your child is now being replaced. I am attracting a child from the womb of Devaké, and therefore your child will be known as Saìkarñaëa.\""
