            "content": "These are some of the reasons why Balaräma is known as Saìkarñaëa, Balaräma or sometimes Räma. In the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—people sometimes object when Räma is accepted as Balaräma. But although devotees of Lord Räma may object, they should know that there is no difference between Balaräma and Lord Räma. Here Çrémad-Bhägavatam clearly states that Balaräma is also known as Räma (rämeti). Therefore, it is not artificial for us to speak of Lord Balaräma as Lord Räma. Jayadeva Gosvämé also speaks of three Rämas: Paraçuräma, Raghupati Räma and Balaräma. All of them are Rämas."
