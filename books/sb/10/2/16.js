Although unborn, the Lord, the master of everything, appears like a born child by entering the mind of a devotee. The Lord is already there within the mind, and consequently it is not astonishing for Him to appear as if born from a devotee's body. The word äviveça signifies that the Lord appeared within the mind of Vasudeva. There was no need for a discharge of semen. That is the opinion of Çrépäda Çrédhara Svämé and Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura. In the Vaiñëava-toñaëé, Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé says that consciousness was awakened within the mind of Vasudeva. Çréla Véraräghava Äcärya also says that Vasudeva was one of the demigods and that within his mind the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as an awakening of consciousness."
