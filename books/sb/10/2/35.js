Those who are in the modes of material nature, although speculating for thousands of years, cannot understand Him. The Lord has innumerable forms (rämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan (BS 5.39)), and unless these forms, such as Lord Rämacandra, Nåsiàhadeva, Kåñëa and Balaräma, were transcendental, how could they be worshiped by devotees since time immemorial? Bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù . Devotees who awaken their transcendental nature in the presence of the Lord and who follow the rules and regulations of devotional service can understand Lord Kåñëa, Lord Rämacandra and other incarnations, who are not of this material world but who come from the spiritual world for the benefit of people in general. If one does not take to this process, one imagines or manufactures some form of God according to material qualities and can never awaken a real understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù signify that unless one worships the Lord according to the regulative devotional principles, one cannot awaken the transcendental nature. Deity worship, even in the absence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, awakens the transcendental nature of the devotee, who thus becomes increasingly attached to the Lord's lotus feet."

            "content": "The appearance of Kåñëa is the answer to all imaginative iconography of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everyone imagines the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to his mode of material nature. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is said that the Lord is the oldest person. Therefore a section of religionists imagine that God must be very old, and therefore they depict a form of the Lord like a very old man. But in the same Brahma-saàhitä, that is contradicted; although He is the oldest of all living entities, He has His eternal form as a fresh youth. The exact words used in this connection in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam are vijïänam ajïäna-bhidäpamärjanam. Vijïäna means transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Personality; vijïäna is also experienced knowledge. Transcendental knowledge has to be accepted by the descending process of disciplic succession as Brahmä presents the knowledge of Kåñëa in the Brahma-saàhitä. Brahma-saàhitä is vijïäna as realized by Brahmä's transcendental experience, and in that way he presented the form and the pastimes of Kåñëa in the transcendental abode. Ajïäna-bhidä means \"that which can match all kinds of speculation.\" In ignorance, people are imagining the form of the Lord; sometimes He has no form and sometimes He has form, according to their different imaginations. But the presentation of Kåñëa in the Brahma-saàhitä is vijïäna—scientific, experienced knowledge given by Lord Brahmä and accepted by Lord Caitanya. There is no doubt about it. Çré Kåñëa's form, Çré Kåñëa's flute, Kåñëa's color—everything is reality. Here it is said that this vijïänam is always defeating all kinds of speculative knowledge. \"Therefore,\" the demigods prayed, \"without Your appearing as Kåñëa, as You are, neither ajïäna-bhidä (the nescience of speculative knowledge) nor vijïänam would be realized. Ajïäna-bhidäpamärjanam—by Your appearance the speculative knowledge of ignorance will be vanquished, and the real, experienced knowledge of authorities like Lord Brahmä will be established. Men influenced by the three modes of material nature imagine their own God according to the modes of material nature. In this way God is presented in various ways, but Your appearance will establish what the real form of God is.\""

Actually the form of Kåñëa or Näräyaëa is transcendental to any material idea. Even the greatest impersonalist, Çaìkaräcärya, has admitted, näräyaëaù paro 'vyaktät: the material creation is caused by the avyakta, the impersonal manifestation of matter or the nonphenomenal total reservoir of matter, and Kåñëa is transcendental to that material conception. This is expressed in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam as çuddha-sattva, or transcendental. The Lord does not belong to the material mode of goodness, for He is above the position of material goodness. He belongs to the transcendental, eternal status of bliss and knowledge."

Lord Kåñëa is Your name because You are all-attractive; You are called Çyämasundara because of Your transcendental beauty. Çyäma means blackish, yet they say that You are more beautiful than thousands of cupids. Kandarpa-koöi-kamanéya. Although You appear in a color which is compared to that of a blackish cloud, You are the transcendental Absolute, and therefore Your beauty is many, many times more attractive than the delicate body of Cupid. Sometimes You are called Giridhäré because You lifted the hill known as Govardhana. You are sometimes called Nanda-nandana or Väsudeva or Devaké-nandana because You appear as the son of Mahäräja Nanda or Devaké or Vasudeva. Impersonalists think that Your many names or forms are according to a particular type of work and quality because they accept You from the position of a material observer."

Actually, only a person who has a little taste for the service of Your lotus feet can understand Your transcendental nature or form and quality. Others may go on speculating for millions of years, but it is not possible for them to understand even a single part of Your actual position.\" In other words, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, cannot be understood by the nondevotees because there is a curtain of yogamäyä which covers Kåñëa's actual features. As confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä , nähaà prakäçaù sarvasya. The Lord says, \"I am not exposed to anyone and everyone.\" When Kåñëa came, He was actually present on the battlefield of Kurukñetra, and everyone saw Him. But not everyone could understand that He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Still, everyone who died in His presence attained complete liberation from material bondage and was transferred to the spiritual world."

Even big academic scholars, not considering the endeavors of the äcäryas who have recommended devotional service in many elaborate commentaries and notes, think that Kåñëa is fictitious. This is due to a lack of transcendental knowledge and a failure to awaken Kåñëa consciousness. One should have the common sense to ask why, if Kåñëa or Räma were fictitious, stalwart scholars like Çrédhara Svämé, Rüpa Gosvämé, Sanätana Gosvämé, Véraräghava, Vijayadhvaja, Vallabhäcärya and many other recognized äcäryas would have spent so much time to write about Kåñëa in notes and commentaries on Çrémad-Bhägavatam."
