Even big scholars who are nondevotees think that Kåñëa is fictitious. Yet although so-called scholars and commentators do not believe that Kåñëa was factually a historical person whose presence on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra is recorded in the history of Mahäbhärata, they feel compelled to write commentaries on Bhagavad-gétä and other historical records. Sevonmukhe hi jihvädau svayam eva sphuraty adaù: [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.2.234] Kåñëa's transcendental name, form, attributes and activities can be revealed only when one engages in His service in full consciousness. This confirms Kåñëa's own words in Bhagavad-gétä :"

One cannot taste the mango fruit simply by chanting, \"Mango, mango, mango.\" But the devotee who knows that there is no difference between the name and the form of the Lord chants Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, and realizes that he is always in Kåñëa's company."

Since there is no difference between the transcendental name and form of the Lord, there is no difference between the transcendental pastimes and the form of the Lord. For those who are less intelligent (like women, laborers or the mercantile class), the great sage Vyäsadeva wrote Mahäbhärata. In the Mahäbhärata, Kåñëa is present in His different activities. Mahäbhärata is history, and simply by studying, hearing, and memorizing the transcendental activities of Kåñëa, the less intelligent can also gradually rise to the standard of pure devotees."

Because Kåñëa, for the sake of His devotees, lifted Govardhana Hill, the devotees appreciate the Lord's inconceivable strength; but nondevotees, in spite of directly perceiving the Lord's inconceivable strength and power, regard the Lord's activities as fictitious. This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. Nondevotees cannot give any nomenclature for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet the Lord is known as Çyämasundara and Giridhäré. Similarly, the Lord is known as Devaké-nandana and Yaçodä-nandana because He accepted the role of son for mother Devaké and mother Yaçodä, and He is known as Gopäla because He enjoyed the sport of maintaining the cows and calves. Therefore, although He has no mundane name, He is addressed by devotees as Devaké-nandana, Yaçodä-nandana, Gopäla and Çyämasundara. These are all transcendental names that only devotees can appreciate and nondevotees cannot."

Therefore this verse explains, na näma-rüpe guëa janma-karmabhir nirüpitavye tava tasya säkñiëaù. In this connection, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has given the example that persons suffering from jaundice cannot taste the sweetness of sugar candy, although everyone knows that sugar candy is sweet. Similarly, because of the material disease, nondevotees cannot understand the transcendental name, form, attributes and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although they actually see the Lord's activities, either through authority or through history. The Puräëas are old, authentic histories, but nondevotees cannot understand them, especially Çrémad-Bhägavatam, which is the essence of Vedic knowledge. Nondevotees cannot understand even the preliminary study of transcendental knowledge, Bhagavad-gétä. They simply speculate and present commentaries with absurd distortions. In conclusion, unless one elevates himself to the transcendental platform by practicing bhakti-yoga, one cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His name, form, attributes or activities. But if by chance, by the association of devotees, one can actually understand the Lord and His features, one immediately becomes a liberated person. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä :"
