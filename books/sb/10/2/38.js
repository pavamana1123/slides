    "translation": "O Lord, we are fortunate because the heavy burden of the demons upon this earth is immediately removed by Your appearance. Indeed, we are certainly fortunate, for we shall be able to see upon this earth and in the heavenly planets the marks of lotus, conchshell, club and disc that adorn Your lotus feet.",

            "content": "The soles of the Lord's lotus feet are marked with çaìkha-cakra-gadä-padma—conchshell, disc, club and lotus—and also by a flag and a thunderbolt. When Kåñëa walks on this earth or in the heavenly planets, these marks are visible wherever He goes. Våndävana-dhäma is a transcendental place because of Kåñëa's walking on this land frequently. The inhabitants of Våndävana were fortunate to see these marks here and there. When Akrüra went to Våndävana to take Kåñëa and Balaräma away to the festival arranged by Kaàsa, upon seeing the marks of the Lord's lotus feet on the ground of Våndävana, he fell down and began to groan. These marks are visible to devotees who receive the causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (tavänukampitäm). The demigods were jubilant not only because the appearance of the Supreme Lord would do away with the burdensome demons, but also because they would be able to see upon the ground the transcendental marks from the soles of the Lord's lotus feet. The gopés always thought of the Lord's lotus feet when He was walking in the pasturing grounds, and, as described in the previous verse, simply by thinking of the Lord's lotus feet, the gopés were fully absorbed in transcendence (äviñöa-cetä na bhaväya kalpate). Like the gopés, one who is always absorbed in thought of the Lord is beyond the material platform and will not remain in this material world. It is our duty, therefore, always to hear, chant and think about the Lord's lotus feet, as actually done by Vaiñëavas who have decided to live in Våndävana always and think of the Lord's lotus feet twenty-four hours a day."
