    "translation": "O Lord, You are always in full knowledge, and to bring all good fortune to all living entities, You appear in different incarnations, all of them transcendental to the material creation. When You appear in these incarnations, You are pleasing to the pious and religious devotees, but for nondevotees You are the annihilator.",

The incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead all function differently, but their main purpose is pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm —to protect the devotees and annihilate the miscreants. Yet even though the duñkåtés, or miscreants, are annihilated, this is ultimately good for them."
