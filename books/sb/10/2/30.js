According to this verse, Mahäräja Parékñit became liberated by fully concentrating his mind on hearing the Lord's holy name, attributes and pastimes. Similarly, Çukadeva Gosvämé simply glorified the Lord, and by speaking on the subject matters of Kåñëa that constitute the entire Çrémad-Bhägavatam, he too was liberated. One may also be liberated simply by sakhya, friendly behavior with the Lord. Such is the power of devotional service, as we learn from the examples set by the Lord's many pure devotees."
