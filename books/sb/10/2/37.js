Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has said that anyone who has dedicated his life to the service of the Lord (éhä yasya harer däsye) by his activities, his mind and his words (karmaëä manasä girä) may stay in any condition of life (nikhiläsv apy avasthäsu) and yet is no longer actually conditioned but is liberated (jévan-muktaù sa ucyate). Even though such a devotee is in a material body, he has nothing to do with this body, for he is transcendentally situated. Näräyaëa-paräù sarve na kutaçcana bibhyati: because a devotee is engaged in transcendental activities, he is not afraid of being materially embodied.  therefore recommends that one always engage at least in chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra:"

Strictly avoiding such inauspicious association, we should simply hear from pure devotees. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé therefore recommends, çré-guru-padäçrayaù: one must seek shelter at the lotus feet of a pure devotee who can be one's guru. Caitanya Mahäprabhu advises that a guru is one who strictly follows the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä: yare dekha, tare kaha, 'kåñëa'-upadeça . A juggler, a magician or one who speaks nonsense as an academic career is not a guru. Rather, a guru is one who presents Bhagavad-gétä, Kåñëa's instructions, as it is. Çravaëa is very important; one must hear from the Vaiñëava sädhu, guru and çästra."

In our Kåñëa consciousness movement, all our activities are concentrated upon distributing Kåñëa literature. This is very important. One may approach any person and induce him to read Kåñëa literature so that in the future he also may become a devotee. Such activities are recommended in this verse. Kriyäsu yas tvac-caraëäravindayoù. Such activities will always remind the devotees of the Lord's lotus feet. By fully concentrating on distributing books for Kåñëa, one is fully absorbed in Kåñëa. This is samädhi."
