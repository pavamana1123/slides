When äcäryas completely take shelter under Your lotus feet in order to cross the fierce ocean of nescience, they leave behind on earth the method by which they cross, and because You are very merciful to Your other devotees, You accept this method to help them.",

The duty of the guru is to find the means, according to the time, the circumstances and the candidate, by which one can be induced to render devotional service, which Kåñëa accepts from a candidate who wants to be successful in going back home, back to Godhead. After wandering throughout the universe, a fortunate person within this material world seeks shelter of such a guru, or äcärya, who trains the devotee in the suitable ways to render service according to the circumstances so that the Supreme Personality of Godhead will accept the service. This makes it easier for the candidate to reach the ultimate destination. The äcärya's duty, therefore, is to find the means by which devotees may render service according to references from çästra. Rüpa Gosvämé, for example, in order to help subsequent devotees, published such devotional books as Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu. Thus it is the duty of the äcärya to publish books that will help future candidates take up the method of service and become eligible to return home, back to Godhead, by the mercy of the Lord. In our Kåñëa consciousness movement, this same path is being prescribed and followed. Thus the devotees have been advised to refrain from four sinful activities—illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling—and to chant sixteen rounds a day. These are bona fide instructions. Because in the Western countries constant chanting is not possible, one should not artificially imitate Haridäsa Öhäkura, but should follow this method. Kåñëa will accept a devotee who strictly follows the regulative principles and the method prescribed in the various books and literatures published by the authorities. The äcärya gives the suitable method for crossing the ocean of nescience by accepting the boat of the Lord's lotus feet, and if this method is strictly followed, the followers will ultimately reach the destination, by the grace of the Lord. This method is called äcärya-sampradäya. It is therefore said, sampradäya-vihénä ye manträs te niñphalä matäù (Padma Puräëa). The äcärya-sampradäya is strictly bona fide. Therefore one must accept the äcärya-sampradäya; otherwise one's endeavor will be futile. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura therefore sings:"
