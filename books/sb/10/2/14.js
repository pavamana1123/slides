    "translation": "Thus instructed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Yogamäyä immediately agreed. With the Vedic mantra oà, she confirmed that she would do what He asked. Thus having accepted the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, she circumambulated Him and started for the place on earth known as Nanda-gokula. There she did everything just as she had been told.",

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments that oà signifies Vedic confirmation. Thus Yogamäyä very faithfully received the Lord's order as a Vedic injunction. It is a fact that whatever is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is a Vedic injunction that no one should neglect. In Vedic injunctions there are no mistakes, illusions, cheating or imperfection. Unless one understands the authority of the Vedic version, there is no purpose in quoting çästra. No one should violate the Vedic injunctions. Rather, one should strictly execute the orders given in the Vedas. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä :"
