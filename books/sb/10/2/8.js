Does this mean that the Ñaò-garbhäsuras were equal to the transcendental body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The following answer is given by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura."

Everything is an expansion of Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet everything is not the Supreme Godhead, and He is not everywhere. Everything rests upon Him and yet does not rest upon Him. This can be explained only through the acintya-bhedäbheda philosophy. Such truths cannot be understood, however, unless one is a pure devotee, for the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä , bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù: \"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service.\" Even though the Lord cannot be understood by ordinary persons, this principle should be understood from the statement of the çästras."

Thus situated in devotional service, a devotee, although in the material world, is not in the material world. Yet a devotee always fears, \"Because I am associated with the material world, so many contaminations affect me.\" Therefore he is always alert in fear, which gradually diminishes his material association."

A pure devotee should always fear material association, and in this way all the asuras of material association will be killed, as the ñaò-garbhäsuras were killed by Kaàsa. It is said that from the mind, Maréci appears. In other words, Maréci is an incarnation of the mind. Maréci has six sons: Käma, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and Mätsarya (lust, anger, greed, illusion, madness and envy). The Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in pure devotional service. This is confirmed in the Vedas: bhaktir evainaà darçayati. Only bhakti can bring one in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared from the womb of Devaké, and therefore Devaké symbolically represents bhakti, and Kaàsa symbolically represents material fear. When a pure devotee always fears material association, his real position of bhakti is manifested, and he naturally becomes uninterested in material enjoyment. When the six sons of Maréci are killed by such fear and one is freed from material contamination, within the womb of bhakti the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears. Thus the seventh pregnancy of Devaké signifies the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After the six sons Käma, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and Mätsarya are killed, the Çeña incarnation creates a suitable situation for the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, when one awakens his natural Kåñëa consciousness, Lord Kåñëa appears. This is the explanation given by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura."
