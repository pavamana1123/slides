With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.\" Everything is situated as a part of the Supreme Lord's potency. In regard to Lord Kåñëa's appearance in the womb of Devaké, Brahmä played a part also because on the bank of the milk ocean he requested the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear. A part was also played by Baladeva, the first expansion of Godhead. Similarly, Yogamäyä, who appeared as the daughter of mother Yaçodä, also played a part. Thus jéva-tattva, viñëu-tattva and çakti-tattva are all integrated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and when Kåñëa appears, He appears with all His integrated parts. As explained in previous verses, Yogamäyä was requested to attract Saìkarñaëa, Baladeva, from the womb of Devaké to the womb of Rohiëé, and this was a very heavy task for her. Yogamäyä naturally could not see how it was possible for her to attract Saìkarñaëa. Therefore Kåñëa addressed her as çubhe, auspicious, and said, \"Be blessed. Take power from Me, and you will be able to do it.\" By the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, anyone can do anything, for the Lord is present in everything, all things being His parts and parcels (aàça-bhägena) and increasing or decreasing by His supreme will. Balaräma was only fifteen days older than Kåñëa. By the blessings of Kåñëa, Yogamäyä became the daughter of mother Yaçodä, but by the supreme will she was not able to enjoy the parental love of her father and mother. Kåñëa, however, although not actually born from the womb of mother Yaçodä, enjoyed the parental love of mother Yaçodä and Nanda. By the blessings of Kåñëa, Yogamäyä was able to achieve the reputation of being the daughter of mother Yaçodä, who also became famous by the blessings of Kåñëa. Yaçodä means \"one who gives fame.\""
