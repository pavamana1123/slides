    "translation": "Thereafter, accompanied by plenary expansions, the fully opulent Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is all-auspicious for the entire universe, was transferred from the mind of Vasudeva to the mind of Devaké. Devaké, having thus been initiated by Vasudeva, became beautiful by carrying Lord Kåñëa, the original consciousness for everyone, the cause of all causes, within the core of her heart, just as the east becomes beautiful by carrying the rising moon.",

We should note carefully that the Lord was transferred to Devaké not by the ordinary way for a human being, but by dékñä, initiation. Thus the importance of initiation is mentioned here. Unless one is initiated by the right person, who always carries within his heart the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one cannot acquire the power to carry the Supreme Godhead within the core of one's own heart."

The Supreme Godhead is never separated from His personal opulences. As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38), rämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan: the Lord is always situated with all His plenary expansions, such as Räma, Nåsiàha and Varäha. Therefore the word acyutäàçam is specifically used here, signifying that the Lord is always present with His plenary expansions and opulences. There is no need to think of the Lord artificially as yogés do. Dhyänävasthita-tad-gatena manasä paçyanti yaà yoginaù . Yogés meditate upon the Supreme person within the mind. For a devotee, however, the Lord is present, and His presence need only be awakened through initiation by a bona fide spiritual master. The Lord did not need to live within the womb of Devaké, for His presence within the core of her heart was sufficient to carry Him. One is here forbidden to think that Kåñëa was begotten by Vasudeva within the womb of Devaké and that she carried the child within her womb."

The form of the Lord situated in the pure, unalloyed heart of Vasudeva is not different from the original form of Kåñëa. The appearance of the form of Kåñëa anywhere, and specifically within the heart, is called dhäma. Dhäma refers not only to Kåñëa's form, but to His name, His form, His quality and His paraphernalia. Everything becomes manifest simultaneously."

When Kåñëa is there, it is to be understood that all His plenary expansions, such as Näräyaëa, and incarnations like Lord Nåsiàha and Varäha, are with Him, and they are not subject to the conditions of material existence. In this way, Devaké became the residence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is one without a second and the cause of all creation. Devaké became the residence of the Absolute Truth, but because she was within the house of Kaàsa, she looked just like a suppressed fire, or like misused education. When fire is covered by the walls of a pot or is kept in a jug, the illuminating rays of the fire cannot be very much appreciated. Similarly, misused knowledge, which does not benefit the people in general, is not very much appreciated. So Devaké was kept within the prison walls of Kaàsa's palace, and no one could see her transcendental beauty, which resulted from her conceiving the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
