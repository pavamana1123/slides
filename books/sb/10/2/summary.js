Therefore, the members of the Yadu dynasty left their homes and sought shelter in such states as Kuru, Païcäla, Kekaya, Çälva and Vidarbha. Only some of them stayed with Kaàsa, as nominal friends."

The Lord Himself, who was soon to appear as the eighth son of Devaké, ordered Yogamäyä to take birth from the womb of Yaçodädevé. Because Kåñëa and His potency, Yogamäyä, appeared simultaneously as brother and sister, the world is full of Vaiñëavas and çäktas, and there is certainly some rivalry between them. Vaiñëavas worship the Supreme Lord, whereas çäktas, according to their desires, worship Yogamäyä in forms like Durgä, Bhadrakälé and Caëòikä. Following the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Yogamäyä transferred Baladeva, Saìkarñaëa, the seventh child of Devaké, from the womb of Devaké to the womb of Rohiëé. Because Saìkarñaëa appears in order to increase love of Kåñëa, He is known as Baladeva. One may take auspicious strength from Him to become a devotee of the Lord, and therefore He is also known as Balabhadra."

Because the Lord was present in her heart, Devaké, as her pregnancy continued, appeared effulgent. Upon seeing this effulgence, Kaàsa was full of anxiety, but he could not harm Devaké because of their family relationship. Thus he began indirectly thinking of Kåñëa and became fully Kåñëa conscious."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, they said, is eternally the Absolute Truth. The spiritual soul is more important than the gross body, and the Supersoul, Paramätmä, is still more important than the soul. The Supreme Godhead is absolutely independent, and His incarnations are transcendental. The prayers of the demigods glorify and exalt devotees and explain the fate of persons who superficially consider themselves liberated from the conditions of material nature. A devotee is always safe. When a devotee fully surrenders at the lotus feet of the Lord, he is completely liberated from the fear of material existence. By explaining why the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends, the prayers of the demigods clearly confirm the Lord's statement in Bhagavad-gétä :"
