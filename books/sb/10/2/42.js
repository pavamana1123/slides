There is no limit to the Lord's incarnations, but they can be perceived only by devotees who are fortunate. The devatäs, the demigods, fortunately understood the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus they offered their prayers. Then Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä led the demigods in returning to their homes."

Since it was said at first that Kåñëa was present within the heart of Vasudeva and was transferred to the heart of Devaké, Çré Jéva Gosvämé writes, how is it that Kåñëa was now in the womb? He replies that there is no contradiction. From the heart the Lord can go to the womb, or from the womb He can go to the heart. Indeed, He can go or stay anywhere. As confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38), aëòäntara-stha-paramäëu-cayäntara-sthaà govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi. The Lord can stay wherever He likes. Devaké, therefore, in accordance with the desire of her former life, now had the opportunity to seek the benediction of having the Supreme Personality of Godhead as her son, Devaké-nandana."
