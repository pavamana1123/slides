The Lord, taking His wife Satyabhämä with Him, then rode on Garuòa to Prägyotiña-pura, which was surrounded on all sides by fortifications consisting of hills, unmanned weapons, water, fire and wind, and by obstructions of mura-päça wire.",

Çréla Çrédhara Svämé begins by saying that the Lord wanted to give His adventurous wife a novel experience and thus took her to the scene of this extraordinary battle. Also, Lord Kåñëa had once granted the blessing to Bhümi, the earth-goddess, that He would not kill her demoniac son without her permission. Since Bhümi is an expansion of Satyabhämä, the latter could authorize Kåñëa to do the needful with the unusually nasty Bhaumäsura."
