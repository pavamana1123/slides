Together with Queen Satyabhämä, the Lord mounted His carrier Garuòa and traveled to the capital of Narakäsura's kingdom. On a field outside the city He decapitated the demon Mura with His disc. Then He fought Mura's seven sons and sent them all to the abode of death, after which Narakäsura himself entered the battlefield on the back of an elephant. Naraka threw his çakti lance at Çré Kåñëa, but the weapon proved ineffective, and the Lord cut the demon's entire army to pieces. Finally, with His sharp-edged disc Kåñëa cut off Narakäsura's head."

She offered prayers to the Lord and presented Naraka's frightened son at Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet. After pacifying the demon's son, Kåñëa entered Narakäsura's palace, where He found sixteen thousand one hundred young women. As soon as they caught sight of the Lord, they all decided to accept Him as their husband. The Lord sent them to Dvärakä along with a great quantity of treasure and then went with Queen Satyabhämä to the abode of Indra. There He returned Aditi's earrings, and Indra and his wife, Çacé-devé, worshiped Him. On Satyabhämä's request, Lord Kåñëa uprooted the heavenly pärijäta tree and put it on the back of Garuòa. After defeating Indra and the other demigods who opposed His taking of the tree, Kåñëa returned with Queen Satyabhämä to Dvärakä, where He planted it in a garden adjacent to Satyabhämä's palace."

The demigods are prone to anger because they become intoxicated with pride in their opulences."
