Thus, within a lake in the Yamunä River the Lord showed them His personal abode. The cowherd men were amazed to see that the kingdom of God had exactly the same spiritual atmosphere as their own earthly Våndävana and that, just as in their Våndävana Lord Kåñëa was personally present, in their unique vision He was present as the Lord of the spiritual world."
