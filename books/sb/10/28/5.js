Indeed, the artha, the goal or real value of Varuëa's life, has now been achieved. Because Lord Kåñëa's form is transcendental, those who accept His lotus feet go beyond the boundary of material existence, and thus only the spiritually unaware would presume that the Lord's lotus feet are material."
