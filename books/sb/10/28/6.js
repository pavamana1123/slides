Thus neither the Lord nor recognized spiritual authorities would ever say that within the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, there is the fault of illusion. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé points out that the word brahmaëe here indicates the Lord is full in Himself, and that the term paramätmane indicates He is the controller of all living entities."
