Lord Kåñëa submerged the cowherd men in that lake in the sense that He submerged them in the awareness of the impersonal Brahman. But then, as indicated by the word uddhåtäù, He lifted them up to a higher understanding, that of the Personality of Godhead in His own planet. As clearly stated here, dadåçur brahmaëo lokam: They saw, just as Akrüra did, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Truth."

            "content": "The evolution of consciousness may be briefly summarized as follows: In ordinary consciousness we perceive and are attracted to the variety of material things. Rising to the first stage of spiritual consciousness, we transcend material variety and focus instead on the undifferentiated One, which lies behind and gives existence to the many. Finally, rising to Kåñëa consciousness, we find that the absolute, spiritual One contains its own eternal variety. In fact, since this world is a mere shadow of eternal existence, we would expect to find spiritual variety within the One, and indeed we do find it in the sacred text of Çrémad-Bhägavatam."

The reason Çukadeva Gosvämé says Akrüra saw Vaikuëöha purä, \"previously,\" is that all these incidents took place many years before the conversation between Çukadeva Gosvämé and Mahäräja Parékñit."
