First, the servant was foolishly ignorant of Nanda Mahäräja's position as the pastime father of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Also, Nanda Mahäräja's intention was to carry out the injunctions of scripture; therefore Varuëa's servant should not have arrested Nanda on the technical grounds that he bathed in the Yamunä at an inauspicious time. Later in this chapter Varuëa himself will say, ajänatä mämakena müòhena: \"This was done by my ignorant servant, who is a fool.\" This foolish servant did not understand the position of Kåñëa or Nanda Mahäräja or devotional service to the Lord."
