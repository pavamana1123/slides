The following explanation is given by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé in his commentary on the first verse of this chapter: After an especially short Ekädaçé, measuring only eighteen hours, about six hours of the lunar day in which the fast had to be broken, namely the Dvädaçé, had already expired before the dawn. Since at sunrise the proper time for breaking the fast would have passed, Nanda Mahäräja decided to enter the water at an otherwise inauspicious time."

            "content": "Of course, Varuëa's servant should have been aware of these technical details, which are meant for strict followers of the Vedic rituals. Above and beyond that, Nanda Mahäräja was acting as the Supreme Lord's father and was therefore a most sacred person, beyond the touch of insignificant cosmic bureaucrats like the foolish servant of Varuëa."
