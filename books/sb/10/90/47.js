    "translation": "The heavenly Ganges is a holy place of pilgrimage because her waters wash Lord Kåñëa's feet. But when the Lord descended among the Yadus, His glories eclipsed the Ganges as a holy place. Both those who hated Kåñëa and those who loved Him attained eternal forms like His in the spiritual world. The unattainable and supremely self-satisfied goddess of fortune, for the sake of whose favor everyone else struggles, belongs to Him alone. His name destroys all inauspiciousness when heard or chanted. He alone has set forth the principles of the various disciplic successions of sages. What wonder is it that He, whose personal weapon is the wheel of time, relieved the burden of the earth?",

Devotees like the cowherd girls of Vraja and others attained His personal association by entering into His eternal pleasure pastimes in the spiritual world, while inimical demons killed by Him attained the säyujya-mukti of merging into His divine form. When He was present on this earth, Lord Kåñëa's compassion extended to His family, friends and servants, and also to His enemies and their families, friends and servants. Great authorities like Lord Brahmä have mentioned this fact: sad-veñäd iva pütanäpi sa-kulä tväm eva deväpitä. \"My Lord, You have already given Yourself to Pütanä and her family members simply because she dressed herself as a devotee.\" Third, Goddess Lakñmé, Lord Näräyaëa's constant companion, whom great demigods serve menially to win her slight favor, was unable to win the privilege of joining the intimate company of Lord Kåñëa's devotees in Vraja. Despite her eagerness to participate in the räsa dance and other pastimes enacted by Çré Kåñëa, and despite the severe austerities she underwent to achieve that end, she could not transcend her natural mood of reverence. The sweetness and intimacy Lord Kåñëa manifested in Våndävana constitute a unique kind of opulence found nowhere else, even in Vaikuëöha. As Çré Uddhava says,"
