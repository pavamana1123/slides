    "translation": "To protect the principles of devotional service to Himself, Lord Kåñëa, the best of the Yadus, accepts the pastime forms that have been glorified here in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. One who desires to faithfully serve His lotus feet should hear of the activities He performs in each of these incarnations—activities that suitably imitate those of the forms He assumes. Hearing narrations of these pastimes destroys the reactions to fruitive work.",
