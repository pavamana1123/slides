The process of devotional service begins with hearing topics about the Supreme Lord. When one has heard these topics properly, he can then proceed to chant them for others' benefit and reflect on their significance. This leads to faithful adherence to the principles of devotional service, which culminates in absolute faith in Lord Kåñëa. Such perfect faith gives one the right to enter the Lord's intimate service and, in due course of time, return to one's eternal, spiritual life in one of the Lord's personal domains."
