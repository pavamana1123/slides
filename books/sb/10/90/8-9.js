    "translation": "As Gandharvas joyfully sang His praises to the accompaniment of mådaìga, paëava and änaka drums, and as professional reciters known as Sütas, Mägadhas and Vandés played véëäs and recited poems praising Him, Lord Kåñëa would play with His wives in the water. Laughing, the queens would squirt water on Him with syringes, and He would squirt them back. Thus Kåñëa would sport with His queens in the same way that the lord of the Yakñas sports with the Yakñé nymphs.",
