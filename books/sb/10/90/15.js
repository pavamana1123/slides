            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains that the transcendental madness (unmäda) of the queens filled them with such ecstasy that they saw their own mood reflected in everyone and everything else. Here they point out to the kuraré bird, whom they take to be sorrowing over separation from Lord Kåñëa, that if the Lord actually had any concern for her or themselves, He would not be sleeping comfortably at that moment. They warn the kuraré not to expect Kåñëa to hear her lamentation and show some mercy. In case the kuraré might think that Kåñëa is sleeping with His queens, they deny this by saying that He is gupta-bodha: His whereabouts are unknown to them. He is out in the world somewhere this night, but they have no idea where to go looking for Him. \"Ah, dear bird,\" they cry, \"even though you are a simple creature, your heart has been deeply pierced, just like ours. You must have had some contact, then, with our Kåñëa. What keeps you from giving up your hopeless attachment to Him?\""
