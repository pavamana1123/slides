By this insight the äcärya helps refute the false notion that after Lord Kåñëa's departure from this world, some primitive cowherds kidnapped His queens while they were under the protection of Arjuna. In fact, as the self-realized Vaiñëava commentators elsewhere explain, Lord Kåñëa Himself appeared in the guise of the thieves who abducted the queens. For further information on this subject, see Çréla Prabhupäda's purport to Çrémad-Bhägavatam ."

            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté remarks that the supreme goal attained by these exalted women was not the liberation of the impersonal yogés but the perfect state of prema-bhakti, pure loving devotion. Indeed, since they were already imbued with divine love of God from the very beginning, they possessed transcendental bodies of eternity, knowledge and bliss, in which they were fully able to relish the pleasure of reciprocating with the Supreme Lord in his most intimate, sweet pastimes. Specifically, in the opinion of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, their love of God matured into the ecstasy of madness in pure love (bhävonmada), just as the gopés' love did when Kåñëa disappeared from their midst during the räsa dance. At that time the gopés experienced the full development of ecstatic madness, which they expressed in their inquiries from the various creatures of the forest and in such words as kåñëo 'haà paçyata gatim: \"I am Kåñëa! Just see how gracefully I move!\"  Similarly, the viläsa, or flourishing transformation, of the ecstatic love of Lord Dvärakädhéça's principal queens has produced the prema-vaicitrya symptoms they have exhibited here."
