    "translation": "Lord Çré Kåñëa is He who is known as jana-niväsa, the ultimate resort of all living entities, and who is also known as Devakénandana or Yaçodä-nandana, the son of Devaké and Yaçodä. He is the guide of the Yadu dynasty, and with His mighty arms He kills everything inauspicious, as well as every man who is impious. By His presence He destroys all things inauspicious for all living entities, moving and inert. His blissful smiling face always increases the lusty desires of the gopés of Våndävana. May He be all glorious and happy!",

According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé has composed this beautiful verse to console those who lament the fact that Lord Kåñëa did not continue to manifest His intimate pastimes down to the present time. Here Çré Çukadeva reminds his listeners that the Lord is eternally present in this world—in His holy abode, His name and the recitation of His glories. This idea is expressed by the word jayati (\"He is victorious\"), which is in the present tense rather than the past."

            "content": "Çréla Prabhupäda explains this verse as follows in Kåñëa: \"Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé thus concludes his description of the superexalted position of Lord Kåñëa by glorifying Him in the following way: 'O Lord Kåñëa, all glories unto You. You are present in everyone's heart as Paramätmä. Therefore You are known as Jananiväsa, one who lives in everyone's heart.' As confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä, éçvaraù sarva-bhütänäà håd-deçe 'rjuna tiñöhati:  The Supreme Lord in His Paramätmä feature lives in everyone's heart. This does not mean, however, that Kåñëa has no separate existence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Mäyävädé philosophers accept the all-pervading feature of Parabrahman, but when Parabrahman, or the Supreme Lord, appears, they think that He appears under the control of material nature. Because Lord Kåñëa appeared as the son of Devaké, the Mäyävädé philosophers accept Kåñëa to be an ordinary living entity who takes birth within this material world. Therefore Çukadeva Gosvämé warns them: devaké-janma-vädaù, which means that although Kåñëa is famous as the son of Devaké, actually He is the Supersoul, or the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Although Kåñëa first of all appeared as the son of Devaké, He immediately transferred Himself to the lap of mother Yaçodä, and His childhood pastimes were blissfully enjoyed by mother Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja. This fact was also admitted by Vasudeva himself when he met Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä at Kurukñetra. He admitted that Kåñëa and Balaräma were actually the sons of mother Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja. Vasudeva and Devaké were only Their official father and mother...."

            "content": "\"Çukadeva Gosvämé then glorifies the Lord as one who is honored by the yadu-vara-pariñat, the assembly house of the Yadu dynasty, and as the killer of different kinds of demons. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could have killed all the demons by employing His different material energies, but He wanted to kill them personally in order to give them salvation. There was no need of Kåñëa's coming to this material world to kill the demons. Simply by His willing, many hundreds and thousands of demons could have been killed without His personal endeavor. But actually He descended for His pure devotees, to play as a child with mother Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja and to give pleasure to the inhabitants of Dvärakä. By killing the demons and by giving protection to the devotees, Lord Kåñëa established the real religious principle, which is simply love of God. By following the factual religious principles of love of God, even the living entities known as sthira-cara were also delivered from all material contamination and were transferred to the spiritual kingdom. Sthira means the trees and plants, which cannot move, and cara means the moving animals, specifically the cows. When Kåñëa was present, He delivered all the trees, monkeys and other plants and animals who happened to see Him and serve Him both in Våndävana and Dvärakä."

Çukadeva Gosvämé glorifies Lord Kåñëa for His enchanting smile, by which He enchanted not only the gopés of Våndävana but also the queens at Dvärakä. The exact words used in this connection are vardhayan kämadevam. In Våndävana as the boyfriend of many gopés and in Dvärakä as the husband of many queens, Kåñëa increased their lusty desires to enjoy with Him. For God realization or self-realization, one generally has to undergo severe austerities and penances for many, many thousands of years, and then it may be possible to realize God. But the gopés and the queens of Dvärakä, simply by enhancing their lusty desires to enjoy Kåñëa as their boyfriend or husband, received the highest type of salvation.\""
