Devaké requested the Lord, who had appeared as Viñëu, to conceal that form, for she wanted to see the Lord as an ordinary child, like a child appreciated by persons who have material eyes. Devaké wanted to see whether the Supreme Personality of Godhead had factually appeared or she was dreaming the Viñëu form. If Kaàsa were to come, she thought, upon seeing the Viñëu form he would immediately kill the child, but if he saw a human child, he might reconsider. Devaké was afraid of Ugrasena-ätmaja; that is, she was afraid not of Ugrasena and his men, but of the son of Ugrasena. Thus she requested the Lord to dissipate that fear, since He is always ready to give protection (abhayam) to His devotees. \"My Lord,\" she prayed, \"I request You to save me from the cruel hands of the son of Ugrasena, Kaàsa. I am praying to Your Lordship to please rescue me from this fearful condition because You are always ready to give protection to Your servitors.\" The Lord has confirmed this statement in the Bhagavad-gétä by assuring Arjuna, \"You may declare to the world, My devotee shall never be vanquished.\""

So I request that for the time being You become invisible to our material eyes.\" In other words, she requested the Lord to assume the form of an ordinary child. \"My only cause of fear from my brother Kaàsa is due to Your appearance. My Lord Madhusüdana, Kaàsa may know that You are already born. Therefore I request You to conceal this four-armed form of Your Lordship, which holds the four symbols of Viñëu-namely the conchshell, the disc, the club and the lotus flower. My dear Lord, at the end of the annihilation of the cosmic manifestation, You put the whole universe within Your abdomen; still, by Your unalloyed mercy, You have appeared in my womb. I am surprised that You imitate the activities of ordinary human beings just to please Your devotee.\""

Out of motherly affection, therefore, she requested the Supreme Personality of Godhead to disappear. Although because of the Lord's disappearance Kaàsa would harass her more and more, thinking that the child born of her was hidden somewhere, she did not want the transcendental child to be harassed and killed. Therefore she requested Lord Viñëu to disappear. Later, when harassed, she would think of Him within her mind."
