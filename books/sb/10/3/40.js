            "content": "According to the Sanskrit dictionary Amara-koça, sex life is also called grämya-dharma, material desire, but in spiritual life this grämya-dharma, the material desire for sex, is not very much appreciated. If one has a tinge of attachment for the material enjoyments of eating, sleeping, mating and defending, one is not niñkiïcana. But one really should be niñkiïcana. Therefore, one should be free from the desire to beget a child like Kåñëa by sexual enjoyment. This is indirectly hinted at in this verse."
