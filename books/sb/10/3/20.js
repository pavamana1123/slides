Çuklam, or 'whiteness,' is the symbolic representation of the Absolute Truth because it is unaffected by the material qualities. Lord Brahmä is called rakta, or red, because Brahmä represents the qualities of passion for creation. Darkness is entrusted to Lord Çiva because he annihilates the cosmos. The creation, annihilation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation are conducted by Your potencies, yet You are always unaffected by those qualities.\" As confirmed in the Vedas, harir hi nirguëaù säkñät: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always free from all material qualities. It is also said that the qualities of passion and ignorance are nonexistent in the person of the Supreme Lord."

            "content": "In this verse, the three colors mentioned-çukla, rakta and kåñëa—are not to be understood literally, in terms of what we experience with our senses, but rather as representatives of sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa. After all, sometimes we see that a duck is white, although it is in tamo-guëa, the mode of ignorance. Illustrating the logic called bakändha-nyäya, the duck is such a fool that it runs after the testicles of a bull, thinking them to be a hanging fish that can be taken when it drops. Thus the duck is always in darkness. Vyäsadeva, however, the compiler of the Vedic literature, is blackish, but this does not mean that he is in tamo-guëa; rather, he is in the highest position of sattva-guëa, beyond the material modes of nature. Sometimes these colors (çukla-raktas tathä pétaù) are used to designate the brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras. Lord Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu is celebrated as possessing a blackish color, Lord Çiva is whitish, and Lord Brahmä is reddish, but according to Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé in the Vaiñëava-toñaëé-öékä, this exhibition of colors is not what is referred to here."

In summary, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always beyond the material qualities, and we should not be misled into thinking otherwise simply because of sense perception. One must understand the position of the Lord through the authorities, or mahäjanas. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam , ete cäàça-kaläù puàsaù kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam."
