    "translation": "Vasudeva then saw the newborn child, who had very wonderful lotuslike eyes and who bore in His four hands the four weapons çaìkha, cakra, gadä and padma. On His chest was the mark of Çrévatsa and on His neck the brilliant Kaustubha gem. Dressed in yellow, His body blackish like a dense cloud, His scattered hair fully grown, and His helmet and earrings sparkling uncommonly with the valuable gem Vaidürya, the child, decorated with a brilliant belt, armlets, bangles and other ornaments, appeared very wonderful.",

            "content": "To support the word adbhutam, meaning \"wonderful,\" the decorations and opulences of the newborn child are fully described. As confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38), barhävataàsam asitämbuda-sundaräìgam: the hue of the Lord's beautiful form resembles the blackish color of dense clouds (asita means \"blackish,\" and ambuda means \"cloud\"). It is clear from the word catur-bhujam that Kåñëa first appeared with four hands, as Lord Viñëu. No ordinary child in human society has ever been born with four hands. And when is a child born with fully grown hair? The descent of the Lord, therefore, is completely distinct from the birth of an ordinary child. The Vaidürya gem, which sometimes appears bluish, sometimes yellow and sometimes red, is available in Vaikuëöhaloka. The Lord's helmet and earrings were decorated with this particular gem."
