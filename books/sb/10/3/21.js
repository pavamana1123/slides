    "translation": "O my Lord, proprietor of all creation, You have now appeared in my house, desiring to protect this world. I am sure that You will kill all the armies that are moving all over the world under the leadership of politicians who are dressed as kñatriya rulers but who are factually demons. They must be killed by You for the protection of the innocent public.",

            "content": "Kåñëa appears in this world for two purposes, pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm:  to protect the innocent, religious devotees of the Lord and to annihilate all the uneducated, uncultured asuras, who unnecessarily bark like dogs and fight among themselves for political power. It is said, kali-käle näma-rüpe kåñëa avatära. The Hare Kåñëa movement is also an incarnation of Kåñëa in the form of the holy name (näma-rüpe). Every one of us who is actually afraid of the asuric rulers and politicians must welcome this incarnation of Kåñëa: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Then we will surely be protected from the harassment of asuric rulers. At the present moment these rulers are so powerful that by hook or by crook they capture the highest posts in government and harass countless numbers of people on the plea of national security or some emergency. Then again, one asura defeats another asura, but the public continues to suffer. Therefore the entire world is in a precarious condition, and the only hope is this Hare Kåñëa movement. Lord Nåsiàhadeva appeared when Prahläda was excessively harassed by his asuric father. Because of such asuric fathers—that is, the ruling politicians—it is very difficult to press forward the Hare Kåñëa movement, but because Kåñëa has now appeared in His holy name through this movement, we can hope that these asuric fathers will be annihilated and the kingdom of God established all over the world. The entire world is now full of many asuras in the guise of politicians, gurus, sädhus, yogés and incarnations, and they are misleading the general public away from Kåñëa consciousness, which can offer true benefit to human society."
