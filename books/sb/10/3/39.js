This attachment came about by the influence of devamäyä. Loving Kåñëa as one's son is a Vedic principle. Vasudeva and Devaké never desired anything but to have the Lord as their son, yet for this purpose they apparently wanted to live like ordinary gåhasthas for sexual indulgence. Although this was a transaction of spiritual potency, their desire appears like attachment for sex in conjugal life. If one wants to return home, back to Godhead, one must give up such desires. This is possible only when one develops intense love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has said:"
