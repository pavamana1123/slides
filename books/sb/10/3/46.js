The Lord is not a präkåta-çiçu, a child of this world, but by His personal energy He appeared like one. Ordinary people may have difficulty accepting the supreme controller, God, as a human being because they forget that He can do everything by spiritual energy (ätma-mäyayä). Nonbelievers say, \"How can the supreme controller descend as an ordinary being?\" This sort of thinking is materialistic. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé says that unless we accept the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as inconceivable, beyond the conception of our words and mind, we cannot understand the Supreme Lord. Those who doubt that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can come as a human being and turn Himself into a human child are fools who think that Kåñëa's body is material, that He is born and that He therefore also dies."

Mahäräja Parékñit inquired from Çukadeva Gosvämé, \"When all the members of the Yadu dynasty met their end, Kåñëa also put an end to Himself, and the only member of the family who remained alive was Uddhava. How was this possible?\" Çukadeva Gosvämé answered that Kåñëa, by His own energy, destroyed the entire family and then thought of making His own body disappear. In this connection, Çukadeva Gosvämé described how the Lord gave up His body. But this was not the destruction of Kåñëa's body; rather, it was the disappearance of the Supreme Lord by His personal energy."

This does not mean that He gives up His body. By spiritual energy, the Lord can appear in a body made of wood or stone. He can change His body into anything because everything is His energy (paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate . By following the instructions of sädhu, guru and çästra—the saintly persons, the spiritual master and the authoritative scriptures—one can understand Kåñëa, and then one makes his life successful by returning home, back to Godhead."
