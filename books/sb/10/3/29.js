She was aware that the Lord had killed many demons like Madhu who were hundreds and thousands of times more powerful than Kaàsa, yet because of affection for the transcendental child, she believed that Kaàsa could kill Him. Instead of thinking of the unlimited power of the Lord, she thought of the Lord with affection, and therefore she requested the transcendental child to disappear."
