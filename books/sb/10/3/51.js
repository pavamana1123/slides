    "translation": "When Vasudeva reached the house of Nanda Mahäräja, he saw that all the cowherd men were fast asleep. Thus he placed his own son on the bed of Yaçodä, picked up her daughter, an expansion of Yogamäyä, and then returned to his residence, the prison house of Kaàsa.",

            "content": "Vasudeva knew very well that as soon as the daughter was in the prison house of Kaàsa, Kaàsa would immediately kill her; but to protect his own child, he had to kill the child of his friend. Nanda Mahäräja was his friend, but out of deep affection and attachment for his own son, he knowingly did this. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says that one cannot be blamed for protecting one's own child at the sacrifice of another's. Furthermore, Vasudeva cannot be accused of callousness, since his actions were impelled by the force of Yogamäyä."
