As the son of Devaké, He first appeared as Viñëu, and because Vasudeva was not in the position of pure affection for Kåñëa, Vasudeva worshiped his son as Lord Viñëu. Yaçodä, however, pleased her son Kåñëa without understanding His Godhood. This is the difference between Kåñëa as the son of Yaçodä and as the son of Devaké. This is explained by Viçvanätha Cakravarté on the authority of Hari-vaàça."
