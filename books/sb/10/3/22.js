    "translation": "O my Lord, Lord of the demigods, after hearing the prophecy that You would take birth in our home and kill him, this uncivilized Kaàsa killed so many of Your elder brothers. As soon as he hears from his lieutenants that You have appeared, he will immediately come with weapons to kill You.",

            "content": "Kaàsa has here been described as asabhya, meaning \"uncivilized\" or \"most heinous,\" because he killed the many children of his sister. When he heard the prophecy that he would be killed by her eighth son, this uncivilized man, Kaàsa, was immediately ready to kill his innocent sister on the occasion of her marriage. An uncivilized man can do anything for the satisfaction of his senses. He can kill children, he can kill cows, he can kill brähmaëas, he can kill old men; he has no mercy for anyone. According to the Vedic civilization, cows, women, children, old men and brähmaëas should be excused if they are at fault. But asuras, uncivilized men, do not care about that. At the present moment, the killing of cows and the killing of children is going on unrestrictedly, and therefore this civilization is not at all human, and those who are conducting this condemned civilization are uncivilized asuras."

            "content": "Such uncivilized men are not in favor of the Kåñëa consciousness movement. As public officers, they declare without hesitation that the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa movement is a nuisance, although Bhagavad-gétä clearly says, satataà kértayanto mäà yatantaç ca dåòha-vratäù . According to this verse, it is the duty of the mahätmäs to chant the Hare Kåñëa mantra and try to spread it all over the world to the best of their ability. Unfortunately, society is in such an uncivilized state that there are so-called mahätmäs who are prepared to kill cows and children and stop the Hare Kåñëa movement. Such uncivilized activities were actually demonstrated in opposition to the Hare Kåñëa movement's Bombay center, Hare Kåñëa Land. As Kaàsa was not expected to kill the beautiful child of Devaké and Vasudeva, the uncivilized society, although unhappy about the advancement of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, cannot be expected to stop it. Yet we must face many difficulties in many different ways. Although Kåñëa cannot be killed, Vasudeva, as the father of Kåñëa, was trembling because in affection he thought that Kaàsa would immediately come and kill his son. Similarly, although the Kåñëa consciousness movement and Kåñëa are not different and no asuras can check it, we are afraid that at any moment the asuras can stop this movement in any part of the world."
