Kåñëa's father, His mother, His friends the cowherd boys, and the cows are all expansions of Kåñëa, as will be explained in the brahma-vimohana-lélä. When Brahmä took away Kåñëa's associates to test the supremacy of Lord Kåñëa, the Lord expanded Himself again in the forms of the many cowherd boys and calves, all of whom, as Brahmä saw, were viñëu-mürtis. Devaké is also an expansion of Kåñëa, and therefore this verse says, devakyäà deva-rüpiëyäà viñëuù sarva-guhä-çayaù."

The appearance of Lord Viñëu at that time could be compared to the rising of the full moon in the sky on the eastern horizon. The objection may be raised that since Lord Kåñëa appeared on the eighth day of the waning moon, there could be no rising of the full moon. In answer to this it may be said that Lord Kåñëa appeared in the dynasty which is in the hierarchy of the moon; therefore, although the moon was incomplete on that night, because of the Lord's appearance in the dynasty wherein the moon is himself the original person, the moon was in an overjoyous condition, so by the grace of Kåñëa he could appear as a full moon. To welcome the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the waning moon became a full moon in jubilation."

The Lord is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1), and Devaké is also sac-cid-änanda-vigraha. Therefore no one can find any fault in the way the Supreme Personality of Godhead, sac-cid-änanda-vigraha, appeared from the womb of Devaké."

Actually, however, the Lord's birth is never ordinary. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is already situated within the core of everyone's heart as antaryämé, the Supersoul. Thus because He was present in full potency in Devaké's heart, He was also able to appear outside her body."

This verse describes the inconceivable potency of the Lord, who appeared like the full moon.
