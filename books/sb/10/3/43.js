            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead chooses a mother and father from whom to take birth again and again. The Lord took birth originally from Sutapä and Påçni, then from Kaçyapa and Aditi, and again from the same father and mother, Vasudeva and Devaké. \"In other appearances also,\" the Lord said, \"I took the form of an ordinary child just to become your son so that we could reciprocate eternal love.\" Jéva Gosvämé has explained this verse in his Kåñëa-sandarbha, Ninety-sixth Chapter, where he notes that in text 37 the Lord says, amunä vapuña, meaning \"by this same form.\" In other words, the Lord told Devaké, \"This time I have appeared in My original form as Çré Kåñëa.\" Çréla Jéva Gosvämé says that the other forms were partial expansions of the Lord's original form, but because of the intense love developed by Påçni and Sutapä, the Lord appeared from Devaké and Vasudeva in His full opulence as Çré Kåñëa. In this verse the Lord confirms, \"I am the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, but I appear in full opulence as Çré Kåñëa.\" This is the purport of the words tenaiva vapuñä. When the Lord mentioned the birth of Påçnigarbha, He did not say tenaiva vapuñä, but He assured Devaké that in the third birth the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa had appeared, not His partial expansion. Påçnigarbha and Vämana were partial expansions of Kåñëa, but in this third birth Kåñëa Himself appeared. This is the explanation given in Çré Kåñëa-sandarbha by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé."
