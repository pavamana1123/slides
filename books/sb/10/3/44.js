Nonetheless, she was anxious, thinking that if her neighbors heard that Viñëu had appeared as her son, none of them would believe it. Therefore she wanted Lord Viñëu to transform Himself into a human child. On the other hand, the Supreme Lord was also anxious, thinking that if He appeared as an ordinary child, she would not believe that Lord Viñëu had appeared. Such are the dealings between devotees and the Lord. The Lord deals with His devotees exactly like a human being, but this does not mean that the Lord is one of the human beings, for this is the conclusion of nondevotees (avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà tanum äçritam  \"Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances and worship Me.\" A nondevotee cannot believe that simply by thinking of one person, one can achieve liberation from this material world and go back home, back to Godhead. But this is a fact. The Lord comes as a human being, and if one becomes attached to the Lord on the platform of loving service, one's promotion to the transcendental world is assured."
