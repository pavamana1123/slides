    "translation": "Thereafter, at the auspicious time for the appearance of the Lord, the entire universe was surcharged with all the qualities of goodness, beauty and peace. The constellation Rohiëé appeared, as did stars like Açviné. The sun, the moon and the other stars and planets were very peaceful. All directions appeared extremely pleasing, and the beautiful stars twinkled in the cloudless sky. Decorated with towns, villages, mines and pasturing grounds, the earth seemed all-auspicious. The rivers flowed with clear water, and the lakes and vast reservoirs, full of lilies and lotuses, were extraordinarily beautiful. In the trees and green plants, full of flowers and leaves, pleasing to the eyes, birds like cuckoos and swarms of bees began chanting with sweet voices for the sake of the demigods. A pure breeze began to blow, pleasing the sense of touch and bearing the aroma of flowers, and when the brähmaëas engaging in ritualistic ceremonies ignited their fires according to Vedic principles, the fires burned steadily, undisturbed by the breeze. Thus when the birthless Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was about to appear, the saints and brähmaëas, who had always been disturbed by demons like Kaàsa and his men, felt peace within the core of their hearts, and kettledrums simultaneously vibrated from the upper planetary system.",

The Lord's appearance or birth is not like that of an ordinary man, who is forced to accept a material body according to his past deeds. The Lord's appearance is explained in the previous chapter: He appears out of His own sweet pleasure."

The astrological influence of the constellation known as Rohiëé was also predominant because this constellation is considered very auspicious. Rohiëé is under the direct supervision of Brahmä, who is born of Viñëu, and it appears at the birth of Lord Viñëu, who in fact is birthless. According to the astrological conclusion, besides the proper situation of the stars, there are auspicious and inauspicious moments due to the different situations of the different planetary systems. At the time of Kåñëa's birth, the planetary systems were automatically adjusted so that everything became auspicious."

Auspicious stars were visible in the sky, and on the surface in all towns and villages or pasturing grounds and within the mind of everyone there were signs of good fortune. The rivers were flowing full of water, and the lakes were beautifully decorated with lotus flowers. The forests were full with beautiful birds and peacocks. All the birds within the forests began to sing with sweet voices, and the peacocks began to dance with their consorts. The wind blew very pleasantly, carrying the aroma of different flowers, and the sensation of bodily touch was very pleasing. At home, the brähmaëas, who were accustomed to offer sacrifices in the fire, found their homes very pleasant for offerings. Because of disturbances created by the demoniac kings, the sacrificial fire had been almost stopped in the houses of brähmaëas, but now they could find the opportunity to start the fire peacefully. Being forbidden to offer sacrifices, the brähmaëas were very distressed in mind, intelligence and activities. But just on the point of Kåñëa's appearance, automatically their minds became full of joy because they could hear loud vibrations in the sky of transcendental sounds proclaiming the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Kåñëa was born during the month of September, yet it appeared like springtime. The atmosphere, however, was very cool, although not chilly, and the rivers and reservoirs appeared just as they would in çarat, the fall. Lotuses and lilies blossom during the day, but although Kåñëa appeared at twelve o'clock midnight, the lilies and lotuses were in bloom, and thus the wind blowing at that time was full of fragrance. Because of Kaàsa's disturbances, the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies had almost stopped. The brähmaëas and saintly persons could not execute the Vedic rituals with peaceful minds. But now the brähmaëas were very pleased to perform their daily ritualistic ceremonies undisturbed. The business of the asuras is to disturb the suras, the devotees and brähmaëas, but at the time of Kåñëa's appearance these devotees and brähmaëas were undisturbed."
