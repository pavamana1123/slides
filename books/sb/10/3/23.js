            "content": "The word suvismitä, meaning \"astonished,\" is significant in this verse. Devaké and her husband, Vasudeva, were assured that their child was the Supreme Personality of Godhead and could not be killed by Kaàsa, but because of affection, as they thought of Kaàsa's previous atrocities, they were simultaneously afraid that Kåñëa would be killed. This is why the word suvismitä has been used. Similarly, we are also astounded upon thinking of whether this movement will be killed by the asuras or will continue to advance without fear."
