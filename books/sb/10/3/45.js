One should never think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as an ordinary human being, as nondevotees do. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, personally appeared and left His instructions for the benefit of all human society, but fools and rascals unfortunately think of Him as an ordinary human being and twist the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä for the satisfaction of their senses. Practically everyone commenting on Bhagavad-gétä interprets it for sense gratification. It has become especially fashionable for modern scholars and politicians to interpret Bhagavad-gétä as if it were something fictitious, and by their wrong interpretations they are spoiling their own careers and the careers of others. The Kåñëa consciousness movement, however, is fighting against this principle of regarding Kåñëa as a fictitious person and of accepting that there was no Battle of Kurukñetra, that everything is symbolic, and that nothing in Bhagavad-gétä is true. In any case, if one truly wants to be successful, one can do so by reading the text of Bhagavad-gétä as it is. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu especially stressed the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä: yäre dekha, täre kaha 'kåñëa'-upadeça . If one wants to achieve the highest success in life, one must accept Bhagavad-gétä as spoken by the Supreme Lord. By accepting Bhagavad-gétä in this way, all of human society can become perfect and happy."

That would keep them in touch with Him. After eleven years, the Lord would return to Mathurä to be their son, and therefore there was no question of separation."
