Kåñëa is eternal, and His selection of a father and mother from among His devotees takes place eternally. Previously also, Devaké had been the Lord's mother and Vasudeva the Lord's father, and they were named Påçni and Sutapä. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He accepts His eternal father and mother, and they accept Kåñëa as their son. This pastime takes place eternally and is therefore called nitya-lélä. Thus there was no cause for surprise or ridicule. As confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä :"
