    "translation": "My dear father and mother, you endured rain, wind, strong sun, scorching heat and severe cold, suffering all sorts of inconvenience according to different seasons. By practicing präëäyäma to control the air within the body through yoga, and by eating only air and dry leaves fallen from the trees, you cleansed from your minds all dirty things. In this way, desiring a benediction from Me, you worshiped Me with peaceful minds.",

Here we can see how Vasudeva and Devaké obtained Kåñëa as their eternal son. In our own lives, we are meant to follow the principles indicated herewith for getting good children. Of course, it is not possible for everyone to get Kåñëa as his son, but at least one can get very good sons and daughters for the benefit of human society. In Bhagavad-gétä it is said that if human beings do not follow the spiritual way of life, there will be an increase of varëa-saìkara population, population begotten like cats and dogs, and the entire world will become like hell. Not practicing Kåñëa consciousness but simply encouraging artificial means to check the population will be futile; the population will increase, and it will consist of varëa-saìkara, unwanted progeny. It is better to teach people how to beget children not like hogs and dogs, but in controlled life."

The Kåñëa consciousness movement, therefore, is teaching people not to adopt artificial means of happiness, but to take the real path of happiness as prescribed in the çästra—the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra—and become perfect in every aspect of material existence."
