Since I am the best of all bestowers of benediction, I appeared in this same form as Kåñëa to ask you to take from Me the benediction you desired. You then expressed your desire to have a son exactly like Me.",

Sutapä was the son of Brahmä, and as we have already understood from Bhagavad-gétä ), we need only understand Him and love Him. Through love only, we can very easily go back home, back to Godhead. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu therefore declared, premä pum-artho mahän: love of Godhead is the highest achievement for anyone."

Sutapä and his wife, Påçni, inaugurated their devotional activities on the basis of full knowledge. Gradually they developed love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and when this love was mature, the Lord appeared as Viñëu, although Devaké then requested Him to assume the form of Kåñëa. To love the Supreme Personality of Godhead more, we want a form of the Lord like Kåñëa or Räma. We can engage in loving transactions with Kåñëa especially."

We should therefore take advantage of the benediction given by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, and when by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra we are cleansed of all dirty things (ceto-darpaëa-märjanam )."

Then one can very easily go back home, back to Godhead. Instead of bringing the Lord here for some material purpose, to have a son or whatever else, if we go back home, back to Godhead, our real relationship with the Lord is revealed, and we eternally engage in our eternal relationship. By chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra, we gradually develop our eternal relationship with the Supreme Person and thus attain the perfection called svarüpa-siddhi. We should take advantage of this benediction and go back home, back to Godhead. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura has therefore sung, patita-pävana-hetu tava avatära: Caitanya Mahäprabhu appeared as an incarnation to deliver all fallen souls like us and directly bestow upon us love of Godhead. We must take advantage of this great benediction of the great Personality of Godhead."
