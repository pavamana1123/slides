Because they were afraid of Kaàsa, when the Lord appeared as an ordinary child they took Him to Gokula, the home of Nanda Mahäräja."

Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared with four hands, as if born from her womb. Upon seeing the Lord in that Viñëu form, Vasudeva was struck with wonder, and in transcendental happiness he and Devaké mentally gave ten thousand cows in charity to the brähmaëas. Vasudeva then offered prayers to the Lord, addressing Him as the Supreme Person, Parabrahman, the Supersoul, who is beyond duality and who is internally and externally all-pervading. The Lord, the cause of all causes, is beyond material existence, although He is the creator of this material world. When He enters this world as Paramätmä, He is all-pervading (aëòäntara-stha-paramäëu-cayäntara-stham (BS 5.35)), yet He is transcendentally situated. For the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material world, the Lord appears as the guëa-avatäras-Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara. Thus Vasudeva offered prayers full of meaning to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Devaké followed her husband by offering prayers describing the transcendental nature of the Lord. Fearing Kaàsa and desiring that the Lord not be understood by atheistic and materialistic nondevotees, she prayed that the Lord withdraw His transcendental four-armed form and appear like an ordinary child with two hands."

            "content": "The Lord reminded Vasudeva and Devaké of two other incarnations in which He had appeared as their son. He had appeared as Påçnigarbha and Vämanadeva, and now this was the third time He was appearing as the son of Devaké to fulfill their desire. The Lord then decided to leave the residence of Vasudeva and Devaké, in the prison house of Kaàsa, and at this very time, Yogamäyä took birth as the daughter of Yaçodä. By the arrangement of Yogamäyä, Vasudeva was able to leave the prison house and save the child from the hands of Kaàsa. When Vasudeva brought Kåñëa to the house of Nanda Mahäräja, he saw that by Yogamäyä's arrangement, Yaçodä, as well as everyone else, was deeply asleep. Thus he exchanged the babies, taking Yogamäyä from Yaçodä's lap and placing Kåñëa there instead. Then Vasudeva returned to his own place, having taken Yogamäyä as his daughter. He placed Yogamäyä on Devaké's bed and prepared to be a prisoner as before. In Gokula, Yaçodä could not understand whether she had given birth to a male or a female child."
