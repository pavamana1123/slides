            "content": "Nanda Mahäräja and Vasudeva were intimate friends, and so were their wives, Yaçodä and Devaké. Although their names were different, they were practically nondifferent personalities. The only difference is that Devaké was able to understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had been born to her and had now changed into Kåñëa, whereas Yaçodä was not able to understand what kind of child had been born to her. Yaçodä was such an advanced devotee that she never regarded Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but simply loved Him as her own child. Devaké, however, knew from the very beginning that although Kåñëa was her son, He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Våndävana, no one regarded Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When something very wonderful happened because of Kåñëa's activities, the inhabitants of Våndävana—the cowherd men, the cowherd boys, Nanda Mahäräja, Yaçodä and the others—were surprised, but they never considered their son Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes they suggested that some great demigod had appeared there as Kåñëa. In such an exalted status of devotional service, a devotee forgets the position of Kåñëa and intensely loves the Supreme Personality of Godhead without understanding His position. This is called kevala-bhakti and is distinct from the stages of jïäna and jïänamayé bhakti."
