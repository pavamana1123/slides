When Kåñëa appears, everyone is freed from fear of death, yet Devaké felt, \"We are still afraid of Kaàsa, although You have appeared as our son.\" She was more or less bewildered as to why this should be so, and she appealed to the Lord to free her and Vasudeva from this fear."

From the Vedic literature we understand that one who goes to the moon receives a life with a duration of ten thousand years in which to enjoy the fruits of pious activities. If our so-called scientists are going to the moon, why should they come back here? We must conclude without a doubt that they have never gone to the moon. To go to the moon, one must have the qualification of pious activities. Then one may go there and live. If one has gone to the moon, why should he return to this planet, where life is of a very short duration?"
