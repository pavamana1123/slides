    "translation": "Çré Devaké said: My dear Lord, there are different Vedas, some of which describe You as unperceivable through words and the mind. Yet You are the origin of the entire cosmic manifestation. You are Brahman, the greatest of everything, full of effulgence like the sun. You have no material cause, You are free from change and deviation, and You have no material desires. Thus the Vedas say that You are the substance. Therefore, my Lord, You are directly the origin of all Vedic statements, and by understanding You, one gradually understands everything. You are different from the light of Brahman and Paramätmä, yet You are not different from them. Everything emanates from You. Indeed, You are the cause of all causes, Lord Viñëu, the light of all transcendental knowledge.",

From the Åg Veda we understand, oà tad viñëoù paramaà padam: the original substance is the all-pervading Lord Viñëu, who is also Paramätmä and the effulgent Brahman. The living entities are also part and parcel of Viñëu, who has various energies (paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate sväbhäviké jïäna-bala-kriyä ca ). Viñëu, or Kåñëa, is therefore everything. Lord Kåñëa says in the Bhagavad-gétä , ahaà sarvasya prabhavo mattaù sarvaà pravartate: \"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.\" Kåñëa, therefore, is the original cause of everything (sarva-käraëa-käraëam (BS 5.1). When Viñëu expands in His all-pervading aspect, we should understand Him to be the niräkära-nirviçeña-brahmajyoti."

Therefore, after the prayers of Vasudeva, Devaké offered her prayers. She was very frightened because of her brother's atrocities. Devaké said, \"My dear Lord, Your eternal forms, like Näräyaëa, Lord Räma, Çeña, Varäha, Nåsiàha, Vämana, Baladeva, and millions of similar incarnations emanating from Viñëu, are described in the Vedic literature as original. You are original because all Your forms as incarnations are outside of this material creation. Your form was existing before this cosmic manifestation was created. Your forms are eternal and all-pervading. They are self-effulgent, changeless and uncontaminated by the material qualities. Such eternal forms are ever-cognizant and full of bliss; they are situated in transcendental goodness and are always engaged in different pastimes. You are not limited to a particular form only; all such transcendental, eternal forms are self-sufficient. I can understand that You are the Supreme Lord Viñëu.\" We may conclude, therefore, that Lord Viñëu is everything, although He is also different from everything. This is the acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva philosophy."
