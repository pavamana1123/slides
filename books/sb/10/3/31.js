This is the form available to the inhabitants of Våndävana, who are all in love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Çyämasundara, not as Lord Viñëu, Näräyaëa, who is worshiped in Vaikuëöha, where the devotees admire His opulence. Although Devaké is not on the Våndävana platform, she is near the Våndävana platform. On the Våndävana platform the mother of Kåñëa is mother Yaçodä, and on the Mathurä and Dvärakä platform the mother of Kåñëa is Devaké. In Mathurä and Dvärakä the love for the Lord is mixed with appreciation of His opulence, but in Våndävana the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not exhibited."

She wanted to deal with her eternal son, Kåñëa, in that stage of love, and therefore she wanted the Supreme Personality of Godhead to withdraw His opulent form of Viñëu. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura illuminates this fact very clearly in his explanation of this verse."

Bhakti may be considered in three stages, called guëé-bhüta, pradhäné-bhüta and kevala, and according to these stages there are three divisions, which are called jïäna, jïänamayé and rati, or premä—that is, simple knowledge, love mixed with knowledge, and pure love. By simple knowledge, one can perceive transcendental bliss without variety. This perception is called mäna-bhüti. When one comes to the stage of jïänamayé, one realizes the transcendental opulences of the Personality of Godhead. But when one reaches pure love, one realizes the transcendental form of the Lord as Lord Kåñëa or Lord Räma. This is what is wanted. Especially in the mädhurya-rasa, one becomes attached to the Personality of Godhead (çré-vigraha-niñöha-rüpädi). Then loving transactions between the Lord and the devotee begin."

Sometimes people cannot understand why Rädhikä's name is not mentioned in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Actually, however, Rädhikä can be understood from the word ärädhana, which indicates that She enjoys the highest loving affairs with Kåñëa."
