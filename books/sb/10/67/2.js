Although Dvivida was an associate of Lord Rämacandra's, he later became corrupted by bad association with the demon Naraka, as stated here: narakasya sakhä. This bad association was the reaction for an offense Dvivida had committed when, being proud of his strength, he disrespected Lord Rämacandra's brother Lakñmaëa and others. Those who worship Lord Rämacandra sometimes chant hymns addressed to Mainda and Dvivida, who are attendant deities of the Lord. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the Mainda and Dvivida mentioned in this verse are empowered expansions of these deities, who are residents of Lord Rämacandra's Vaikuëöha domain."

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté states, however, that the Mainda and Dvivida mentioned here are actually the eternally liberated devotees addressed as attendant deities during the worship of Lord Rämacandra. The Lord arranged their degradation, he says, to show the evil of the bad association that results from offending great personalities. Thus Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté compares the fall of Dvivida and Mainda to that of Jaya and Vijaya."
