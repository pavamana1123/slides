The gopés wanted to go to the forest where Kåñëa was performing His pastimes and, while remaining concealed, peer through the leaves of the creepers and see the wonder of Kåñëa and Balaräma dancing and singing with Their boyfriends. This was their desire, but because they could not go, they sang this song in ecstatic love."
