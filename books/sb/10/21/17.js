    "translation": "The aborigine women of the Våndävana area become disturbed by lust when they see the grass marked with reddish kuìkuma powder.

The aborigine girls had very full breasts, and they were also very lusty, but when their lovers felt their breasts, they were not very satisfied. When they came out into the midst of the forest, they saw that while Kåñëa was walking, some of the leaves and creepers of Våndävana turned reddish from the kuìkuma powder that fell from His lotus feet. His lotus feet were held by the gopés on their breasts, which were also smeared with kuìkuma powder, but when Kåñëa traveled in the Våndävana forest with Balaräma and His boyfriends, the reddish powder fell on the ground of the Våndävana forest. So the lusty aborigine girls, while looking toward Kåñëa playing His flute, saw the reddish kuìkuma on the ground and immediately took it and smeared it over their faces and breasts. In this way they became fully satisfied, although they were not satisfied when their lovers touched their breasts. All material lusty desires can be immediately satisfied if one comes in contact with Kåñëa consciousness.\""
