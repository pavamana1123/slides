    "translation": "When the rivers hear the flute-song of Kåñëa, their minds begin to desire Him, and thus the flow of their currents is broken and their waters are agitated, moving around in whirlpools. Then with the arms of their waves the rivers embrace Muräri's lotus feet and, holding on to them, present offerings of lotus flowers.",

The gopés are implying that since many different types of living beings are overwhelmed by conjugal love for Kåñëa, why should the gopés be criticized for their intense desire to serve Kåñëa in the conjugal relationship?"
