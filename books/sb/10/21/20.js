The vivid example is always present in the behavior of the gopés; therefore Lord Caitanya declared that no one can worship the Supreme Lord by any method that is better than the method of the gopés. The gopés were not born in very high brähmaëa or kñatriya families; they were born in the families of vaiçyas, and not in big mercantile communities but in the families of cowherd men. They were not very well educated, although they heard all sorts of knowledge from the brähmaëas, the authorities of Vedic knowledge. The gopés' only purpose was to remain always absorbed in thoughts of Kåñëa.\""
