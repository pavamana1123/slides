Because of their affection for Kåñëa, they are encouraged by seeing their wives attracted to Him and thus consider their household lives fortunate. Indeed, they become joyful upon seeing how their wives are searching after Kåñëa, and, following along, they urge their wives to go to the Lord. On the other hand, our husbands are jealous of Kåñëa, and because of their lack of devotion to Him they cannot even stand to smell His fragrance. Therefore what is the use of our lives?\""
