    "translation": "My dear gopés, what auspicious activities must the flute have performed to enjoy the nectar of Kåñëa's lips independently and leave only a taste for us gopés, for whom that nectar is actually meant! The forefathers of the flute, the bamboo trees, shed tears of pleasure. His mother, the river on whose bank the bamboo was born, feels jubilation, and therefore her blooming lotus flowers are standing like hair on her body.",

One may object that the trees in Våndävana should not lament for that which is impossible for them to obtain, just as a beggar certainly doesn't lament because he is forbidden to meet the king. But the trees are actually just like intelligent persons who suffer when they cannot obtain the goal of life. Thus the trees are crying because they cannot get the nectar of Kåñëa's lips."
