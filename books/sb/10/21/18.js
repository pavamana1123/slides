O my friends, this hill supplies Kåñëa and Balaräma, along with Their calves, cows and cowherd friends, with all kinds of necessities—water for drinking, very soft grass, caves, fruits, flowers and vegetables. In this way the hill offers respects to the Lord. Being touched by the lotus feet of Kåñëa and Balaräma, Govardhana Hill appears very jubilant.",

            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains the opulence of Govardhana Hill as follows: Pänéya refers to the fragrant, cool water from the Govardhana waterfalls, which Kåñëa and Balaräma drink and use to wash Their feet and mouths. Govardhana also offers other beverages, such as honey, mango juice and pélu juice. Süyavasa indicates dürvä grass, used to make the religious offering of arghya. Govardhana also has grass that is fragrant, soft and conducive to the strong growth of cows and increased production of milk. Thus this grass is used for feeding the transcendental herds. Kandara refers to the caves where Kåñëa, Balaräma and Their friends play, sit and lie down. These caves give pleasure when the weather is too hot or too cold, or when it is raining. Govardhana also features soft roots for eating, jewels for ornamenting the body, flat places for sitting, and lamps and mirrors in the form of smooth stones, glistening water and other natural substances."
