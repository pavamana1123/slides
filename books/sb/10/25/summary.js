Similarly, these cowherd men have become intoxicated by pride and have offended me by taking shelter of an ignorant, ordinary child-Kåñëa.\""

He sent them to harass the Vrajaväsés with downpours of rain and hail. The cowherd community was very disturbed by this and approached Kåñëa for shelter. Understanding that this trouble was the work of Indra, Kåñëa decided to smash to pieces Indra's false prestige, and thus He lifted Govardhana Hill with one hand. He then invited the entire cowherd community to take shelter in the dry space beneath the mountain. For seven successive days He held up the hill, until Indra finally understood Kåñëa's mystic power and ordered the clouds to withdraw."

The cowherds were in ecstasy, showing loving symptoms such as flowing tears and bodily hairs standing on end. They embraced Kåñëa and offered Him benedictions according to their respective positions, while the demigods in heaven rained down flowers and sang the Lord's praises."
