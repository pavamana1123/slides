The äcärya gives the analogy that for a hungry person, the pain of hunger increases the happiness he feels when he finally eats excellent food, and thus hunger can be said to enhance the pleasure of eating. Similarly, the residents of Våndävana, although not experiencing ordinary, material anxiety, felt a type of distress at the activities of Indra and thus intensified their meditation on Kåñëa. When the Lord finally acted, the result was wonderful."
