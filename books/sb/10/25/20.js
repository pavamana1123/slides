However, because the hill was in ecstasy, being touched by the hand of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it acquired inconceivable power and even felt the hundreds of deadly thunderbolts thrown upon its back by angry Indra to be offerings of soft, fragrant flowers. At times Çré Govardhana was not even aware that the thunderbolts were striking. From the Hari-vaàça the äcärya has also quoted Çré Kåñëa Himself as saying, trai-lokyam apy utsahate rakñituà kià punar vrajam: \"Çré Govardhana can give shelter to all the three worlds, what to speak of the simple land of Vraja.\""
