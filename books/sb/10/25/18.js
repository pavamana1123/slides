Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura quotes from the Anekärtha-varga dictionary, çaraëaà gåha-rakñitroù: \"The word çaraëam can represent either home or protector.\" The residents of Våndävana adopted Kåñëa as their beloved child, friend, lover and life itself, and the Lord reciprocated their feelings. Thus Çré Kåñëa lived among these fortunate people, moving in their houses and fields; naturally He would protect such intimate devotees from all types of danger."
