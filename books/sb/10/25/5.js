The äcärya explains: \"Väcälam means 'one who can speak according to Vedic authority.' Bäliçam means 'free from pretension, just like a child.' Stabdham means that He bows down to no one because there is no one for Him to offer homage to, ajïam means that there is nothing more for Him to know because He is omniscient, paëòita-mäninam means that He is highly honored by the knowers of the Absolute Truth, and kåñëam means He is the Supreme Absolute Truth, whose transcendental form is full of eternity and ecstasy. Martyam means that although He is the Absolute Truth, He nevertheless appears in this world as a human being out of affection for His devotees.\""

            "content": "Indra wanted to rebuke Kåñëa as väcälam because the Lord had presented many audacious arguments in the line of Karma-mémäàsä and Säìkhya philosophy even though He did not accept these arguments; thus Indra called the Lord bäliça, \"foolish.\" Indra called Him stabdha because He had spoken boldly even in the presence of His own father. Thus although Indra attempted to criticize Çré Kåñëa, the Lord's transcendental character is in fact impeccable, and this chapter will demonstrate how Indra came to recognize the position of the Lord."
