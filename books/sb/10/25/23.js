Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out that seven days of continuous rain from the Säàvartaka clouds failed to flood the district of Mathurä because the Supreme Lord, simply by His potency, immediately dried up the water as it fell to the ground. Thus Kåñëa's lifting of Govardhana Hill is full of fascinating details and has for thousands of years remained one of His most famous pastimes."
