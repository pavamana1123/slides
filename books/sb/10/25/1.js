Indra was frustrated because the residents of Våndävana accepted Çré Kåñëa as their Lord. But the simple fact is that Çré Kåñëa is the Lord, not only of the residents of Våndävana but of all that exists, including Indra himself. Thus Indra's petulant reaction was ridiculous. As the common saying goes, \"Pride goes before a fall.\""
