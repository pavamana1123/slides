    "translation": "O mother earth, what austerity did you perform to attain the touch of Lord Keçava's lotus feet, which has brought you such great joy that your bodily hairs are standing on end? You appear very beautiful in this condition. Was it during the Lord's current appearance that you acquired this ecstatic symptom, or was it perhaps much earlier, when He stepped upon you in His form of the dwarf Vämanadeva, or even earlier, when He embraced you in His form of the boar Varähadeva?",

Or perhaps, since they will not tell us where Kåñëa has gone, they are hardhearted even though they live in a holy place. Anyway, what is the use of unnecessarily criticizing the residents of a holy place? We cannot tell if they really know where Kåñëa has gone. So let us find someone who definitely knows where He is.' Thus the gopés concluded that since Lord Kåñëa had to be somewhere on the earth, the earth herself must know His whereabouts."

Let us ask her what austerities she has performed to gain the great fortune of being constantly touched by the feet of Lord Keçava.' \""
