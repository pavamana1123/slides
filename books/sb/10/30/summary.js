From all the moving and nonmoving creatures they asked for news of Kåñëa's whereabouts. Finally they became so distraught that they began imitating His pastimes."

Seeing these footprints perturbed them greatly, and they declared that surely Çrématé Rädhäräëé must have worshiped Kåñëa with unusual excellence, since She had been privileged to associate with Him in seclusion. Further along the path the gopés came to a place where they could no longer see Çrématé Rädhäräëé's footprints; they then concluded that Kåñëa must have taken Rädhäräëé onto His shoulders. In another place they noticed that Kåñëa's footprints were showing only the toes, and thus the gopés concluded He had been picking flowers with which to decorate His beloved. In yet another spot the gopés saw signs that led them to imagine that Çré Kåñëa had been tying the locks of Çrématé Rädhäräëé's hair. All these thoughts brought pain to the gopés' minds."

She told Him that She could walk no further and that He would have to carry Her on His shoulders. But just then Lord Kåñëa disappeared from Her sight. Çrématé Rädhäräëé, extremely troubled, then began looking everywhere for Him, and when She finally met Her gopé girlfriends She related to them what had happened. All the gopés then went out to look for Kåñëa in the forest, going as far as the moonlight reached. But in the end they were unsuccessful, so they went back to the shore of the Yamunä and simply sang Kåñëa's glories in utter helplessness."
