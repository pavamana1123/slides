    "translation": "Because the beloved gopés were absorbed in thoughts of their beloved Kåñëa, their bodies imitated His way of moving and smiling, His way of beholding them, His speech and His other distinctive features. Deeply immersed in thinking of Him and maddened by remembering His pastimes, they declared to one another, \"I am Kåñëa!\"",

The gopés were completely absorbed in the existence of Kåñëa and mad with love at their sudden separation from Him, and thus their dedication to Him attained absolute perfection."
