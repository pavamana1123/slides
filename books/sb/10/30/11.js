Conjecturing in this way, the gopés detect a fragrance that has by chance blown their way, and they repeatedly declare with great joy, 'Yes! Yes! This is it! By Kåñëa's physical contact with His girlfriend, His jasmine garland was smeared with the kuìkuma powder on Her breasts, and the fragrances of all these things are reaching us.' Thus the gopés smelled the aroma of the two lovers' bodies, of Kåñëa's jasmine garland, and of the cosmetic powder on the breasts of His lover.\""
