The gopés supposed Kåñëa must have recently passed that way, since the trees were still bowing down. Because Çré Kåñëa had left the gopés to go with His favorite consort, they were jealous and thus imagined that He had become fatigued from His loving affairs and was resting His left arm on the soft shoulder of His beloved. The gopés further imagined that Kåñëa must have been carrying a blue lotus in His right hand to drive away the bees eagerly trying to attack His beloved's face after smelling its aroma. The scene was so beautiful, the gopés imagined, that the maddened bees had left the tulasé garden to follow the two lovers."
