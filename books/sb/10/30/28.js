That he has spoken Her name is indeed Her mercy, and thus the word ärädhitaù is like the rumbling of a kettledrum sounded to announce Her great good fortune.\""

A vertical line extends from the middle of Her foot to the juncture of Her large and second toes. At the base of the middle toe is a lotus, below that is a flag with a banner, and below the flag is a creeper, together with a flower. At the base of Her small toe is an elephant goad, and upon Her heel is a half-moon. Thus there are eleven marks on Her left foot."
