    "translation": "The cowherd community then did all that Madhusüdana had suggested. They arranged for the brähmaëas to recite the auspicious Vedic mantras, and using the paraphernalia that had been intended for Indra's sacrifice, they presented offerings to Govardhana Hill and the brähmaëas with reverential respect. They also gave grass to the cows. Then, placing the cows, bulls and calves in front of them, they circumambulated Govardhana.",

Being the Lord's eternal associates, they were ultimately not concerned with Lord Indra or ritualistic sacrifice, and they were certainly not interested in the mechanistic philosophy that Kåñëa had just spoken to them. They simply loved Kåñëa, and out of intense affection they did exactly what He had requested."

Thus the residents of Våndävana constantly experienced the highest, essential truth underlying all other truths—and that is Çré Kåñëa Himself, the cause of all causes and that which sustains the existence of all that exists. The residents of Våndävana were overwhelmed in loving service to that Supreme Absolute Truth; therefore they were the most fortunate, most intelligent and most pragmatic of all living beings."
