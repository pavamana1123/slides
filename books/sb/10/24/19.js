    "translation": "If one thing is actually sustaining our life but we take shelter of something else, how can we achieve any real benefit? We would be like an unfaithful woman, who can never achieve any actual benefit by consorting with her paramour.",

            "content": "The word kñemam means actual prosperity, not merely the accumulation of money. Here Lord Kåñëa boldly argues that just as a woman can never achieve actual dignity or enlightenment from an illicit lover, the residents of Våndävana will never be happy by neglecting the real source of their prosperity and worshiping Indra instead. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the audacity that child Kåñëa displayed before His father and other elders should be understood as an exhibition of transcendental anger aroused when He saw His eternal devotees worshiping an insignificant demigod."
