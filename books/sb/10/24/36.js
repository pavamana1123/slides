Thus, in His form as a child, Kåñëa led the residents of Våndävana in bowing down to His new incarnation as Govardhana Hill, and to all He pointed out the great mercy bestowed by this divine form of Govardhana. Lord Kåñëa's amazing transcendental activities were certainly in keeping with the festive atmosphere."
