Since everything depends on svabhäva, or one's conditioned nature, why bother worshiping God or the demigods? This argument would be sublime if svabhäva, or conditioned nature, were all-powerful. But unfortunately it is not. There is a supreme controller and we must worship Him, as Lord Kåñëa will emphatically reveal in this chapter of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. For now, however, He is content to tease His relatives."
