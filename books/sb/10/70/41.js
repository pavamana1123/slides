Now please hear me. First of all, may I inform You that King Yudhiñöhira has all material opulences that are possible to achieve in the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka. He has no material opulence for which to aspire, and yet he wants to perform the Räjasüya sacrifice only to get Your association and to please You.... He wants to worship You in order to achieve Your causeless mercy, and I beg to request You to fulfill his desires.\""
