    "translation": "Lord Mädhava would rise during the brähma-muhürta period and touch water. With a clear mind He would then meditate upon Himself, the single, self-luminous, unequaled and infallible Supreme Truth, known as Brahman, who by His very nature ever dispels all contamination, and who through His personal energies, which cause the creation and destruction of this universe, manifests His own pure and blissful existence.",

Thus the compound word lakñita-bhäva-nirvåtim means that Lord Kåñëa gives pleasure to the created beings through His various energies. Of course, the soul is never created, but our material, conditioned existence is created by the interaction of the Lord's energies."

            "content": "One who is favored by the Lord's internal potency can understand the nature of the Absolute Truth; this understanding is called Kåñëa consciousness. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa explains that His energies are divided into inferior and superior, or material and spiritual, potencies. The Brahma-saàhitä further explains that the material potency acts like a shadow, following the movements of the spiritual reality, which is the Lord Himself and His spiritual potency. When one is favored by Lord Kåñëa, He reveals Himself to the surrendered soul, and thus the same creation that formerly covered the soul becomes an impetus for spiritual enlightenment."
