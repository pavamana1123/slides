The specific significance of the assembly house was that anyone who entered it would be free from the six kinds of material pangs, namely hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death. These are the whips of material existence, and as long as one remained in that assembly house of Sudharmä, he would not be affected by these six material whips.\""

Then, at the gateway path of the Sudharmä assembly hall, all the forms of the Lord would merge into a single form, and thus He would enter the hall."
