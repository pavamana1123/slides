After executing the dawn rituals and other religious duties, He would offer oblations into the sacred fire, chant the Gäyatré mantra, worship and pay tribute to the demigods, sages and forefathers, and offer respects to learned brähmaëas. Then He would touch auspicious substances, decorate Himself with celestial ornaments and gratify His subjects by giving them whatever they desired."

When He would take His seat in the assembly, surrounded by the Yädavas, He would appear like the moon surrounded by the circle of stars called nakñatras. Bards would recite His praises to the accompaniment of drums, cymbals, véëäs and other instruments."

The sage accepted a seat, and then Lord Kåñëa gently questioned him: \"Since you travel all over the universe, please inform Us what the Päëòava brothers are planning to do.\" Närada then praised the Supreme Lord and replied, \"King Yudhiñöhira desires to perform the Räjasüya sacrifice. For this he requests Your sanction and presence. Many demigods and illustrious kings will come just to see You.\""
