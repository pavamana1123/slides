Thus, while acting like a human king He allowed Jaräsandha to be victorious in a single battle after the Lord had crushed him seventeen times. The kings here imply that Jaräsandha is especially harassing them because they are souls surrendered to Lord Kåñëa. Therefore they beg the Lord, \"O You who hold the cakra weapon high, please make the proper arrangement.\""

But in Your eighteenth fight You exhibited Your human behavior, and thus it appeared that You were defeated. My dear Lord, we know very well that Jaräsandha cannot defeat You at any time, because Your power, strength, resources and authority are all unlimited. No one can equal You or surpass You. The appearance of defeat by Jaräsandha in the eighteenth engagement is nothing but an exhibition of human behavior. Unfortunately, foolish Jaräsandha could not understand Your tricks, and he has since then become puffed up over his material power and prestige. Specifically, he has arrested us and imprisoned us, knowing fully that as Your devotees, we are subordinate to Your sovereignty.\""
