Although born of a very well-to-do family, They still had to take care of the calves. This was the system of education. Those who were not born in brähmaëa families were not meant for academic education. The brähmaëas were trained in a literary, academic education, the kñatriyas were trained to take care of the state, and the vaiçyas learned how to cultivate the land and take care of the cows and calves. There was no need to waste time going to school to be falsely educated and later increase the numbers of the unemployed. Kåñëa and Balaräma taught us by Their personal behavior. Kåñëa took care of the cows and played His flute, and Balaräma took care of agricultural activities with a plow in His hand."
