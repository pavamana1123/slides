    "translation": "The gopés would say, \"If You dance, my dear Kåñëa, then I shall give You half a sweetmeat.\" By saying these words or by clapping their hands, all the gopés encouraged Kåñëa in different ways. At such times, although He was the supremely powerful Personality of Godhead, He would smile and dance according to their desire, as if He were a wooden doll in their hands. Sometimes He would sing very loudly, at their bidding. In this way, Kåñëa came completely under the control of the gopés.",
