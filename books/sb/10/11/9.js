He exhibited these activities not only to the inhabitants of Vrajabhümi, but also to others, who were captivated by His external potency and opulence. Both the internal devotees, who were simply absorbed in love of Kåñëa, and the external devotees, who were captivated by His unlimited potency, were informed of Kåñëa's desire to be submissive to His servants."
