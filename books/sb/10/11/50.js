    "translation": "Kåñëa, who was the father of Lord Brahmä but who was acting as the son of a cowherd man, became like fire, burning the root of the demon's throat, and the demon Bakäsura immediately disgorged Him. When the demon saw that Kåñëa, although having been swallowed, was unharmed, he immediately attacked Kåñëa again with his sharp beak.",

Although Kåñëa's whole body is sweeter than sugar candy, Bakäsura tasted bitterness and therefore immediately vomited Kåñëa up. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham. When Kåñëa is accepted as an enemy, He becomes the most intolerable object for the nondevotee, who cannot tolerate Kåñëa within or without. Here this is shown by the example of Bakäsura."
