Now let us leave this place and go someplace where we may worship Lord Viñëu undisturbed, before there is another cause of death from some demon who may attack us.\" A devotee desires only that he may execute devotional service undisturbed. Actually we see, however, that even during the presence of Kåñëa, when Nanda Mahäräja and the other cowherd men had the Supreme Personality of Godhead in their presence, there were disturbances. Of course, in every case, Kåñëa came out victorious. The instruction we may derive from this is that we should not be disturbed by so-called disturbances. There have been so many disturbances to our Kåñëa consciousness movement, but we cannot give up our forward march. On the contrary, people are receiving this movement very enthusiastically all over the world, and they are purchasing literature about Kåñëa consciousness with redoubled energy. Thus there are both encouragements and disturbances. This was so even in Kåñëa's time."
