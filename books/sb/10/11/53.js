    "translation": "Just as the senses are pacified when consciousness and life return, so when Kåñëa was freed from this danger, all the boys, including Balaräma, thought that their life had been restored. They embraced Kåñëa in good consciousness, and then they collected their own calves and returned to Vrajabhümi, where they declared the incident loudly.",

They would compose all the stories in poetry or have this done by professional poets, and then they would sing about these incidents. Thus it is written here that the boys sang very loudly."
