Because of intense affection, Nanda Mahäräja could not understand Kåñëa as He is. Garga Muni was able to know everything, past, present and future, by studying the Vedas, but Nanda Mahäräja could not understand Kåñëa directly. Because of his intense love for Kåñëa, he forgot who Kåñëa was and could not understand Kåñëa's potency. Although Kåñëa is Näräyaëa Himself, Garga Muni did not disclose this. Thus Nanda Mahäräja appreciated the words of Garga Muni, but because of his deep affection he could not understand who Kåñëa was, although Garga Muni had said that Kåñëa's qualities would be exactly like those of Näräyaëa."
