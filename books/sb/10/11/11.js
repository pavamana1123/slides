The only condition is that these things should be offered with bhakti (yo me bhaktyä prayacchati). Otherwise, if one is puffed up with false prestige, thinking, \"I have so much opulence, and I am giving something to Kåñëa,\" one's offering will not be accepted by Kåñëa. The fruit vendor, although a woman belonging to the poor aborigine class, dealt with Kåñëa with great affection, saying, \"Kåñëa, You have come to me to take some fruit in exchange for grains. All the grains have fallen, but still You may take whatever You like.\" Thus she filled Kåñëa's palms with whatever fruits He could carry. In exchange, Kåñëa filled her whole basket with jewels and gold."

Then one's life will be successful. Kåñëa is full in all opulences; He does not need anything from anyone. But if one is prepared to give something to Kåñëa, that is for one's own benefit. The example given in this connection is that when one's real face is decorated, the reflection of one's face is automatically decorated. Similarly, if we try to serve Kåñëa with all our opulences, we, as parts and parcels or reflections of Kåñëa, will become happy in exchange. Kåñëa is always happy, for He is ätmäräma, fully satisfied with His own opulence."
