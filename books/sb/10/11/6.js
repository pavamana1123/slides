How then could she have been so cruel as to bind Him to the wooden mortar? Nanda Mahäräja understood this exchange of love, and therefore he smiled and released Kåñëa. In other words, as Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, binds a living entity in fruitive activities, He binds mother Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja in parental affection. This is His pastime."
