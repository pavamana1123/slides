Being surprised, Kåñëa's father, Nanda, and the other elderly inhabitants of Gokula went to the spot, where they saw the fallen trees and Kåñëa standing between them, bound to the ulükhala, the wooden mortar. They could find no cause for the trees' having fallen and Kåñëa's being there. They thought this might be the work of some other asura who had met Kåñëa on this spot, and they inquired from the playmates of Kåñëa about how the whole incident had taken place. The children properly described how everything had happened, but the elderly persons could not believe the story. Some of them, however, thought that it might be true, since they had already seen many wonderful incidents in connection with Kåñëa. Anyway, Nanda Mahäräja immediately released Kåñëa from the ropes."

On the way, almost all the grains fell from His palms, only one or two grains remaining, but the fruit vendor, out of full affection, accepted these grains in exchange for as much fruit as Kåñëa could take. As soon as she did this, her basket became filled with gold and jewels."

They decided to go to Våndävana, Vraja-dhäma, and the next day they all departed. In Våndävana, both Kåñëa and Balaräma, after finishing Their childhood pastimes, began to take charge of the calves and send them to the pasturing grounds (go-caraëa). During this time, a demon named Vatsäsura entered among the calves and was killed, and another asura, in the shape of a big duck, was also killed. The playmates of Kåñëa narrated all these stories to their mothers. The mothers could not believe their children, Kåñëa's playmates, but because of full affection they enjoyed these narrations of Kåñëa's activities."
