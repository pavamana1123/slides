Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä in Våndävana appeared like ordinary persons of this material world, but they never felt the tribulations of this world, although they sometimes met many dangerous situations created by the demons. This is a practical example. If we follow in the footsteps of Nanda Mahäräja and the gopas, we can all be happy simply by discussing the activities of Kåñëa."

Even at the present moment, everyone everywhere can be happy and free from material tribulations by following Çrémad-Bhägavatam. There is no need of austerities and penances, which in this age are very difficult to perform. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has therefore declared, sarvätma-snapanaà paraà vijayate çré-kåñëa-saìkértanam. By our Kåñëa consciousness movement, we are trying to distribute Çrémad-Bhägavatam so that anyone in any part of the world can be absorbed in the Kåñëa consciousness movement by chanting and hearing about the activities of Kåñëa and be free from all material tribulations."
