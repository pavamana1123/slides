Lord Çiva appears in a special liìga form in each of these sixteen substances, which are worshiped individually as deities in various sacred locations of the universe. A devotee of Çiva may worship one of his particular liìgas to obtain the mystic opulences pertaining to it. Thus Lord Çiva's äkäça-liìga bestows the opulences of ether, his jyotir-liìga bestows the opulences of fire, and so on."
