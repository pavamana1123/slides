When Mahäräja Parékñit asked Çukadeva Gosvämé to explain this puzzling fact, the sage replied as follows: \"Lord Çiva manifests as false ego in three varieties, according to the three modes of nature. From this false ego arise the five physical elements and the other transformations of material nature, totaling sixteen. When a devotee of Lord Çiva worships his manifestation in any of these elements, the devotee obtains all sorts of corresponding enjoyable opulences. But because Lord Çré Hari is transcendental to the modes of material nature, His devotees also become transcendental.\""

Then the poverty-stricken man's children, wife and other relations all abandon him. When he again tries to acquire wealth in order to win back his family's favor, I mercifully frustrate him so that he becomes disgusted with fruitive work and befriends My devotees. And at that time I bestow upon him My extraordinary grace; then he can become freed from the bondage of material life and attain to the kingdom of God, Vaikuëöha.\""

            "content": "Lord Brahmä, Lord Viñëu and Lord Çiva can each bestow or withhold favors, but whereas Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva are satisfied or angered very quickly, Lord Viñëu is not. In this regard the Vedic literature relates the following account: Once the demon Våka asked Närada which god was most quickly pleased, and Närada answered that Lord Çiva was. Thus Våkäsura went to the holy place of Kedäranätha and began worshiping Lord Çiva by offering pieces of his own flesh as oblations into the fire. But Çiva did not appear. So Våka decided to commit suicide by cutting off his head. Just at the critical moment, Lord Çiva appeared from the sacrificial fire and stopped him, offering the demon whatever boon he chose. Våka said, \"May death come to whomever I touch upon the head with my hand.\" Lord Çiva was obliged to fulfill this request, and at once the wicked Våka tried to test the benediction by putting his hand on the lord's head. Terrified, Çiva fled for his life, running as far as heaven and the outer limits of the mortal world. Finally the lord reached the planet of Çvetadvépa, where Lord Viñëu resides. Seeing the desperate Çiva from afar, the Lord disguised Himself as a young student and went before Våkäsura. In a sweet voice he addressed the demon: \"My dear Våka, please rest awhile and tell Us what you intend to do.\" Våka was charmed by the Lord's words and revealed everything that had happened. The Lord said, \"Ever since Lord Çiva was cursed by Prajäpati Dakña, he has become just like a carnivorous hobgoblin. So you shouldn't trust his word. Better to test his benediction by putting your hand on your own head.\" Bewildered by these words, the foolish demon touched his own head, which immediately shattered and fell to the ground. Cries of \"Victory!\" \"Obeisances!\" and \"Well done!\" were heard from the sky, and the demigods, sages, celestial forefathers and Gandharvas all congratulated the Supreme Lord by raining down flowers upon Him."
