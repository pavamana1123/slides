In this regard Mahäräja Parékñit here expresses a common fear among ordinary people that by becoming a devotee of Lord Viñëu one will lose his wealth and social status. For the benefit of such persons of little faith, King Parékñit requests Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé to explain an apparent paradox: Lord Çiva, who lives like a beggar, without even a house to call his own, makes his devotees rich and powerful, while Lord Viñëu, the omnipotent possessor of all that exists, often reduces His servants to abject poverty. Çukadeva Gosvämé will respond with reasoned explanations and an ancient account concerning the demon Våka."
