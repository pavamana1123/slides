Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, in Çré Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu, his definitive treatise on the process of devotional service, explains how a Vaiñëava is relieved of all karmic reactions, including those that have not yet begun to manifest (aprärabdha), those that are just about to manifest (küöa), those that are barely manifesting (béja) and those that have manifested fully (prärabdha). As a lotus gradually loses its many petals, so a person who takes shelter of devotional service has all his karmic reactions destroyed."

It consists of fixing the mind upon Him by becoming disinterested in all material designations, both in this life and the next. It results in the dissolution of all karma.\" While it is certainly true that those who practice devotional service remain in material bodies and apparently material situations for some time, this is simply an expression of the inconceivable mercy of the Lord, who bestows the fruits of devotion only when it has become pure. In every stage of devotion, however, the Lord watches over His devotee and sees to the gradual elimination of his karma. Thus despite the fact that the happiness and distress devotees experience resemble ordinary karmic reactions, they are in fact given by the Lord Himself. As the Bhägavatam  states, bhavad-uttha-çubhäçubhayoù: A mature devotee recognizes the superficially good and bad conditions he encounters as signs of the direct guidance of his ever well-wishing Lord."

This is answered by an analogy: A very affectionate father takes the responsibility of restricting his children's play and making them go to school. He knows that this is a genuine expression of his love for them, even if the children fail to understand. Similarly, the Supreme Lord Viñëu is mercifully strict with all His dependents, not only with immature devotees struggling to become qualified. Even perfect saints like Prahläda, Dhruva and Yudhiñöhira were subjected to great tribulations, all for their glorification. After the Battle of Kurukñetra, Çré Bhéñmadeva described to King Yudhiñöhira his wonder at this:"

Material happiness and distress, arising from karma, leave a subtle residue—the seed of future entanglement. Such enjoyment and suffering tend toward degradation and increase the danger of falling into hellish oblivion. Happiness and distress generated from the Supreme Lord's desires, however, leave no trace after their immediate purpose has been served. Moreover, the Vaiñëava who enjoys such reciprocation with the Lord is in no danger of falling down into nescience. As Yamaräja, the lord of death and the judge of all departed souls, declares,"

Please listen: It is at night that the sunrise becomes attractive, during the hot summer that cold water gives comfort, and during the cold winter months that warm water is pleasing. Lamplight appears attractive in darkness, not in the glaring light of day, and when one is distressed by hunger, food tastes especially good.\" In other words, to strengthen his devotees' mood of dependence on Him and longing for Him, the Lord arranges for His devotees to go through some suffering, and when He appears in order to deliver them, their gratitude and transcendental pleasure are boundless."
