Indeed, what living being can hope for good fortune if he offends exalted saints, what to speak of offending the lord and spiritual master of the universe?\"",

You could have been killed! But you were only concerned about saving this poor soul, so you disregarded what would happen to you as a result.\" Thus, Äcärya Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out, Lord Näräyaëa's mild rebuke also highlighted Lord Çiva's exceptional compassion."
