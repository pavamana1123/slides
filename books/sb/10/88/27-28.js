    "translation": "The Supreme Lord, who relieves His devotees' distress, had seen from afar that Lord Çiva was in danger. Thus by His mystic Yogamäyä potency He assumed the form of a brahmacäré student, with the appropriate belt, deerskin, rod and prayer beads, and came before Våkäsura. The Lord's effulgence glowed brilliantly like fire. Holding kuça grass in His hand, He humbly greeted the demon.",
