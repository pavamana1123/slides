    "translation": "But the reason I do not immediately reciprocate the affection of living beings even when they worship Me, O gopés, is that I want to intensify their loving devotion. They then become like a poor man who has gained some wealth and then lost it, and who thus becomes so anxious about it that he can think of nothing else.",

In fact, the Lord is truly reciprocating. After all, a sincere devotee always prays to the Lord, \"Please help me to love You purely.\" Therefore the Lord's so-called neglect is actually the fulfillment of the devotee's prayer. Lord Kåñëa intensifies our love for Him by apparently separating Himself from us, and the result is that we achieve what we really wanted and prayed for: intense love for the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa. Thus Lord Kåñëa's apparent negligence is actually His thoughtful reciprocation and the fulfillment of our deepest and purest desire."

Even as Lord Kåñëa was speaking, the gopés had begun to realize that He was bringing them to the highest perfection of loving service."
