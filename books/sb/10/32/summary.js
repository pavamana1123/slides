Some of the gopés, overwhelmed with ecstasy at seeing Him, grasped His hands, others placed His arm on their shoulders, and others accepted the remnants of betel nut He had chewed. Thus they served Him."

            "content": "One gopé, impelled by loving anger toward Kåñëa, bit her lip and looked askance at Him. Because the gopés were so attached to Kåñëa, they were not satiated even by continuously gazing at Him. One of them then placed Kåñëa within her heart, closed her eyes and, embracing Him within herself again and again, became absorbed in transcendental bliss, just like a yogé. In this way the pain the gopés had felt because of separation from the Lord was dispelled."

            "content": "Next Lord Kåñëa went to the bank of the Yamunä in the company of the cowherd girls, His internal potencies. The gopés then made a seat for Kåñëa out of their shawls, and after He had sat down they enjoyed with Him by gesturing amorously. The gopés still felt hurt that Kåñëa had disappeared, so He explained to them why He had done so. He further told them that He had come under the exclusive control of their loving devotion and would ever remain indebted to them."
