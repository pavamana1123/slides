Later on in this canto we find that when Lord Kåñëa once took a pärijäta flower from Indra's kingdom, poor Indra again reacted violently against the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, we should aspire to go back to our eternal home in the kingdom of Kåñëa, and should not become entangled in the imperfect life of the material gods."
