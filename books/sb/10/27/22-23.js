    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: Having thus appealed to Lord Kåñëa, mother Surabhi performed His bathing ceremony with her own milk, and Indra, ordered by Aditi and other mothers of the demigods, anointed the Lord with heavenly Gaìgä water from the trunk of Indra's elephant carrier, Airävata. Thus, in the company of the demigods and great sages, Indra coronated Lord Kåñëa, the descendant of Daçärha, and gave Him the name Govinda.",

Therefore the heavenly mothers, such as Aditi, encouraged him to go ahead and do so. Feeling authorized by the encouragement of demigods less offensive than he, Indra then bathed the Lord. Indra discovered that the beautiful cowherd boy named Kåñëa is indeed the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
