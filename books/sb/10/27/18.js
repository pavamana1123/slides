Although Lord Kåñëa's cows are transcendental, the heavenly cow Surabhi affectionately saw them, as indeed Lord Kåñëa Himself did, as related to her. Since Lord Kåñëa was appearing in the form of a cowherd boy, the whole situation was quite congenial, and Surabhi took the opportunity to offer the following prayers."
