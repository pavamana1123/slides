Since Brahmä has ordered her, her attempt to coronate Lord Kåñëa as her personal Lord is authorized by higher authority. Moreover, Lord Kåñëa Himself comes down to the earth to relieve the burden of self-destructive, mundane administration, and thus it is perfectly consistent with the Lord's own purpose that He become the Lord of Surabhi. Since the Lord rules millions of universes, He can certainly take care of mother Surabhi."
