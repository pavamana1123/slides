But Indra abused his authority, and now Surabhi requests Lord Kåñëa, the Absolute Truth, to directly become her Lord, her Indra. We should carefully perform our duties without false pride; thus we will not become obsolete and embarrassed, as in the present case of King Indra, who actually attacked Lord Kåñëa and His Våndävana devotees."
