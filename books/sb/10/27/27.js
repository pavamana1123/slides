Unfortunately, modern man has created a hell on earth in his cynical rejection of heaven on earth, which is actually possible through Kåñëa consciousness. The situation described here, created simply by the auspicious bathing ceremony of the Lord, is an authentic historical incident. Since history repeats itself, there is hope that the Kåñëa consciousness movement may again bring the world community to the brilliant reality of self-realized existence."
