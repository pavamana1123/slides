As indicated by this verse, Lord Kåñëa had to adopt extraordinary measures to protect His Våndävana associates from Indra's obnoxious and offensive attack. Certainly Indra was ashamed, and also nervous about his future. Having acted improperly, he had fearfully gone to seek the shelter of Lord Brahmä, who then ordered him to take along Surabhi from the material Goloka planet and go to see Kåñëa."
