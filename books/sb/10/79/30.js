They understood that Lord Balaräma, although a kñatriya, was now retired from the fighting business. The brähmaëas and the sages, who were always for peace and tranquillity, were very pleased at this. All of them embraced Balaräma with great affection and induced Him to perform various kinds of sacrifices in that sacred spot of Naimiñäraëya. Actually Lord Balaräma had no business performing the sacrifices recommended for ordinary human beings; He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He Himself is the enjoyer of all such sacrifices. As such, His exemplary action in performing sacrifices was only to give a lesson to the common man, to show how one should abide by the injunctions of the Vedas.\""
