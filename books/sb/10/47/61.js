    "translation": "The gopés of Våndävana have given up the association of their husbands, sons and other family members, who are very difficult to give up, and they have forsaken the path of chastity to take shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, Kåñëa, which one should search for by Vedic knowledge. Oh, let me be fortunate enough to be one of the bushes, creepers or herbs in Våndävana, because the gopés trample them and bless them with the dust of their lotus feet.",

            "content": "Çré Uddhava here shows the perfect Vaiñëava attitude of humility. He does not pray to be equal to the gopés in their exalted stage of love, but rather to take birth as a bush or creeper in Våndävana so that when they walk upon him he will get the dust of their feet and thus be blessed. The shy gopés would never agree to give such blessings to a great personality like Uddhava; therefore he cleverly sought to get such mercy by taking birth as a plant in Våndävana."
