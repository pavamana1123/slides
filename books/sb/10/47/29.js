    "translation": "The Supreme Lord said: You are never actually separated from Me, for I am the Soul of all creation. Just as the elements of nature—ether, air, fire, water and earth—are present in every created thing, so I am present within everyone's mind, life air and senses, and also within the physical elements and the modes of material nature.",

The Supreme Lord was secretly telling the gopés that He, by way of reciprocating their special love for Him, was present with them, not only as the Soul of all creation but also as their special lover. In this sense of the verse, the word guëa indicates the gopés' special divine qualities, which attracted Çré Kåñëa, and the word sarvätmanä, which we have here translated in reference to Lord Kåñëa Himself (corresponding to the word me, which is also in the instrumental case), is also understood in the sense of sarvathä, or \"completely.\" In other words, although in one sense Lord Kåñëa was absent, He could never be completely absent, since in His spiritual form He is always in the hearts and minds of the gopés."

In fact, the Lord was spiritually present with the gopés, since they are His eternal associates."

            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté further points out that foolish persons will conclude that Çré Kåñëa's use of philosophical language meant that the Lord was trying to bring the gopés to the point of liberation by explaining basic points of Kåñëa conscious philosophy. In truth, the gopés are the most exalted liberated souls, and their pastimes with Çré Kåñëa must be understood with the help of authorized äcäryas. When the gopés came for the räsa dance, Çré Kåñëa tried to preach karma-yoga to them, emphasizing ordinary ethics and morality, but the gopés were beyond that. Similarly, Lord Kåñëa now offers them jïäna-yoga, or metaphysical philosophy, but this is also inadequate for the gopés, who have achieved spontaneous, unalloyed love for Çré Kåñëa."
