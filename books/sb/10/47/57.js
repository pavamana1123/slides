            "content": "Viklava, \"mental disturbance,\" should not be confused here with ordinary material distress. It is clearly stated that Uddhava was supremely pleased, and he felt this way because he saw that the gopés had attained the highest state of loving ecstasy. Uddhava was an exalted member of the court in Dvärakä, an important minister in world political affairs, and yet he felt the spiritual urge to offer his obeisances to the glorious gopés, although externally they were mere cowherd girls in an insignificant village called Våndävana. Thus, to explain his feelings he sang the following verses. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé states that Uddhava sang these verses daily while he was in Våndävana."
