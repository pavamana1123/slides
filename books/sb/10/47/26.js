History shows that the gopés remained in Våndävana, living in their houses with their families. However, unlike ordinary persons, they entirely renounced the egoistical sense of possession of sons, husbands and so on. They never tried to enjoy them but rather gave their whole heart and mind to the Supreme Lord, as recommended in the great religious scriptures of the world. Following the example of the gopés, we should love the Supreme Lord with all of our heart, soul and might."
