Thinking \"Who is this?\" they approached and encircled him. When they realized that Kåñëa must have sent him, they brought him to a secluded place where he could speak to them confidentially."

One gopé, while deeply meditating on Her association with Kåñëa, noticed a bumblebee before Her. Imagining the bee to be a messenger from Him, She said, \"Just as bees wander among various flowers, Çré Kåñëa has abandoned the young girls of Vraja and developed affection for other women.\" The gopé continued to speak in this way, contrasting Her own supposed ill fortune to Her rival lovers' good fortune, all the while glorifying the names, forms, qualities and pastimes of Lord Kåñëa. She then declared that although Kåñëa may have abandoned the gopés, they could not possibly stop remembering Him for even a moment."

Uddhava explained, \"While ordinary persons must perform many pious deeds to qualify as servants of Lord Kåñëa, you simple cowherd girls are so extremely fortunate that the Lord has favored you with the very highest degree of pure devotion for Him.\" Uddhava then related to them the Lord's message."

I am indeed most dear to you gopés, but to increase your attraction for Me and intensify your remembrance of Me, I left you. After all, when a woman's beloved is far away, she fixes her mind upon him constantly. By incessantly remembering Me, you are sure to regain My association without delay.' \""

Does He still remember all the pastimes He enjoyed with us, such as the räsa dance? Will Çré Kåñëa once again appear before us and give us ecstasy, just as Lord Indra, with his rain, gives life back to the forests aggrieved by the summer heat? Although we know that the greatest happiness comes from renunciation, we simply cannot stop hoping to attain Kåñëa, for the marks of His lotus feet are still present throughout the land of Vraja, reminding us of His graceful gait, generous smiles and gentle talks. By all these our hearts have been stolen away.\""

Very satisfied at seeing the extent of the gopés' love for the Lord, he declared, \"These cowherd girls have perfected their lives by coming to the platform of unalloyed love for Kåñëa. Indeed, even Lord Brahmä is inferior to them. The goddess of fortune herself, who always resides on Kåñëa's chest, could not get the same mercy as that which the gopés obtained during the räsa dance, when Kåñëa embraced their necks with His mighty arms. What, then, to speak of other women! Indeed, I would consider myself most fortunate to take birth as even a bush or creeper that would sometimes be touched by the dust of these gopés' lotus feet.\""

Returning to Mathurä, Uddhava offered Balaräma, Kåñëa and King Ugrasena the gifts sent by Nanda Mahäräja and described to them everything he had experienced in Vraja."
