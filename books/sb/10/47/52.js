Leave Våndävana, and then you won't have to see these rivers, mountains and forests. Cover your eyes with your garments, use your intelligence to lead your minds to some other thought, and thus forget Kåñëa.\" The gopés answer this suggestion in the previous verse by stating, \"We no longer possess our intelligence, for Kåñëa has taken it away by His supreme beauty and charm.\""

            "content": "Now in the present verse the feelings of the gopés become so strong that they disregard Uddhava and, turning toward Mathurä, address Kåñëa Himself with humble cries. They address Kåñëa as Vrajanätha because in the past young Kåñëa performed many inconceivable pastimes to protect His beloved village people, such as lifting Govardhana Hill and destroying many monstrous demons. In this heartrending verse, the gopés cry out to Kåñëa to remember the wonderful, sweet relationship they once enjoyed together as innocent village people. Indeed, Çré Kåñëa would lovingly take care of His father's cows, and the gopés appealed to Him to remember these duties and return so He could resume them."
