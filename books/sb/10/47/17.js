    "translation": "Like a hunter, He cruelly shot the king of the monkeys with arrows. Because He was conquered by a woman, He disfigured another woman who came to Him with lusty desires. And even after consuming the gifts of Bali Mahäräja, He bound him up with ropes as if he were a crow. So let us give up all friendship with this dark-complexioned boy, even if we can't give up talking about Him.",

            "content": "In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda explains the meaning of this verse as follows: \"[Çrématé Rädhäräëé said to the bee,] 'You poor messenger, you are only a less intelligent servant. You do not know much about Kåñëa—how ungrateful and hardhearted He has been, not only in this life but in His previous lives also. We have heard this from Our grandmother Paurëamäsé. She has informed Us that Kåñëa was born in a kñatriya family previous to this birth and was known as Rämacandra. In that birth, instead of killing Välé, an enemy of His friend, in the manner of a kñatriya, He killed him just like a hunter. A hunter takes a secure hiding place and then kills an animal without facing it. So Lord Rämacandra, as a kñatriya, should have fought with Välé face to face, but instigated by His friend, He killed him from behind a tree. Thus He deviated from the religious principles of a kñatriya. Also, He was so attracted by the beauty of Sétä that He converted Çürpaëakhä, the sister of Rävaëa, into an ugly woman by cutting off her nose and ears. Çürpaëakhä proposed an intimate relationship with Him, and as a kñatriya He should have satisfied her. But He was so henpecked that He could not forget Sétä-devé and converted Çürpaëakhä into an ugly woman. Before that birth as a kñatriya, He took birth as a brähmaëa boy known as Vämanadeva and asked charity from Bali Mahäräja. Bali was so magnanimous that he gave Him whatever he had, yet Kåñëa as Vämanadeva ungratefully arrested him just like a crow and pushed him down to the Pätäla kingdom. We know all about Kåñëa and how ungrateful He is. But here is the difficulty: In spite of His being so cruel and hardhearted, it is very difficult for us to give up talking about Him.' \""
