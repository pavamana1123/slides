Nowhere else in the universe could one find such a charming scene as the Våndävana forest, which was scented with pious flowers and illumined by the full moon's light reflected from the serene waves of the sacred Yamunä River. No one loved Kåñëa as much as the gopés, and thus no one else could understand Him as well. The gopés rendered intimate service to Kåñëa that only they could perfect. Thus the gopés were distraught to think that Lord Kåñëa was bereft of Våndävana and bereft of their service. Free of all material lust, they were overwhelmed with disappointment because they could not give Kåñëa happiness by their loving service. They simply could not imagine Kåñëa enjoying anywhere else as He did in Våndävana in their company.\""
