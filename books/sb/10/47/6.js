    "translation": "The friendship shown toward others—those who are not family members—is motivated by personal interest, and thus it is a pretense that lasts only until one's purpose is fulfilled. Such friendship is just like the interest men take in women, or bees in flowers.",

And as bees drink only once of a flower's nectar and then leave it for another, fickle men abandon beautiful and devoted women to pursue other pleasures. This tendency is condemned here by the gopés, who gave their hearts completely to Çré Kåñëa. The gopés wanted only to exhibit their charms for Lord Kåñëa's pleasure, and in the pain of separation they questioned the motives of His friendship with them."

            "content": "These are the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Both Lord Kåñëa and the gopés are completely liberated souls engaged in spiritual loving affairs. By contrast, our so-called loving affairs, being perverted reflections of the perfect loving relationships in the spiritual world, are polluted with lust, greed, pride and so on. Like all liberated souls, the gopés—and certainly Lord Kåñëa Himself—are eternally free of these lower qualities, and their intense loving affairs are motivated exclusively by unalloyed devotion."
