    "translation": "To hear about the pastimes that Kåñëa regularly performs is nectar for the ears. For those who relish just a single drop of that nectar, even once, their dedication to material duality is ruined. Many such persons have suddenly given up their wretched homes and families and, themselves becoming wretched, traveled here to Våndävana to wander about like birds, begging for their living.",

In fact, there is one Absolute Truth, in which we all exist and to whom everything belongs. His beauty and pleasure are also absolute and infinite, and if one actually hears about this Absolute Truth, called Kåñëa, one's dedication to the illusion of mundane duality is spoiled."

Then the entire line becomes part of a single compound, the meaning of which is that hearing about Kåñëa cleanses one of irreligious duality and thus one is not vanquished (avinañöa) by material illusion. The word dénäù is then given the alternate reading of dhéräù, meaning that one becomes spiritually sober and thus gives up attachment to fleeting material relationships. The word vihaìgäù, \"birds,\" would in this case refer to swans, the symbol of essential discrimination."
