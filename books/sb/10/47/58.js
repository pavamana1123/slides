    "translation": "[Uddhava sang:] Among all persons on earth, these cowherd women alone have actually perfected their embodied lives, for they have achieved the perfection of unalloyed love for Lord Govinda. Their pure love is hankered after by those who fear material existence, by great sages, and by ourselves as well. For one who has tasted the narrations of the infinite Lord, what is the use of taking birth as a high-class brähmaëa, or even as Lord Brahmä himself?",

These cannot compare to pure Kåñëa consciousness. In fact, Çré Uddhava, who spoke this verse, took birth as a pure brähmaëa, but he deprecates this position in comparison to that of the exalted gopés."
