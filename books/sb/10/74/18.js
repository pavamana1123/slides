This particular ceremony is called agra-püjä. Agra means 'first,' and püjä means 'worship.' This agra-püjä is similar to the election of a president. In the sacrificial assembly, all the members were very exalted. Some proposed to elect one person as the perfect candidate for accepting agra-püjä, and others proposed someone else."

            "content": "As the great äcärya Jéva Gosvämé points out, Text 15 of this chapter states that the members of the assembly were not astonished at the opulence of the sacrifice, since they knew that King Yudhiñöhira was a devotee of Lord Kåñëa. Still, Text 18 now states that the assembly could not select the most deserving candidate for being worshiped first. This indicates that many of the brähmaëas present were not fully realized transcendentalists but rather conventional brähmaëas uncertain of the supreme conclusion of Vedic wisdom."

Furthermore, here is Sahadeva, who is renowned for his sharp skill in analyzing all sorts of circumstances. He can help appoint the person who is to be worshiped first. Only if he somehow fails to speak or cannot understand the situation will we speak up, despite no one's having inquired from us.\" Having made up their minds in this way, the greatest personalities remained silent. This is how Viçvanätha Cakravarté advises us to understand what occurred in the assembly."
