Thus to most observers it appeared that Çiçupäla achieved the impersonal liberation of merging into Lord Kåñëa's bodily effulgence. In fact, after being liberated from his mortal frame, Çiçupäla returned to the side of his master, the Supreme Lord of the spiritual world. The following verse further explains this."
