Sahadeva spoke up: \"Çré Kåñëa, the Supreme Lord, is indeed the most exalted person, for He Himself comprises all the deities worshiped by Vedic sacrifice. In His role as the Supersoul in the heart, He arranges for everyone in the universe to engage in his particular kind of work, and by His mercy alone human beings can perform various kinds of pious activities and receive the resultant benefits. One who worships Him worships all living entities. Surely Lord Kåñëa should be worshiped first.\""

After bathing His feet, the King took the wash water and sprinkled it on his head, and his wives, younger brothers, ministers and relatives also sprinkled that water on their heads. Then everyone shouted, \"All victory, all victory!\" and bowed down to Lord Kåñëa as flowers rained down from above."

He stood up from his seat and harshly rebuked the wise elders for choosing Kåñëa to be worshiped first. \"After all\" he said, \"this Kåñëa is outside the system of Vedic social and spiritual orders and the society of respectable families. He follows no principles of religion and has no good qualities.\""

But many members of the assembly covered their ears and quickly left the hall, while the Päëòava brothers raised their weapons and prepared to kill Çiçupäla. Lord Kåñëa stopped them from attacking, however, and instead used His Sudarçana disc to decapitate the offender. At that moment an effulgent spark of light rose out of Çiçupäla's dead body and entered the transcendental body of Lord Kåñëa. Having lived through three births as the enemy of the Lord, Çiçupäla now attained the liberation of säyujya, merging into Him, by dint of his constant meditation on Him."
