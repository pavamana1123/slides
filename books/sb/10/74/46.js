Because of an offense, the four Kumäras cursed them to take three births in the material world as demons. The first birth was as Hiraëyäkña and Hiraëyakaçipu, the second as Rävaëa and Kumbhakarëa, and the third as Çiçupäla and Dantavakra. In each birth they were completely absorbed in enmity toward the Lord and were slain by Him."

He was always absorbed in thought of Kåñëa, and thus he got first the salvation of säyujya-mukti, merging into the existence of the Supreme, and finally became reinstated in his original position of personal service.
