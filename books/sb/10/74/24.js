Since everyone is part and parcel of Kåñëa, there is no qualitative difference between Kåñëa and all living entities. Everything is an emanation of Kåñëa's energies, the material and spiritual energies. Kåñëa's energies are like the heat and light of the fire; there is no difference between the quality of heat and light and the fire itself.... He should therefore be offered the first worship of this great sacrifice, and no one should disagree. Kåñëa is present as the Supersoul in every living being, and if we can satisfy Him, then automatically every living being becomes satisfied.' \""
