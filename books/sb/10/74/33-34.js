How does this cowherd boy, the disgrace of His family, deserve your worship, any more than a crow deserves to eat the sacred puroòäça rice cake?",

            "content": "The great commentator Çrédhara Svämé has analyzed Çiçupäla's words as follows. The term go-päla means not only \"cowherd\" but also \"protector of the Vedas and the earth.\" Similarly, kula-päàsana has a double meaning. Çiçupäla intended it to mean \"the disgrace of His family,\" which is its meaning when divided as above. But the word may also be analyzed as ku-lapäm aàsana, giving a totally different meaning. Kulapäm indicates those who prattle with crooked words contrary to the Vedas, and aàsana, derived from the verb aàsayati, means \"destroyer.\" In other words, he was praising Lord Kåñëa as \"He who vanquishes all misguided and frivolous speculations about the nature of truth.\" Similarly, although Çiçupäla wanted to compare Lord Kåñëa to a crow with the words yathä käkaù, these words may also be divided yathä a-käkaù. In that case, according to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the word käka is a combination of ka and äka, which indicate material happiness and misery. Thus Lord Kåñëa is akäka in the sense that He is beyond all material misery and happiness, being on the pure, transcendental platform. Finally, Çiçupäla was right in saying the Lord Kåñëa does not deserve merely the puroòäça rice cake, offered to the lesser demigods as a substitute for the heavenly beverage soma. In fact, Lord Kåñëa deserves to receive everything that we possess, since He is the ultimate proprietor of everything, including ourselves. Thus we should give Lord Kåñëa our life and soul, not merely a ritualistic offering of rice cakes."
