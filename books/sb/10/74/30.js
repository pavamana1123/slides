He was an avowed enemy of Kåñëa for many reasons, especially because of Kåñëa's having stolen Rukmiëé from the marriage ceremony; therefore, he could not tolerate such honor to Kåñëa and glorification of His qualities. Instead of being happy to hear the glories of the Lord, he became very angry.\""

            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté mentions that the reason Çiçupäla did not object when Sahadeva proposed Kåñëa for the agra-püjä is that Çiçupäla wanted to ruin King Yudhiñöhira's sacrifice. If Çiçupäla had argued earlier against Lord Kåñëa's receiving the first worship and another person had been selected, the sacrifice would have then proceeded normally. Therefore Çiçupäla allowed Kåñëa to be selected, waited until the worship was over, and then spoke up, hoping in this way to demonstrate that the sacrifice was now spoiled. Thus he would ruin the endeavor of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. In this regard the äcärya quotes the following småti reference: apüjyä yatra püjyante püjyänäà ca vyatikramaù. \"In the place where those who are not to be worshiped are worshiped, there is offense to those who are actually worshipable.\" There is also the following statement: pratibadhnäti hi çreyaù püjyapüjya-vyatikramaù. \"Improperly understanding who is to be worshiped and who is not to be worshiped will impede one's progress in life.\""
