The gopés are not victims of material lust, but rather they are absorbed in pure love of Godhead and thus want to serve Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet by offering their beautiful breasts to Him. Materialistic persons, who are victims of mundane sex desire, will not be able to understand how these conjugal dealings take place on a pure, spiritual platform, and that is the materialists' great misfortune."
