    "translation": "Your lotus feet destroy the past sins of all embodied souls who surrender to them. Those feet follow after the cows in the pastures and are the eternal abode of the goddess of fortune. Since You once put those feet on the hoods of the great serpent Käliya, please place them upon our breasts and tear away the lust in our hearts.",

The Lord is so merciful that He even goes out to herd the cows in the pasturing ground, and thus His lotus feet follow them about in the grass. He has offered His lotus feet to the goddess of fortune and has placed them upon the hoods of the serpent Käliya. Therefore, considering all this, the Lord should place His lotus feet on the gopés' breasts and satisfy their desire. That is the logic the gopés employ here."
