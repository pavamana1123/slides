Akrüra gave up his pride in being an aristocratic member of society and worshiped the cowherd residents of the simple village of Våndävana. And he gave up lamenting for his house, wife and family, which were in danger from King Kaàsa. Giving up all these things, he rolled in the dust of the lotus feet of God."
