As he traveled, he thought as follows: \"I am about to attain the great good fortune of seeing Çré Kåñëa's lotus feet, which are worshiped by Brahmä, Rudra and the other demigods. Although Kaàsa is an enemy of the Supreme Lord and His devotees, still, it is by Kaàsa's grace that I will get this great boon of seeing the Lord. When I first catch sight of His lotus feet, all my sinful reactions will be destroyed at once. I will descend from my chariot and fall at the feet of Kåñëa and Balaräma, and even though I have been sent by Kaàsa, the omniscient Çré Kåñëa will certainly harbor no animosity toward me.\" As Akrüra thus thought to himself, he arrived in Gokula at sunset. Alighting from his chariot in the cowherd pasture, he began rolling about in the dust in great ecstasy."

Afterward They brought him to Their residence, inquired from him about the comfort of his trip and honored him in various ways-offering him water for washing his feet, arghya, a seat and so forth. They relieved him of his fatigue by massaging his feet and served him a delicious banquet. Mahäräja Nanda also honored Akrüra with many sweet words."
