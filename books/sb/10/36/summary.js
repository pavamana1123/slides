Everyone in Kåñëa's cowherd village became terrified when Ariñöäsura approached it, but the Lord pacified them, and when the bull demon charged Him He seized him by the horns and threw him about six yards. Though weakened, Ariñöa still wanted to attack Kåñëa. Thus, dripping with sweat, he charged the Lord once again. This time Kåñëa grabbed his horns, threw him to the ground and thrashed him like a pile of wet clothing. The demon vomited blood and gave up his life. Then Kåñëa and Räma, while being honored by the demigods and cowherd boys, returned to the village."

He informed the King that Kåñëa and Balaräma were not Nanda's sons but rather Vasudeva's. It was out of fear of Kaàsa that Vasudeva had put the two boys under Nanda's care. Furthermore, said Närada, Kaàsa would meet his death at Their hands."

He called for the demons Cäëüra and Muñöika and instructed them to kill the two brothers in a wrestling match. Then he spoke to Akrüra, who was expert at executing his duties. Taking Akrüra by the hand, Kaàsa persuaded him to go to Vraja to bring the two boys to Mathurä. Akrüra agreed to carry out Kaàsa's order and then returned home."
