According to the äcäryas, Närada also advised Kaàsa that if he killed Vasudeva the two young boys might flee and that it was therefore better not to kill him. Rather, Närada recommended, Kaàsa should bring Kåñëa and Balaräma to Kaàsa's capital city, Mathurä."

In fact, as explained in the Eleventh Canto, Vasudeva was grateful to Närada because he was arranging for Kaàsa's death at Kåñëa's hands, and further arranging for Kåñëa to come and live in Mathurä, where His loving father could associate with Him."
