In one four-line verse we simultaneously learn that Lord Kåñëa killed a powerful and wicked demon and that His boyish beauty gave festive pleasure to His young girlfriends. Lord Kåñëa is as hard as a thunderbolt or as soft as a rose, depending on our attitude toward Him. The demon Ariñöa wanted to kill Kåñëa and all His friends, so the Lord beat him into a wet rag and killed him. The gopés, however, loved Kåñëa, and thus the Lord boyishly reciprocated their conjugal feelings."
