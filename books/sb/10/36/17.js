The identity of Devaké's eighth child was extremely important to Kaàsa because a prophecy had foretold that her eighth child would kill him. Here Närada informs the King that the eighth child of Devaké was the formidable Kåñëa, thus implying that the prophecy should be taken very seriously. Having received this information, Kaàsa obviously will now do everything in his power to kill Kåñëa and Balaräma."
