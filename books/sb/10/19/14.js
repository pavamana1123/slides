Therefore, rather than considering Kåñëa to be God, after they saw His extraordinary power they thought that perhaps He was a demigod. But since Lord Kåñëa was their beloved friend, they were on the same level with Him, and thus they thought that they too must be demigods. In this way Kåñëa's cowherd friends became overwhelmed with ecstasy."
