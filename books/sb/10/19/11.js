The Absolute Truth, the supreme almighty Lord, is actually a young, blissful cowherd boy named Kåñëa. God is youthful, and His mentality is playful. When He saw that His beloved friends were terrified of the forest fire, He simply told them to close their eyes and not be afraid. Then Lord Kåñëa acted, as described in the next verse."
