As Pradyumna fought with Dyumän, other Yadu heroes like Gada, Sätyaki, and Sämba began to create havoc among Çälva's army. The battle continued in this way for twenty-seven days and nights."

Suddenly Çälva noticed the Lord and threw his spear at Kåñëa's charioteer, but the Lord shattered the weapon into hundreds of pieces and pierced Çälva and his Saubha vehicle with numerous arrows. Çälva responded by shooting an arrow that struck Kåñëa's left arm. Amazingly, the Lord dropped the Çärìga bow He was holding in His left hand. The demigods watching the battle cried out in alarm upon seeing the bow fall, while Çälva took the opportunity to insult Kåñëa."

A moment later a man came before Lord Kåñëa and, after offering Him obeisances, introduced himself as a messenger from mother Devaké. The man informed the Lord that His father, Vasudeva, had been kidnapped by Çälva. Upon hearing this, Lord Kåñëa seemed to lament like an ordinary man. Çälva then led forward someone who looked just like Vasudeva, decapitated him and took the head with him into his Saubha airship. Lord Çré Kåñëa, however, could understand the magic tricks of Çälva. Thus He pierced Çälva with a shower of arrows and struck the Saubha vehicle with His club, demolishing it. Çälva descended from his airplane and rushed toward Lord Kåñëa to attack Him, but the Lord took up His Sudarçana disc and severed Çälva's head from his body."
