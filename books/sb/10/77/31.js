Actually, it is not at all possible that Lord Kåñëa was misled by the mystic jugglery of Çälva. He was displaying His pastime of playing the role of a human being.\""

            "content": "All the great Bhägavatam commentators conclude that grief, illusion, attachment and fear, which arise out of ignorance of the soul, can never be present in the transcendental dramatic pastimes enacted by the Lord. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé gives many examples from Kåñëa's pastimes to illustrate this point. For instance, when the cowherd boys entered the mouth of Aghäsura, Lord Kåñëa was apparently astonished. Similarly, when Brahmä took away Lord Kåñëa's cowherd boyfriends and calves, the Lord at first began to look for them as if He did not know where they were. Thus the Lord plays the part of an ordinary human being so as to relish transcendental pastimes with His devotees. One should never think the Personality of Godhead is an ordinary person, as Çukadeva Gosvämé explains in this and the following verse."
