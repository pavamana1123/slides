But the enthusiasm of Çälva can be compared to the speedy march of flies into a fire. Lord Kåñëa, by hurling His arrows with unfathomable strength, injured Çälva, whose armor, bow and jeweled helmet all scattered into pieces. With a crashing blow from Kåñëa's club, Çälva's wonderful airplane burst into pieces and fell into the sea.\""
