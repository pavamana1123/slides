To do this, King Yudhiñöhira performed the Räjasüya sacrifice, a very difficult task."

But King Yudhiñöhira, because of his unflinching devotion to Kåñëa, could fulfill all his desires successfully by the performance of the Räjasüya sacrifice. From the description of the Räjasüya yajïa, it appears that such a function is a great ocean of opulent desires. It is not possible for an ordinary man to cross over such an ocean; nevertheless, by the grace of Lord Kåñëa, King Yudhiñöhira was able to cross over it very easily, and thus he became freed from all anxieties.\""
