But despite all occurrences, Kåñëa was silent. He did not say anything against or in favor of the incident. It appeared that Duryodhana had been put into illusion by the supreme will of Lord Kåñëa, and this was the beginning of the enmity between the two sects of the Kuru dynasty. This appeared to be a part of Kåñëa's plan in His mission to decrease the burden of the world.\""
