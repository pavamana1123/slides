He became especially envious and lustful upon seeing the beauty of Draupadé because he had cherished a special attraction for her from the very beginning of her marriage with the Päëòavas. In the marriage selection assembly of Draupadé, Duryodhana had also been present, and with other princes he had been very much captivated by the beauty of Draupadé, but he had failed to achieve her.\""
