When the sacrifice was complete, the King adorned the priests, the exalted members of the assembly and his own relatives with fragrant sandalwood paste, flower garlands and fine clothing. Then they all went to the banks of the Ganges to perform the ritual bathing that marks the end of the sponsor's period of initiation for the sacrifice. Before the final bathing, there was much sporting in the river among the male and female participants. Sprinkled with aromatic water and other liquids, Draupadé and the other ladies appeared most beautiful, their faces shining with bashful laughter."

Then all those present who belonged to the orders of varëäçrama bathed. Yudhiñöhira put on new clothes and worshiped the learned brähmaëas, his family, friends and well-wishers, each in the particular manner suitable for them, and offered them all various gifts. The guests then departed for their homes. But King Yudhiñöhira was so anxious about his imminent separation from those who were dear to him that he compelled several of his relatives and closest friends, including Lord Kåñëa, to remain in Indraprastha a bit longer."

King Duryodhana burned with envy when he saw these riches. One day, Yudhiñöhira was seated with Lord Kåñëa in his royal assembly hall. Attended by his subordinates and family members, he was manifesting magnificence equal to that of Lord Indra. At that time Duryodhana entered the hall in a fitful mood. Bewildered by the mystic craft of Maya Dänava, Duryodhana mistook parts of the solid floor for water and thus lifted his garment, while in one place he fell into the water, mistaking it for the solid floor. When Bhémasena, the ladies of the court and the royal princes present saw this, they began to laugh. Although Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira tried to stop them, Lord Kåñëa encouraged their laughter. Thoroughly embarrassed, Duryodhana left the assembly hall in a fury and immediately departed for Hastinäpura."
