Therefore Lord Kåñëa should immediately accept the invitation to participate in the sacrifice, but then He should arrange to kill Jaräsandha as a necessary prerequisite. In this way the kings' request for protection would be fulfilled automatically. If the Lord would thus adhere to a single policy—namely, seeing that the Räjasüya sacrifice was performed properly—all purposes would be fulfilled."

Thus the Lord could certainly have solved the dilemma of how to simultaneously satisfy King Yudhiñöhira's desire to perform the Räjasüya sacrifice and the imprisoned kings' desire for freedom. But Kåñëa wanted to give His dear devotee Uddhava the credit for the solution, and thus He pretended to be perplexed."
