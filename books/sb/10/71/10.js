The great commentator Çrédhara Svämé further explains that the term päka indicates that the kings will be saved as a result of their piety, and that the term vipäkena indicates that Jaräsandha will die as a result of his wickedness. In either case, the plan Uddhava has proposed is most favorable for the execution of the great Räjasüya sacrifice, desired by both the Lord and His pure devotees the Päëòavas, headed by King Yudhiñöhira."
