During the forest fire, Kåñëa saved the demon Mayäsura, who was hiding in the forest. Upon being saved, Mayäsura felt obliged to the Päëòavas and Lord Kåñëa, and he constructed a wonderful assembly house within the city of Hastinäpura. In this way, Lord Kåñëa, in order to please King Yudhiñöhira, remained in the city of Hastinäpura for several months. During His stay, He enjoyed strolling here and there. He used to drive on chariots along with Arjuna, and many warriors and soldiers used to follow them.\""
