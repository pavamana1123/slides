At the same time, the members of the royal assembly strongly desired that He defeat Jaräsandha and rescue the kings he was holding prisoner. The great-minded Uddhava could understand that Lord Kåñëa desired to do both things, and thus he intelligently advised how both these purposes could be simultaneously accomplished."
