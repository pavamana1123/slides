The Supreme Lord, through His invisible potency of time, creates and annihilates the entire cosmic situation, whereas great demigods such as Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva are merely the instruments of the Lord's will. Therefore Bhéma will have no difficulty acting as the Lord's instrument to kill the powerful Jaräsandha. In this way, by the Lord's arrangement, His devotee Bhéma will be glorified."
