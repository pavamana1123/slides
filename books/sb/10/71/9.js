So also do the sages who have obtained Your shelter glorify You, as do we ourselves.",

These godly women would thus sing the glories of the Lord at home, and when their children would cry for their fathers, their mothers would tell them, \"Child, do not cry. Çré Kåñëa will save your father.\" In fact, the Lord has saved many devotees in the past, as described here."
