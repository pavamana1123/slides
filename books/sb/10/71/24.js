            "content": "Lord Kåñëa is here described as Håñékeça, the Lord of the senses, and King Yudhiñöhira's rushing to the Lord is compared to the senses eagerly joining the consciousness of life. Without consciousness, the senses are useless; indeed, the senses function through consciousness. Similarly, when the individual souls are bereft of Kåñëa consciousness, love of God, they enter into a useless and illusory struggle called material existence. Pure devotees like King Yudhiñöhira are never bereft of the Lord's association, for they keep Him always within their heart, and yet they feel special ecstasy when they see the Lord after long separation, as described here."
