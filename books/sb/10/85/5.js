            "content": "When creating the material universe, the Lord expands Himself as the Paramätmä, or Supersoul, and accepts the creation as His universal body. No material body has any reason for existing without some jéva soul desiring it for his enjoyment, and no jéva can independently maintain a body without the Paramätmä accompanying him there for guidance. The Vaiñëava äcäryas, in their commentaries on the Second Canto of Çrémad Bhägavatam, explain that even before Brahmä is born from the lotus navel of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, he first accepts the whole material energy, the mahat-tattva, as his body. Thus Brahmä is the jéva embodied by the universe, and Viñëu is the Paramätmä who joins him. Brahmä must organize the specific manifestations of creation, but he cannot begin to do so until Lord Viñëu expands Himself again into the subtle energy of action—which is the sütra-tattva, or original vital air—and also into the creative energy of consciousness, buddhi-tattva."
