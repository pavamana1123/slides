    "translation": "At that time, O best of the Kurus, the universally worshiped Devaké took the opportunity to address her two sons, Kåñëa and Balaräma. Previously she had heard with astonishment that They had brought Their spiritual master's son back from death. Now, thinking of her own sons who had been murdered by Kaàsa, she felt great sorrow, and thus with tear-filled eyes she beseeched Kåñëa and Balaräma.",

            "content": "Vasudeva's love for Kåñëa had been disturbed because his awareness of Kåñëa's opulences conflicted with seeing Him as his son. In a different way, Devaké's love was somewhat distracted by her lamentation for her dead sons. So Kåñëa arranged to relieve her of the mistaken idea that anyone else but Him was actually her son. Since Devaké is known to be worshiped by all great souls, her show of maternal affection must actually have been an effect of the Lord's Yogamäyä, who increases the pleasure of His pastimes. Thus in Text 54 Devaké will be described as mohitä mäyayä viñëoù, \"bewildered by the internal energy of Lord Viñëu.\""
