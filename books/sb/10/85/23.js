Vasudeva had been reminded of his sons' greatness by hearing the sages gathered at Kurukñetra. But his sense of awe was ruining his intimate parental relationship with Kåñëa, and therefore Kåñëa wanted to dispel it."

            "content": "We should not misunderstand the \"oneness\" Lord Kåñëa speaks of here. The subtle words of the Upaniñads often mislead impersonalists into believing that all existence is ineffably one, without any variety in the ultimate issue. Some Upaniñadic mantras emphasize the sameness of God and His creation, while others speak about their difference. Tat tvam asi çvetaketo (\"You are that, O Çvetaketu\"), for example, is an abheda-väkya, a mantra affirming that all things are one with God, being His dependent expansions. But the Upaniñads also contain many bheda-väkyas, statements that affirm the unique, distinguishing qualities of the Supreme, such as this statement: ka evänyät kaù präëyäd yady eña äkäça änando na syät, eña evänandayati. \"Who would there be to activate the creation and give life to all beings if this infinite Supreme were not the original enjoyer? Indeed, He alone is the source of all pleasure.\" (Taittiréya Upaniñad. 2.7.1) By the influence of the Supreme Lord's bewildering Mäyä, envious impersonalists read the abheda-väkyas literally and accept the bheda-väkyas only in a figurative way. Authoritative Vaiñëava commentators, on the other hand, carefully reconcile the apparent contradictions in accordance with the interpretive principles of Vedic Mémäàsä and the logically established conclusions of Vedänta."
