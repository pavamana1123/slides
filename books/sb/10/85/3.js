Thus, of these two principles, the pradhäna is the predominated energy, female, incapable of independent action, while the puruña is the absolutely independent, primeval creator and enjoyer. Neither Kåñëa nor His brother Balaräma belong to the category of subordinate energy; rather, both of Them together are the original puruña, who is always joined by His manifold potencies of pleasure, knowledge and creative emanation."
