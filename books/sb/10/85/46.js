Reflecting on the possibility that his request for immediate deliverance may have been too bold, Bali Mahäräja considers that first he will need to become sufficiently purified. In any case, he thinks, Lord Kåñëa and Lord Balaräma must have come to him for some specific purpose; if he can receive the Lords' order and carry it out, that will be his best opportunity for purification. Indeed, as Bali states, a devotee acting under the Personality of Godhead's instruction need no longer follow the sacrificial injunctions and prohibitions of the Vedas."
