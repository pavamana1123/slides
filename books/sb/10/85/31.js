Mahä-Viñëu, the first creator, is Lord Näräyaëa's expansion. The total material energy emanates from Mahä-Viñëu's glance, and of that total material energy the three modes of nature are divided portions. Thus it is Çré Kåñëa, acting through His expansions, who generates, sustains and dissolves the universe."
