After glorifying his sons, Vasudeva fell at Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet and begged Him to drive away the conception that the Lord was his son. Instead, Lord Kåñëa restored that conception by instructing Vasudeva in the science of Godhead, and upon hearing these instructions, Vasudeva became peaceful and free of doubt."

She said, \"Please fulfill my desire in the same way. Please bring back my sons who were killed by Kaàsa so I may see them once again.\" Entreated in this way by Their mother, the two Lords went to the subterranean planet of Sutala, where They approached Bali Mahäräja. King Bali greeted Them respectfully, offering Them seats of honor, worshiping Them and reciting prayers. Kåñëa and Balaräma then requested Bali to return Devaké's dead sons. The Lords received the boys from Bali and returned them to Devaké who felt such a surge of affection for them that milk began spontaneously flowing from her breasts. Overjoyed, Devaké fed the children her breastmilk, and by drinking the remnants of milk once drunk by Lord Kåñëa Himself, they regained their original forms as demigods and went back to heaven."
