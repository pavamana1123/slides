    "translation": "Whatever potencies the life air and other elements of universal creation exhibit are actually all personal energies of the Supreme Lord, for both life and matter are subordinate to Him and dependent on Him, and also different from one another. Thus everything active in the material world is set into motion by the Supreme Lord.",

And because präëa is so subtle—finer than the tangible manifestations of creation—it is sometimes considered the ultimate source of everything. But even subtle energies such as präëa depend for their functional capacity on the supremely subtle Paramätmä. That is the idea Vasudeva expresses here by the word päratantryät, \"because of dependence.\" Just as the velocity of an arrow is derived from the strength of the bowman who shoots it, so all subordinate energies depend on the power of the Supreme Lord."
