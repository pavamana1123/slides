Although at the time of His birth in Kaàsa's prison Lord Kåñëa told Vasudeva and Devaké that His mission was to rid the earth of unwanted kñatriyas, still His two parents could not avoid thinking of Him as their helpless son who needed protection from King Kaàsa. In reality, of course, both Vasudeva and Devaké were participating in the divine pastime of the Lord's birth under the perfect direction of His internal energy; only out of transcendental humility does Vasudeva criticize himself in this way."
