    "translation": "By drinking her nectarean milk, the remnants of what Kåñëa Himself had previously drunk, the six sons touched the transcendental body of the Lord, Näräyaëa, and this contact awakened them to their original identities. They bowed down to Govinda, Devaké, their father and Balaräma, and then, as everyone looked on, they left for the abode of the demigods.",

            "content": "Lord Kåñëa remained as an infant with Devaké and Vasudeva for only a very short time. First the Lord appeared before them in His four-armed Viñëu form, and after hearing their prayers He changed Himself into an apparently ordinary infant for their pleasure. But to save Kåñëa from suffering His brothers' fate, Vasudeva at once removed Him from Kaàsa's prison. Just before Vasudeva took Him away, mother Devaké suckled Kåñëa once so that He would not feel thirsty during the long trip to Nanda-vraja. This we learn from the commentary of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura."
