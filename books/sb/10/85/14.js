Then, since He maintains no association with them during the period of universal dissolution, they in fact no longer exist. In other words, material manifestations have real, functioning existence only when the Lord turns His attention to the creation and maintenance of the material cosmos. The Lord is never \"within\" these objects in any material sense, but He does mercifully pervade them all as the impersonal Brahman, and as the Paramätmä He enters within every atom and also accompanies the jéva souls in their individual embodiments. As the Lord describes in His own words in the verses of Bhagavad-gétä :"
