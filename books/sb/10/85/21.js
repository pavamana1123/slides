Therefore he shouldn't be absorbed in thinking of My godly aspects. Moreover, his reverence greatly embarrasses Me. It was to avoid this very situation that, after killing Kaàsa, I made a special effort to reinforce their pure parental love for Me and Balaräma. But now, unfortunately, the statements of these sages threaten to revive some of Vasudeva's and Devaké's previous awareness of My majesty.\""
