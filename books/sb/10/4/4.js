    "translation": "Devaké helplessly, piteously appealed to Kaàsa: My dear brother, all good fortune unto you. Don't kill this girl. She will be your daughter-in-law. Indeed, it is unworthy of you to kill a woman.",

But now, by the influence of mäyä, he was prepared to kill a woman—not only a woman, but a small, helpless newborn child. Devaké wanted to save her brother from this terrible, sinful act. Therefore she told him, \"Don't be so atrocious as to kill a female child. Let there be all good fortune for you.\" Demons can do anything for their personal benefit, not considering what is pious or vicious. But Devaké, on the contrary, although safe because she had already given birth to her own son, Kåñëa, was anxious to save the daughter of someone else. This was natural for her."
