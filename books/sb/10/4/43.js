Instead of taking good instructions from the sages and the çästras, godless nondevotees act whimsically, according to their own plans.

Therefore one must change one's own decision and follow the decision of Kåñëa and Kåñëa's devotees. Then one is rescued from punishment by Yamaräja. Kaàsa was not uneducated. It appears from his talks with Vasudeva and Devaké that he knew all about the laws of nature. But because of his association with bad ministers, he could not make a clear decision about his welfare. Therefore the Caitanya-caritämåta  says:"
