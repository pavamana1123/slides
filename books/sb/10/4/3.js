Käla is actually another name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead when He appears only for the purpose of killing. When Arjuna inquired from Kåñëa in His universal form, \"Who are You?\" the Lord presented Himself as käla, death personified to kill. By nature's law, when there is an unwanted increase in population, käla appears, and by some arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, people are killed wholesale in different ways, by war, pestilence, famine and so on. At that time, even atheistic political leaders go to a church, mosque or temple for protection by God or gods and submissively say, \"God willing.\" Before that, they pay no attention to God, not caring to know God or His will, but when käla appears, they say, \"God willing.\" Death is but another feature of the supreme käla, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the time of death, the atheist must submit to this supreme käla, and then the Supreme Personality of Godhead takes away all his possessions (måtyuù sarva-haraç cäham  without Kåñëa consciousness, one is condemned to continue wandering in birth and death, not knowing what will happen in one's next birth."
