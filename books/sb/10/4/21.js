We may superficially see that one is suffering or enjoying because of some external causes, but the real cause is one's own fruitive activities. Even when someone kills someone else, it is to be understood that the person who was killed met the fruitive results of his own work and that the man who killed him acted as the agent of material nature. Thus Kaàsa begged Devaké's pardon by analyzing the matter deeply. He was not the cause of the death of Devaké's sons. Rather, this was their own destiny. Under the circumstances, Devaké should excuse Kaàsa and forget his past deeds without lamentation. Kaàsa admitted his own fault, but whatever he had done was under the control of providence. Kaàsa might have been the immediate cause for the death of Devaké's sons, but the remote cause was their past deeds. This was an actual fact."
