This was one cause of his astonishment. Also, how is it that the eighth child of Devaké was a female? This also astonished him. Asuras are generally devotees of mother Durgä, Çakti, or of demigods, especially Lord Çiva. The appearance of Durgä in her original eight-armed feature, holding various weapons, immediately changed Kaàsa's mind about Devaké's being an ordinary human. Devaké must have had some transcendental qualities; otherwise why would the goddess Durgä have taken birth from her womb? Under the circumstances, Kaàsa, struck with wonder, wanted to compensate for his atrocities against his sister Devaké."
