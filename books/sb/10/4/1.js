Before the awakening of the watchmen and the others in the prison house, many other things happened. Kåñëa was born and transferred to the home of Yaçodä in Gokula, the strong doors opened and again closed, and Vasudeva resumed his former condition of being shackled. The watchmen, however, could not understand all this. They awakened only when they heard the crying of the newborn child, Yogamäyä."

If one dog barks, many other dogs immediately follow it by barking. Although the street dogs are not appointed by anyone to act as watchmen, they think they are responsible for protecting the neighborhood, and as soon as someone unknown enters it, they all begin to bark. Both Yogamäyä and Mahämäyä act in all material activities (prakåteù kriyamäëäni guëaiù karmäëi sarvaçaù ), doglike watchmen such as politicians and diplomats think that they are protecting their neighborhoods from the dangers of the outside world. These are the actions of mäyä. But one who surrenders to Kåñëa is relieved of the protection afforded by the dogs and doglike guardians of this material world."
