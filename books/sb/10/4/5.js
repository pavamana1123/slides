Then she wanted to compromise with him by saying that whatever he had done was not his fault, but was ordained by destiny. Then she appealed to him to give her the daughter as a gift. Devaké was the daughter of a kñatriya and knew how to play the political game. In politics there are different methods of achieving success: first repression (dama), then compromise (säma), and then asking for a gift (däna). Devaké first adopted the policy of repression by directly attacking Kaàsa for having cruelly, atrociously killed her babies. Then she compromised by saying that this was not his fault, and then she begged for a gift. As we learn from the history of the Mahäbhärata, or \"Greater India,\" the wives and daughters of the ruling class, the kñatriyas, knew the political game, but we never find that a woman was given the post of chief executive. This is in accordance with the injunctions of Manu-saàhitä, but unfortunately Manu-saàhitä is now being insulted, and the Äryans, the members of Vedic society, cannot do anything. Such is the nature of Kali-yuga."

There was no need to give good instructions to Kaàsa. Upadeço hi murkhäëäà prakopäya na çäntaye (Cäëakya Paëòita). If a foolish person is given good instructions, he becomes more and more angry. Moreover, a cruel person is more dangerous than a snake. A snake and a cruel person are both cruel, but a cruel person is more dangerous because although a snake can be charmed by mantras or subdued by herbs, a cruel person cannot be subdued by any means. Such was the nature of Kaàsa."
