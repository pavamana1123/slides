Upon hearing this news, Kaàsa appeared with great force in the maternity room, and in spite of Devaké's pleas that the child be saved, the demon forcibly snatched the child from Devaké's hands and dashed the child against a rock. Unfortunately for Kaàsa, however, the newborn child slipped away from his hands, rose above his head and appeared as the eight-armed form of Durgä. Durgä then told Kaàsa, \"The enemy you contemplate has taken birth somewhere else. Therefore your plan to persecute all the children will prove futile.\""

He decided to release Devaké and Vasudeva, and he admitted before them the wrongness of his atrocities. Falling at the feet of Devaké and Vasudeva, he begged their pardon and tried to convince them that because the events that had taken place were destined to happen, they should not be unhappy for his having killed so many of their children. Devaké and Vasudeva, being naturally very pious, immediately excused Kaàsa for his atrocities, and Kaàsa, after seeing that his sister and brother-in-law were happy, returned to his home."

            "content": "After the night passed, however, Kaàsa called for his ministers and informed them of all that had happened. The ministers, who were all demons, advised Kaàsa that because his enemy had already taken birth somewhere else, all the children born within the past ten days in the villages within Kaàsa's kingdom should be killed. Although the demigods always feared Kaàsa, they should not be treated leniently; since they were enemies, Kaàsa should try his best to uproot their existence. The demoniac ministers further advised that Kaàsa and the demons continue their enmity toward Viñëu because Viñëu is the original person among all the demigods. The brähmaëas, the cows, the Vedas, austerity, truthfulness, control of the senses and mind, faithfulness and mercy are among the different parts of the body of Viñëu, who is the origin of all the demigods, including Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva. Therefore, the ministers advised, the demigods, the saintly persons, the cows and the brähmaëas should be systematically persecuted. Strongly advised in this way by his friends, the demoniac ministers, Kaàsa approved of their instructions and considered it beneficial to be envious of the brähmaëas. Following Kaàsa's orders, therefore, the demons began committing their atrocities all over Vrajabhümi."
