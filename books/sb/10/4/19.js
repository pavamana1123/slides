    "translation": "In this world, we can see that pots, dolls and other products of the earth appear, break and then disappear, mixing with the earth. Similarly, the bodies of all conditioned living entities are annihilated, but the living entities, like the earth itself, are unchanging and never annihilated [na hanyate hanyamäne çarére (<a href=\"/wiki/BG_2.20_(1972)\" title=\"BG 2.20 (1972)\">BG 2.20</a>)].",

Five thousand years ago, there were kings like Kaàsa, who is described as an asura, but he was better than modern politicians and diplomats, who have no knowledge about ätma-tattva. As stated in the Vedas, asaìgo hy ayaà puruñaù: the spirit soul has no connection with the changes of the material body. The body undergoes six changes—birth, growth, sustenance, by-products, dwindling and then annihilation—but the soul undergoes no such changes. Even after the annihilation of a particular bodily form, the original source of the bodily elements does not change. The living entity enjoys the material body, which appears and disappears, but the five elements earth, water, fire, air and ether remain the same. The example given here is that pots and dolls are produced from the earth, and when broken or destroyed they mingle with their original ingredients. In any case, the source of supply remains the same."

The ätmä does not undergo birth, death or changes like the body. Therefore a Vedic aphorism says, asaìgo hy ayaà puruñaù: although the soul is conditioned within this material world, he has no connections with the changes of the material body."
