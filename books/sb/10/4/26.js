    "translation": "O great personality Kaàsa, only by the influence of ignorance does one accept the material body and bodily ego. What you have said about this philosophy is correct. Persons in the bodily concept of life, lacking self-realization, differentiate in terms of \"This is mine\" and \"This belongs to another.\"",

There is no question of doing anything independently, for one who has put himself in this material atmosphere is fully under the control of nature's laws. Our main business, therefore, should be to get out of this conditioned life and again become situated in spiritual existence. Only due to ignorance does a person think, \"I am a demigod,\" \"I am a human being,\" \"I am a dog,\" \"I am a cat,\" or, when the ignorance is still further advanced, \"I am God.\" Unless one is fully self-realized, one's life of ignorance will continue."
