Thus in different places she is known by different names. Her devotees are known as çäktas, or worshipers of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas worshipers of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself are called Vaiñëavas. Vaiñëavas are destined to return home, back to Godhead, in the spiritual world, whereas the çäktas are destined to live within this material world to enjoy different types of material happiness. In the material world, the living entity must accept different types of bodies. Bhrämayan sarva-bhütäni yanträrüòhäni mäyayä ). The words janma na eti indicate that these living entities remain in their original, spiritual bodies to enjoy the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the transcendental abodes Vaikuëöha and Våndävana."
