According to the prophecy, Kaàsa would be killed by the eighth child of Devaké. Therefore, Vasudeva and Devaké saw that behind all these incidents was a great plan devised by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because the Lord had already taken birth, just like a human child, and was in the safe custody of Yaçodä, everything was happening according to plan, and there was no need to continue their ill feeling toward Kaàsa. Thus they accepted Kaàsa's words."
