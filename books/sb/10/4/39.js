These principles establish the kingdom of Viñëu. Without the kingdom of Viñëu, the kingdom of God, no one can be happy. Na te viduù svärtha-gatià hi viñëum:  in this demoniac civilization, people unfortunately do not understand that the self-interest of human society lies in Viñëu. Duräçayä ye bahir-artha-mäninaù: thus they are involved in a hopeless hope. People want to be happy without God consciousness, or Kåñëa consciousness, because they are led by blind leaders who lead human society to chaos. The asuric adherents of Kaàsa wanted to disrupt the traditional condition of human happiness and thus defeat the devatäs, the devotees and demigods. Unless the devotees and demigods predominate, the asuras will increase, and human society will be in a chaotic condition."
