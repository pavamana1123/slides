Because Devaké bore Durgädevé in her womb, Kaàsa praised both Devaké and her husband. Asuras are very devoted to the goddess Durgä, Kälé and so forth. Kaàsa, therefore, truly astonished, appreciated the exalted position of his sister and brother-in-law. Durgä is certainly not under the laws of nature, because she herself is the controller of the laws of nature. Ordinary living beings, however, are controlled by these laws (prakåteù kriyamäëäni guëaiù karmäëi sarvaçaù ). Consequently, none of us are allowed to live together for any long period. By speaking in this way, Kaàsa tried to pacify his sister and brother-in-law."
