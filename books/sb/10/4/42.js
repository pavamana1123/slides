    "translation": "Lord Viñëu, the Supersoul within the core of everyone's heart, is the ultimate enemy of the asuras and is therefore known as asura-dviö. He is the leader of all the demigods because all the demigods, including Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä, exist under His protection. The great saintly persons, sages and Vaiñëavas also depend upon Him. To persecute the Vaiñëavas, therefore, is the only way to kill Viñëu.",

The demoniac followers of Kaàsa thought that if the Vaiñëavas, saintly persons and sages were persecuted, the original body of Viñëu would naturally be destroyed. Thus they decided to suppress Vaiñëavism. The asuras perpetually struggle to persecute the Vaiñëavas because they do not want Vaiñëavism to spread. Vaiñëavas preach only devotional service, not encouraging karmés, jïänés and yogés, because if one must liberate oneself from material, conditional life, one must ultimately become a Vaiñëava. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is directed with this understanding, and therefore the asuras always try to suppress it."
