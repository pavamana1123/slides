The energy of Yogamäyä and Mahämäyä keeps the living entities sleeping in this material world in the great darkness of ignorance. Yogamäyä, the goddess Durgä, kept Kaàsa in darkness about Kåñëa's birth and misled him to believe that his enemy Kåñëa had been born elsewhere. Kåñëa was born the son of Devaké, but according to the Lord's original plan, as prophesied to Brahmä, He went to Våndävana to give pleasure to mother Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja and other intimate friends and devotees for eleven years. Then He would return to kill Kaàsa. Because Kaàsa did not know this, he believed Yogamäyä's statement that Kåñëa was born elsewhere, not of Devaké."
