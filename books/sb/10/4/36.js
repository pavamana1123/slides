    "translation": "The demigods boast uselessly while away from the battlefield. Only where there is no fighting can they show their prowess. Therefore, from such demigods we have nothing to fear. As for Lord Viñëu, He is in seclusion in the core of the hearts of the yogés. As for Lord Çiva, he has gone to the forest. And as for Lord Brahmä, he is always engaged in austerities and meditation. The other demigods, headed by Indra, are devoid of prowess. Therefore you have nothing to fear.",
