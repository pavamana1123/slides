A master may be incompetent, but a controller is a master or lord who in fact makes things happen. The parameçvara, the supreme éçvara, the supreme controller, is of course God, Kåñëa, the cause of all causes."

The modern, impersonal concept of the universe depicts an almost totally lifeless cosmos in which the earth floats meaninglessly. Thus we are left with the dubious \"ultimate purpose\" of preserving and reproducing our genetic code, which has its own \"ultimate purpose\" of adding another link to the meaningless chain of events by again reproducing itself."

The essence of reality is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His personal relationship with the innumerable living beings, of whom we are samples. Some of the living beings are trapped in the illusion of materialism, or identification with the material body, while others are liberated, aware of their eternal, spiritual nature. A third class comprises those progressing in self-realization from the materialistic state of ignorance to the enlightened state of Kåñëa consciousness."

            "content": "Reality is ultimately personal and divine, and therefore it is not surprising that, as the Vedic literature reveals to us, our universe and other universes are managed by great personalities, just as our city, state and country are managed by empowered personalities. When we democratically award a particular politician the right to govern, we vote for him because he has exhibited something we call \"leadership\" or \"ability.\" We think, \"He'll get the job done.\" In other words, it is only after an individual acquires the power to govern that we vote for him; our vote does not make him a leader but rather recognizes a power in him coming from some other source. Thus, as Lord Kåñëa explains at the end of the Tenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä, any living being exhibiting an extraordinary power, ability or authority must have been empowered by the Lord Himself or by the Lord's energy."

Of course, they do reflect His will indirectly, since it is by Kåñëa's arrangement that the laws of nature act upon ignorant living beings, gradually persuading them, through their journey of many lifetimes, to surrender to the Supreme Lord. Thus as politicians create wars, false hopes and innumerable passionate schemes for the materialistic persons who follow them, the politicians are indirectly carrying out the Lord's program of allowing the conditioned souls to experience the bitter fruit of godlessness."

As Lord Kåñëa states in the Bhagavad-gétä , \"If I did not execute standard duties, the whole world would be misled and in fact destroyed.\" Thus the Lord showed, in His different incarnations, how to act properly in this world. A good example is Lord Rämacandra, who behaved wonderfully as the son of King Daçaratha."

This foremost of all religious principles—that the Lord is unique, without equal or superior—was clearly demonstrated in Lord Kåñëa's apparently immoral pastimes with the gopés. No one can imitate these activities without incurring dire consequences, as explained here by Çukadeva Gosvämé. One who thinks that Lord Kåñëa is an ordinary living being subjected to lust, or who accepts His räsa dance as admirable and tries to imitate it, will certainly be vanquished, as described in Text 30 of this chapter."

But the Lord is eternally free from any entanglement in the laws of karma. He is on a unique platform."
