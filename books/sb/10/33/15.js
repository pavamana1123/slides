    "translation": "Enhancing the beauty of the gopés' faces were the lotus flowers behind their ears, the locks of hair decorating their cheeks, and drops of perspiration. The reverberation of their armlets and ankle bells made a loud musical sound, and their chaplets scattered. Thus the gopés danced with the Supreme Lord in the arena of the räsa dance as swarms of bees sang in accompaniment.",
