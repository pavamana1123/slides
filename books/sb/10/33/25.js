    "translation": "Although the gopés were firmly attached to Lord Kåñëa, whose desires are always fulfilled, the Lord was not internally affected by any mundane sex desire. Still, to perform His pastimes the Lord took advantage of all those moonlit autumn nights, which inspire poetic descriptions of transcendental affairs.",

            "content": "It is difficult to translate into English the word rasa, which indicates the spiritual bliss derived from one's loving relationship with Lord Kåñëa. That bliss is experienced in the midst of spiritual pastimes with the Lord and His devotees. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains that great Vaiñëava poets like Vyäsa, Paräçara, Jayadeva, Léläçuka (Bilvamaìgala Öhäkura), Govardhanäcärya and Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé have tried in their poetry to describe the conjugal affairs of the Lord. These descriptions are never complete, however, since the Lord's pastimes are unlimited; thus the attempt to glorify such pastimes is still going on and will go on forever. Lord Kåñëa arranged an extraordinary season of beautiful autumn nights to enhance His loving affairs, and those autumn nights have inspired transcendental poets since time immemorial."
