The demigods and their wives were overwhelmed with eagerness to witness the räsa dance, and they soon crowded the sky with their hundreds of celestial airplanes.",

Each gopé saw one manifestation of Kåñëa. The demigods and their wives, however, could see all His different manifestations as they watched the räsa dance from their airplanes, and thus they were completely astonished."
