    "translation": "In this way Lord Kåñëa, the original Lord Näräyaëa, master of the goddess of fortune, took pleasure in the company of the young women of Vraja by embracing them, caressing them and glancing lovingly at them as He smiled His broad, playful smiles. It was just as if a child were playing with his own reflection.",

All these potencies, taking personal forms, engage Lord Kåñëa in His pastimes. Just as the opulent manifestation of His one supreme transcendental potency manifests all the countless potencies of the Lord, so in the räsa dance Kåñëa manifests Himself as many times as there are various potencies represented by the gopés. Everything is Kåñëa, but by His desire His spiritual energy Yogamäyä manifests the gopés. When His internal potency Yogamäyä thus produces such pastimes for the enhancement of His transcendental emotions, it is just like a young boy playing with His own reflection. But since these pastimes are created by His spiritual potency, they are eternal and self-manifesting.\""
