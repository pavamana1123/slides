    "translation": "As the gopés sang in praise of Kåñëa, their feet danced, their hands gestured, and their eyebrows moved with playful smiles. With their braids and belts tied tight, their waists bending, their faces perspiring, the garments on their breasts moving this way and that, and their earrings swinging on their cheeks, Lord Kåñëa's young consorts shone like streaks of lightning in a mass of clouds.",

The word ägranthayaù may also be read agranthayaù, meaning \"loosened.\" This would indicate that although the gopés began the dance with their hair and belts tightly drawn, these gradually slackened and loosened."

Thus sometimes Kåñëa and the gopés would artistically move their interlocked arms together, and sometimes they would separate arms and exhibit mudräs to act out the meaning of the songs they were singing."
