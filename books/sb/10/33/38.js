And such also is the duration of his night.\" Thus one thousand ages entered within a single twelve-hour night when Lord Kåñëa performed His räsa dance. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté compares this inconceivable impression of time to the fact that many universes fit neatly within the forty-mile range of earthly Våndävana. Or one may consider that mother Yaçodä could not encircle the small abdomen of child Kåñëa with numerous ropes, and that at another time He manifested many universes within His mouth. The transcendence of spiritual reality above and beyond mundane physics is concisely explained in Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé's Laghu-bhagavatämåta:"

When the word väsudeva is understood in this context, the word väsudevänumoditäù indicates that the presiding Deity of consciousness, Väsudeva, manifested embarrassment and fear of their elders within the gopés' hearts, and therefore it was only with great reluctance that the young girls returned home."
