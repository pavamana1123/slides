    "translation": "One who is not a great controller should never imitate the behavior of ruling personalities, even mentally. If out of foolishness an ordinary person does imitate such behavior, he will simply destroy himself, just as a person who is not Rudra would destroy himself if he tried to drink an ocean of poison.",

But if we were to drink even a drop of such poison, we would die immediately. Just as we should not imitate this pastime of Çiva's, we should not imitate Lord Kåñëa's activities with the gopés. We should clearly understand that while Lord Kåñëa certainly descends to demonstrate religious principles, He also descends to demonstrate that He is God and we are not. That also must be demonstrated. The Lord enjoys with His internal potency and thus attracts us to the spiritual platform. We should not try to imitate Kåñëa, for we will suffer severely."
