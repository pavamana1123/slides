    "translation": "Lord Kåñëa's garland had been crushed during His conjugal dalliance with the gopés and colored vermilion by the kuìkuma powder on their breasts. To dispel the fatigue of the gopés, Kåñëa entered the water of the Yamunä, followed swiftly by bees who were singing like the best of the Gandharvas. He appeared like a lordly elephant entering the water to relax in the company of his consorts. Indeed, the Lord had transgressed all worldly and Vedic morality just as a powerful elephant might break the dikes in a paddy field.",
