A fire devours all that is fed into it but the fire does not change its nature. Similarly, a great personality does not fall from his position by an irregularity in behavior. In the following verse, however, Çukadeva Gosvämé makes it clear that if we try to imitate the great personalities ruling the universe, the result will be catastrophic."
