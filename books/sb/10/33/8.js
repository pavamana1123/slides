Among these rägas are sixteen thousand principal ones, which were manifested by the gopés.\" Thus the gopés created sixteen thousand different rägas, or musical modes, and these have subsequently been disseminated throughout the world. The words yad-gétenedam ävåtam also indicate that even today devotees throughout the world sing the praises of Kåñëa, following the example of the gopés."
