Thus these men never actually had any intimate contact with the divine ladies of Vraja.\" The gopés are the internal energy of the Lord and can never belong to any other living being. Kåñëa arranged their apparent marriage to other men simply to create the excitement of parakéya-rasa, the love between a married woman and her paramour. These activities are absolutely pure because they are the Lord's pastimes, and saintly persons since time immemorial have relished these supreme spiritual events."
