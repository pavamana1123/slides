Nahuña became puffed up when he temporarily assumed the post of Indra. When out of pride Nahuña ordered some brähmaëas to carry him in a palanquin to an illicit meeting with Lord Indra's chaste wife, Çacé, the brähmaëas made him fall down from his position and become an old man. King Vena was similarly mad, and when he insulted the brähmaëas they killed him by loud incantations of the syllable hum. Rävaëa was a famous ruler of the Räkñasas, but out of lust he kidnapped mother Sétä, and thus her husband, Lord Rämacandra, killed him. Naraka was a ruler of the Daityas who dared to steal mother Aditi's earrings, and for his offense he was also killed. Thus throughout history powerful leaders have fallen from their positions because they became intoxicated with their so-called opulence."
