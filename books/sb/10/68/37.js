    "translation": "\"The dust of Kåñëa's lotus feet, which is the source of holiness for all places of pilgrimage, is worshiped by all the great demigods. The principal deities of all planets are engaged in His service, and they consider themselves most fortunate to take the dust of the lotus feet of Kåñëa on their crowns. Great demigods like Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, and even the goddess of fortune and I, are simply parts of His spiritual identity, and we also carefully carry that dust on our heads. And still Kåñëa is not fit to use the royal insignia or even sit on the royal throne?",

According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the place of pilgrimage especially referred to here is the Ganges River. The Ganges water is inundating the whole world, and since it is emanating from Kåñëa's lotus feet, its banks have turned into great places of pilgrimage."
