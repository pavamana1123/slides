He stood up steadily and, taking His plow in His hand, began striking the earth with it. In this way the whole city of Hastinäpura was separated from the earth. Lord Balaräma then began to drag the city toward the flowing water of the river Ganges. Because of this, there was a great tremor throughout Hastinäpura, as if there had been an earthquake, and it seemed that the whole city would be dismantled.\""
