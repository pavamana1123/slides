She was a very highly qualified girl of the Kuru dynasty, and many princes wanted to marry her. In such cases the svayaà-vara ceremony is held so that the girl may select her husband according to her own choice. In Lakñmaëä's svayaà-vara assembly, when the girl was to select her husband, Sämba appeared. He was the son of Kåñëa by Jämbavaté, one of the chief wives of Lord Kåñëa. This son Sämba is so named because, being a very bad child, he always lived close to his mother. The name Sämba indicates that this son was very much his mother's pet. Ambä means \"mother,\" and sa means \"with.\" So this special name was given to him because he always remained with his mother. He was also known as Jämbavaté-suta for the same reason. As previously explained, all the sons of Kåñëa were as qualified as their great father, Lord Kåñëa. Sämba wanted the daughter of Duryodhana, Lakñmaëä, although she was not inclined to have him. Therefore Sämba kidnapped Lakñmaëä by force from the svayaà-vara ceremony.\""
