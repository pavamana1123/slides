When Sämba forcibly took away Lakñmaëa, the elderly members of the Kuru dynasty were pleased to see that he was actually the suitable match for her. In order to see his personal strength, however, they fought with him, and without any respect for the regulations of fighting, they all arrested him. When the Yadu dynasty decided to release Sämba from the confinement of the Kurus, Lord Balaräma came personally to settle the matter, and as a powerful kñatriya He ordered them to free Sämba immediately. The Kauravas became superficially insulted by this order, so they challenged Lord Balaräma's power. They simply wanted to see Him exhibit His inconceivable strength. Thus with great pleasure they handed over their daughter to Sämba, and the whole matter was settled. Duryodhana, being affectionate toward his daughter Lakñmaëä, had her married to Sämba in great pomp.... Balaräma was very satisfied after His great reception from the side of the Kurus, and accompanied by the newly married couple, He started toward His capital city of Dvärakä."
