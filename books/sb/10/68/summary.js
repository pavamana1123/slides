After Sämba held them off single-handedly for some time, six warriors of the Kaurava party deprived him of his chariot, broke his bow to pieces, seized him, tied him up and brought both him and Lakñmaëä back to Hastinäpura."

The Lord set off for Hastinäpura, together with several brähmaëas and Yädava elders."

When Uddhava appeared in the Kaurava court and announced Lord Balaräma's arrival, the Kauravas worshiped Uddhava and went to see the Lord, taking auspicious items to offer Him. The Kauravas honored Balaräma with rituals and items of respect, but when He conveyed Ugrasena's demand that they release Sämba, they became angry. \"It is very amazing,\" they said, \"that the Yädavas are trying to give orders to the Kauravas. This is like a shoe trying to climb atop one's head. It is from us alone that the Yädavas have obtained their royal thrones, and yet now they are presuming themselves our equals. No longer will we extend to them royal privileges.\""

Thus He took His plow weapon and, intending to rid the earth of all the Kurus, began dragging Hastinäpura toward the Ganges. Seeing that their city was in imminent danger of falling into the river, the terrified Kauravas quickly brought Sämba and Lakñmaëä before Lord Balaräma and began to glorify Him. Then they prayed, \"O Lord, please forgive us, who were so ignorant of Your true identity.\""
