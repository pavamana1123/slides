Just as Kåñëa had stolen their clothes, He had also stolen their minds and their love. The gopés interpreted the whole incident as proof that Kåñëa was also attached to them. Otherwise, why would He have gone to the trouble of playing with them in this way? Because they thought that Kåñëa was now attached to them, they glanced at Him with shyness, and being stunned by the rising of their ecstatic love, they could not move from where they stood. Kåñëa had overcome their shyness and forced them to come out of the water naked, but now, having dressed properly, they again became shy in His presence. In fact, this incident increased their humbleness before Kåñëa. They did not want Kåñëa to see them staring at Him, but they cautiously took the opportunity to glance at the Lord."
