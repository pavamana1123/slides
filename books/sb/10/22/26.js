Unless one has achieved an advanced degree of devotion, one cannot fix the mind and intelligence on Kåñëa, since Kåñëa is pure spiritual existence. Self-realization is a state not of desirelessness but rather of purified desire, wherein one desires only the pleasure of Lord Kåñëa. The gopés were certainly attracted to Kåñëa in a mood of conjugal love, and yet, having fixed their minds and indeed their entire existence completely on Kåñëa, their conjugal desire could never manifest as material lust; rather, it became the most exalted form of love of Godhead ever seen within the universe."
