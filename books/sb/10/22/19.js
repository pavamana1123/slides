    "translation": "[Lord Kåñëa said:] You girls bathed naked while executing your vow, and that is certainly an offense against the demigods. To counteract your sin you should offer obeisances while placing your joined palms above your heads. Then you should take back your lower garments.",

In other words, the gopés could no longer cover their bodies. We should not foolishly think that Lord Kåñëa is an ordinary lusty boy enjoying the naked beauty of the gopés. Kåñëa is the Supreme Absolute Truth, and He was acting to fulfill the loving desire of the young cowherd girls of Våndävana. In this world we would certainly become lusty in a situation like this. But to compare ourselves to God is a great offense, and because of this offense we will not be able to understand Kåñëa's transcendental position, for we will wrongly take Him to be materially conditioned like ourselves. To lose transcendental sight of Kåñëa is certainly a great disaster for one trying to relish the bliss of the Absolute Truth."
