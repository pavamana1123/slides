Their attempt to gain Kåñëa as their husband was therefore motivated not by a desire for personal sense gratification but by their overwhelming desire to serve Kåñëa and to please Him. Because of their intense love, the gopés did not see Kåñëa as God but rather as the most wonderful boy in all creation, and being beautiful young girls, they desired only to please Him by loving service. Lord Kåñëa understood the pure desire of the gopés and was thus satisfied. The Lord could certainly not be satisfied by ordinary lust, but He was moved by the intense loving devotion of the cowherd girls of Våndävana."
