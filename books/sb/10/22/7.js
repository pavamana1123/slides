To celebrate the successful completion of their vow, the girls invited young Rädhäräëé—the daughter of Våñabhänu and the special object of their affection—along with other important gopés, and brought them all to the river to bathe. Their playing in the water was meant to serve as the avabhåtha-snäna, the ceremonial bath taken immediately upon the completion of a Vedic sacrifice."

The portion of the river where the girls and women take bath was strictly prohibited to any male, and this is still the system. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, knowing the minds of the unmarried young gopés, awarded them their desired objective. They had prayed for Kåñëa to become their husband, and Kåñëa wanted to fulfill their desires.\""
