There is another, superior potency, whose form is on the same spiritual level as that of God Himself. Simply by scientifically understanding this supreme potency, one can immediately achieve the Supreme Soul of all souls, who is the Lord of all lords. There is no other process to achieve Him. That supreme potency of the Lord is known as Gokuleçvaré, the goddess of Gokula. Her nature is to be completely absorbed in love of God, and through Her one can easily obtain the primeval God, the Lord of all that be. This internal potency of the Lord has a covering potency, known as Mahä-mäyä, who rules the material world. In fact she bewilders the entire universe, and thus everyone within the universe falsely identifies himself with the material body.\""

The name Durgä is sometimes used to refer to the internal, superior potency, as stated in the Païcarätra: \"In all mantras used to worship Kåñëa, the presiding deity is known as Durgä.\" Thus in the transcendental sound vibrations glorifying and worshiping the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa, the presiding deity of the particular mantra or hymn is called Durgä. The name Durgä therefore refers also to that personality who functions as the internal potency of the Lord and who is thus on the platform of çuddha-sattva, pure transcendental existence. This internal potency is understood to be Kåñëa's sister, known also as Ekänaàçä or Subhadrä. This is the Durgä who was worshiped by the gopés in Våndävana. Several äcäryas have pointed out that ordinary people are sometimes bewildered and think that the names Mahä-mäyä and Durgä refer exclusively to the external potency of the Lord."

Çréla Prabhupäda comments in this regard: \"The Vaiñëavas generally do not worship any demigods. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura has strictly forbidden all worship of the demigods for anyone who wants to advance in pure devotional service. Yet the gopés, who are beyond compare in their affection for Kåñëa, were seen to worship Durgä. The worshipers of demigods also sometimes mention that the gopés also worshiped goddess Durgä, but we must understand the purpose of the gopés. Generally, people worship goddess Durgä for some material benediction. Here, the gopés could adopt any means to satisfy or serve Kåñëa. That was the superexcellent characteristic of the gopés. They worshiped goddess Durgä completely for one month in order to have Kåñëa as their husband. Every day they prayed for Kåñëa, the son of Nanda Mahäräja, to become their husband.\""

The only motivation in all their activities was simply to love and satisfy Kåñëa, and if we foolishly consider their activities to be mundane in any way, it will be impossible for us to understand Kåñëa consciousness."
