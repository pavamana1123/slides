    "translation": "Thus the young girls of Våndävana, considering what Lord Acyuta had told them, accepted that they had suffered a falldown from their vow by bathing naked in the river. But they still desired to successfully complete their vow, and since Lord Kåñëa is Himself the ultimate result of all pious activities, they offered their obeisances to Him to cleanse away all their sins.",

The gopés decided that it was better to renounce their so-called family tradition and traditional morality and simply surrender unto the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. This does not mean that the Kåñëa consciousness movement advocates immoral activities. In fact, the devotees of ISKCON practice the highest standard of restraint and morality, but at the same time we recognize the transcendental position of Kåñëa. Lord Kåñëa is God and therefore has no material desire to enjoy young girls in sexual affairs. As will be seen in this chapter, Lord Kåñëa was not at all attracted to enjoying the gopés; rather He was attracted to their love and wanted to satisfy them."

In India there is a group called präkåta-sahajiyä, who imitate these affairs of Kåñëa and try to enjoy naked young girls in the name of worshiping Kåñëa. The ISKCON movement sternly rejects this mockery of religion, because the greatest offense is for a human being to ludicrously imitate the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the ISKCON movement there are no cheap incarnations, and it is not possible for a devotee of this movement to promote himself to the position of Kåñëa."

            "content": "Five hundred years ago Kåñëa appeared as Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who practiced strict celibacy throughout His student life and at the age of twenty-four took sannyäsa, a lifelong vow of celibacy. Caitanya Mahäprabhu rigidly avoided contact with women in order to carry out His vow of loving service to Kåñëa. When Kåñëa personally appeared five thousand years ago, He exhibited these wonderful pastimes, which attract our attention. We should not become envious or shocked when we hear that God can perform such pastimes. Our shock is due to our ignorance, because if we tried to perform these activities our bodies would be afflicted by lust. Lord Kåñëa, however, is the Supreme Absolute Truth and is therefore never disturbed by any material desire whatsoever. Thus, this incident—in which the gopés gave up normal standards of morality and, raising their hands to their head, bowed down in compliance with Kåñëa's order—is an example of pure devotional surrender and not a discrepancy in religious principles."

In order to be freed from the wrath of Varuëadeva, as well as to fulfill the desired end of their vows and ultimately to please their worshipable Lord, Kåñëa, they immediately abided by His order. Thus they became the greatest lovers of Kåñëa, and His most obedient servitors."
