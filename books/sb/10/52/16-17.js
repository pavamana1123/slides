    "translation": "O hero among the Kurus, the Supreme Lord Himself, Govinda, married Bhéñmaka's daughter, Vaidarbhé, who was a direct expansion of the goddess of fortune. The Lord did this by her desire, and in the process He beat down Çälva and other kings who took Çiçupäla's side. Indeed, as everyone watched, Çré Kåñëa took Rukmiëé just as Garuòa boldly stole nectar from the demigods.",

            "content": "Çréla Jéva Gosvämé gives the following profound comments on these two verses: The words çriyo mäträm indicate that beautiful Rukmiëé is a direct expansion of the eternal goddess of fortune. Therefore she is worthy to be the bride of the Personality of Godhead. As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38), çriyaù käntä käntaù parama-puruñaù: \"In the spiritual world, all the female lovers are goddesses of fortune and the male lover is the Supreme Personality.\" Thus, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains, Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé is a plenary portion of Çrématé Rädhäräëé. The Kärttika-mähätmya section of the Padma Puräëa states, kaiçore gopa-kanyäs tä yauvane räja-kanyakäù: \"In childhood, Çré Kåñëa enjoyed with the daughters of cowherd men, and in His adolescence He enjoyed with the daughters of kings.\" Similarly, in the Skanda Puräëa we find this statement: rukmiëé dväravatyäà tu rädhä våndävane vane. \"Rukmiëé is in Dvärakä what Rädhä is in the forest of Våndävana.\""

In fact, Çré Kåñëa and Çrématé Rukmiëé chose each other because of their eternal, transcendental love."
