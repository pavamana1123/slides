The King then left the cave and saw that humans, animals, trees and plants were all smaller than when he had fallen asleep. From this he could understand that the age of Kali was at hand. Thus, in a mood of detachment from all material association, the King began worshiping the Supreme Lord, Çré Hari."

He destroyed this army, collected all the valuables the soldiers had been carrying, and set off for Dvärakä. Just then Jaräsandha arrived on the scene with a force of twenty-three akñauhiëés. Lord Balaräma and Lord Kåñëa, acting as if fearful, left Their riches aside and ran far away. Because Jaräsandha could not appreciate Their true power, he ran after Them. After running a long way, Räma and Kåñëa came to a mountain named Pravarñaëa and proceeded to climb it. Jaräsandha thought They had hidden inside a cave and looked all over for Them. Unable to find Them, he built fires on all sides of the mountain. As the vegetation on the mountain slopes burst into flame, Kåñëa and Balaräma jumped off the peak. After reaching the ground unseen by Jaräsandha and his followers, They returned to the Dvärakä fort, which floated within the sea. Jaräsandha decided that Räma and Kåñëa had burned to death in the fire, and he took his army back to his kingdom."

Rukmiëé, the young daughter of Bhéñmaka, King of Vidarbha, had heard of Çré Kåñëa's beauty, strength and other fine qualities, and she therefore made up her mind that He would be the perfect husband for her. Lord Kåñëa also wanted to marry her. But although Rukmiëé's other relatives approved of her marriage to Kåñëa, her brother Rukmé was envious of the Lord and thus forbade her to marry Him. Rukmé wanted her to marry Çiçupäla instead. Rukmiëé unhappily took up her duties in preparation for the marriage, but she also sent a trustworthy brähmaëa to Kåñëa with a letter."

The brähmaëa opened Rukmiëé's letter and showed it to Lord Kåñëa, who had the messenger read it to Him. Rukmiëé-devé wrote, \"Ever since I have heard about You, my Lord, I have become completely attracted to You. Without fail please come before my marriage to Çiçupäla and take me away. In accordance with family custom, on the day before my marriage I will visit the temple of goddess Ambikä. That would be the best opportunity for You to appear and easily kidnap me. If You do not show me this favor, I will give up my life by fasting and observing severe vows. Then perhaps in my next life I will be able to obtain You.\""
