            "content": "Here we have translated the word dharma as \"religious practice,\" although this does not fully convey the Sanskrit sense of the word. Kåñëa did not appear within a secular society. The people in Vedic times could hardly imagine a society that did not understand the need to obey God's law. Thus to them the word dharma conveyed a sense of duty in general, higher principles, prescribed duty and so on. It was automatically understood that such duties were within a religious context. But religion in those days was not a specific aspect or department of life, but rather a guiding light for all activities. Irreligious life was considered demoniac, and God's hand was seen in everything."
