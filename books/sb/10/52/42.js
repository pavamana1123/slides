He certainly would not object to subduing rascals like Çiçupäla and Jaräsandha, but He might be reluctant to injure or kill Rukmiëé's relatives, some of whom might block His way to the palace's inner sanctum, where the women were protected. The procession to or from the temple of Girijä (Durgä) would provide the perfect opportunity for Kåñëa to kidnap Rukmiëé without harming her relatives."
