By using the term guhya-sandeçäù, the trustworthy brähmaëa, personally selected by Rukmiëé, here affirms that he has not violated the confidentiality of this message. Only Lord Kåñëa has heard it. Since the marriage of Rukmiëé was fast approaching, Çré Kåñëa would have to act immediately. The term yadu-deva indicates that Lord Kåñëa, as the Lord of the powerful Yadu dynasty, should make His decision and then mobilize His followers if necessary."
