She advised Çré Kåñëa to enter the city alone and unnoticed and then surround Himself with His military commanders so He could do what was needed. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté compares the coming fight to the Lord's churning of the ocean to extract the goddess Lakñmé. Gorgeous Rukmiëé, the goddess of fortune, would be gained in the coming turbulence."
