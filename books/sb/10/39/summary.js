After the evening meal, Kåñëa asked Akrüra whether his trip had been peaceful and whether he was well. The Lord also inquired about how Kaàsa was behaving toward their family members, and finally He asked why Akrüra had come."

Akrüra also spoke of Kaàsa's desire to bring Kåñëa and Balaräma to Mathurä to kill Them on the pretext of Their seeing the bow sacrifice and engaging in a wrestling match. Kåñëa and Balaräma laughed out loud when They heard this. They went to Their father, Nanda, and informed him of Kaàsa's orders. Nanda then issued an order to all the residents of Vraja that they should collect various offerings for the King and prepare to go to Mathurä."

Condemning the creator for separating them from Him, they began to lament. They said that Akrüra did not deserve his name (a, \"not\"; krüra, \"cruel\"), since he was so cruel to be taking away their dearmost Kåñëa. \"It must be that fate is against us,\" they lamented, \"because otherwise the elders of Vraja would have forbidden Kåñëa to leave. So let us forget our shyness and try to stop Lord Mädhava from going.\" With these words the young cowherd girls began to chant Kåñëa's names and cry."

The cowherd men of Gokula followed behind on their wagons, and the young gopés also walked behind for some distance, but then they became placated by Kåñëa's glances and gestures and pacified by a message from Him that said \"I will return.\" With their minds completely absorbed in Kåñëa, the cowherd girls stood as still as figures in a painting until they could no longer see the chariot's flag or the dust cloud being raised on the road. Then, chanting Kåñëa's glories all the while, they despondently returned to their homes."

After the two Lords had gotten back into the chariot, Akrüra took Their permission to bathe in the Yamunä. As he recited Vedic mantras, he was startled to see the two Lords standing in the water. Akrüra came out of the river and returned to the chariot-where he saw the Lords still sitting. Then he returned to the water to find out if the two figures he had seen there were real or not."

His complexion was dark blue like a fresh raincloud, He wore yellow garments and He lay on the lap of thousand-hooded Ananta Çeña. Lord Väsudeva was receiving the prayers of perfected beings, celestial serpents and demons, and He was encircled by His personal attendants. Serving Him were His many potencies, such as Çré, Puñöi and Ilä, while Brahmä and other demigods sang His praises. Akrüra rejoiced at this vision and, joining his palms in supplication, began to pray to the Supreme Lord in a voice choked with emotion."
