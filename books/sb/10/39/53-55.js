    "translation": "Encircling the Lord and worshiping Him were Nanda, Sunanda and His other personal attendants; Sanaka and the other Kumäras; Brahmä, Rudra and other chief demigods; the nine chief brähmaëas; and the best of the saintly devotees, headed by Prahläda, Närada and Uparicara Vasu. Each of these great personalities was worshiping the Lord by chanting sanctified words of praise in his own unique mood. Also in attendance were the Lord's principal internal potencies—Çré, Puñöi, Gér, Känti, Kérti, Tuñöi, Ilä and Ürjä—as were His material potencies Vidyä, Avidyä and Mäyä, and His internal pleasure potency, Çakti.",

These are the Lord's six opulences. Ilä is His bhü-çakti, also known as sandhiné, the internal potency of whom the element earth is an expansion. Ürjä is His internal potency for performing pastimes; she expands as the tulasé plant in this world. Vidyä and Avidyä [knowledge and ignorance] are external potencies who cause the living entities' liberation and bondage, respectively. Çakti is His internal pleasure potency, hlädiné, and Mäyä is an internal potency who is the basis of Vidyä and Avidyä. The word ca implies the presence of the Lord's marginal energy, the jéva-çakti, who is subordinate to Mäyä. Lord Viñëu was being served by all these personified potencies.\""
