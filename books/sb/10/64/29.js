Since ancient times, Western philosophers have puzzled over the question of how God can be unchanging and yet perform activities. Çrédhara Svämé states that this doubt is answered here by the term ananta-çaktaye, which describes the Lord as \"the possessor of unlimited potency.\" Thus through the Lord's infinite potencies He can perform innumerable activities without changing His essential nature."
