It is also clear that King Någa considered such piety to be a separate goal, desirable for its own sake. Thus he did not fully appreciate pure devotional service to Lord Kåñëa. Kåñëa had not been the only goal of Någa's life, as He was for Ambaréña Mahäräja, even in the stage of regulative practice. Nor do we find that King Någa overcame obstacles like those Ambaréña did when Durväsä Muni became angry at him. Still, we can conclude that since Någa was able to see the Lord for some reason or another, he must have had the good quality of sincerely desiring the Lord's association.\""

The Kåñëa conscious person develops love of God, Kåñëa, not love for pious or impious activities; therefore he is not subjected to the results of such action. As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä, a devotee, by the grace of the Lord, does not become subjected to the resultant reactions of fruitive activities.\""

This devotee was very eager to acquire a temple for a most beautiful Deity of the Supreme Lord, and he also wanted copies of such scriptures as the Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Being very generous, Någa arranged for these things, and the devotee was so satisfied that he blessed the King: 'My dear King, may you have the audience of the Supreme Lord.' From that time on, Någa desired to see the Lord.\""
