The spirit of his prayer is as follows: \"You are Devadeva, God even of the gods, and Jagannätha, the master of the universe, so please be my master. O Govinda, please make me Your property with the same merciful glance You use to enchant the cows. You can do this because You are Puruñottama, the supreme form of Godhead. O Näräyaëa, since You are the foundation of the living entities, please be my support, even though I am a bad living entity. O Håñékeça, please make my senses Your own. O Puëyaçloka, now You have become famous as the deliverer of Någa. O Acyuta, please never be lost to my mind. O Avyaya, You will never diminish in my mind.\" Thus the great Bhägavatam commentator Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains the purport of these verses."
