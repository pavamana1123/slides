Inside a dry well they found an amazing creature: a huge lizard resembling a hill. The boys felt sorry for it and tried to pull it out. But after several attempts with leather thongs and ropes, they saw that they would not be able to rescue the creature, and thus they went to Lord Kåñëa and told Him what had happened. The Lord accompanied them to the well and, extending His left hand, easily lifted the lizard out. By the touch of Lord Kåñëa's hand the creature transformed at once into a demigod. Then Lord Kåñëa asked, \"Who are you, and how did you assume such a lowly form?"

But on one occasion a cow belonging to a first-class brähmaëa wandered into my herd. Unaware of this, I gave this cow in charity to a different brähmaëa. When the cow's previous owner saw the second brähmaëa taking this cow away, the first brähmaëa claimed the cow as his and began arguing with the second brähmaëa. After quarreling for some time they approached me, and I implored them to each take one hundred thousand cows in exchange for that one cow, and to please forgive me for the offense I had unknowingly committed. But neither brähmaëa would accept my proposal, and the matter remained unsettled."
