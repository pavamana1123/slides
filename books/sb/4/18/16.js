The demons born of Diti take great pleasure in drinking wine and beer. Even today people of demoniac nature are very much addicted to liquor and beer. The name of Prahläda Mahäräja is very significant in this connection. Because Prahläda Mahäräja was born in a family of demons, as the son of Hiraëyakaçipu, by his mercy the demons were and still are able to have their drinks in the form of wine and beer. The word ayaù (iron) is very significant. Whereas the nectarean soma was put in a golden pot, the liquors and beers were put in an iron pot. Because the liquor and beer are inferior, they are placed in an iron pot, and because soma-rasa is superior, it is placed in a golden pot."
