Generally they eat flesh and fermented blood, which is mentioned in this verse as kñatajäsavam. The leaders of such degraded men known as Yakñas, Räkñasas, bhütas and piçäcas, are all in the mode of ignorance. They have been placed under the control of Rudra. Rudra is the incarnation of Lord Çiva and is in charge of the mode of ignorance in material nature. Another name of Lord Çiva is Bhütanätha, meaning \"master of ghosts.\" Rudra was born from between Brahmä's eyes when Brahmä was very angry at the four Kumäras."
