    "translation": "Before the reign of King Påthu there was no planned arrangement for different cities, villages, pasturing grounds, etc. Every thing was scattered, and everyone constructed his residential quarters according to his own convenience. However, since King Påthu plans were made for towns and villages.",

            "content": "From this statement it appears that town and city planning is not new but has been coming down since the time of King Påthu. In India we can see regular planning methods evident in very old cities. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam there are many descriptions of such ancient cities. Even five thousand years ago, Lord Kåñëa's capital, Dvärakä, was well planned, and similar other cities—Mathurä and Hastinäpura (now New Delhi)—were also well planned. Thus the planning of cities and towns is not a modern innovation but was existing in bygone ages."
