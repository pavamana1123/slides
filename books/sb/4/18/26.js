            "content": "This is evidence that the Lord supplies food to everyone. As confirmed in the Vedas: eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän. Although the Lord is one, He is supplying all necessities to everyone through the medium of the planet earth. There are different varieties of living entities on different planets, and they all derive their eatables from their planets in different forms. On the basis of these descriptions, how can one assume that there is no living entity on the moon? Every moon is earthly, being composed of the five elements. Every planet produces different types of food according to the needs of its residents. According to the Vedic çästras, it is not true that the moon does not produce food or that no living entity is living there."
