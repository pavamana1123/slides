    "translation": "The four-legged animals like the cows made a calf out of the bull who carries Lord Çiva and made a milking pot out of the forest. Thus they got fresh green grasses to eat. Ferocious animals like tigers transformed a lion into a calf, and thus they were able to get flesh for milk. The birds made a calf out of Garuòa and took milk from the planet earth in the form of moving insects and nonmoving plants and grasses.",

            "content": "There are many carnivorous birds descended from Garuòa, the winged carrier of Lord Viñëu. Indeed, there is a particular type of bird that is very fond of eating monkeys. Eagles are fond of eating goats, and of course many birds eat only fruits and berries. Therefore the words caram, referring to moving animals, and acaram, referring to grasses, fruits and vegetables, are mentioned in this verse."
