    "translation": "After this, the inhabitants of Siddhaloka, as well as the inhabitants of Vidyädhara-loka, transformed the great sage Kapila into a calf, and making the whole sky into a pot, they milked out specific yogic mystic powers, beginning with aëimä. Indeed, the inhabitants of Vidyädhara-loka acquired the art of flying in the sky.",

Just as fish can swim within water, the residents of Vidyädhara-loka can swim in the ocean of air. As far as the inhabitants of Siddhaloka are concerned, they are endowed with all mystic powers. The yogés in this planet practice the eightfold yogic mysticism—namely yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna and samädhi. By regularly practicing the yogic processes one after another, the yogés attain various perfections; they can become smaller than the smallest, heavier than the heaviest, etc. They can even manufacture a planet, get whatever they like and control whatever man they want. All the residents of Siddhaloka are naturally endowed with these mystic yogic powers. It is certainly a very wonderful thing if we see a person on this planet flying in the sky without a vehicle, but in Vidyädhara-loka such flying is as commonplace as a bird's flying in the sky. Similarly, in Siddhaloka all the inhabitants are great yogés, perfect in mystic powers."

Indeed, Kardama Muni prepared a great airplane, which was as large as a small town and had various gardens, palatial buildings, servants and maidservants. With all this paraphernalia, Kapiladeva's mother, Devahüti, and His father, Kardama Muni, traveled all over the universes and visited different planets."
