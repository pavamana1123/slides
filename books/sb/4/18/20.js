In other words, they can exhibit as many wonderful things as one can imagine. The inhabitants of this planet can do whatever they like, or whatever they imagine. Such powers are also mystic powers. The possession of such mystic power is called éçitä. The demons generally learn such mystic powers by the practice of yoga. In the Daçama-skandha, the Tenth Canto, of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, there is a vivid description of how the demons appear before Kåñëa in various wonderful forms. For instance, Bakäsura appeared before Kåñëa and His cowherd boyfriends as a gigantic crane. While present on this planet, Lord Kåñëa had to fight with many demons who could exhibit the wonderful mystic powers of Kimpuruña-loka. Although the inhabitants of Kimpuruña-loka are naturally endowed with such powers, one can attain these powers on this planet by performing different yogic practices."
