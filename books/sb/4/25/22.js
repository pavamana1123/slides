            "content": "The body of intelligence enjoys the objects of sense gratification that cover it, such as smell, vision and hearing. The word sunäsäm (\"beautiful nose\") indicates the organ for acquiring knowledge by smell. Similarly, the mouth is the instrument for acquiring knowledge by taste, for by chewing an object and touching it with the tongue we can understand its taste. The word sukapoläm (\"nice forehead\") indicates a clear brain capable of understanding things as they are. By intelligence one can set things in order. The earrings set upon the two ears are placed there by the work of the intelligence. Thus the ways of acquiring knowledge are described metaphorically."
