The great saint Çaìkaräcärya has described the breasts of women, especially young women, as nothing but a combination of muscles and blood, so one should not be attracted by the illusory energy of raised breasts with nipples. They are agents of mäyä meant to victimize the opposite sex. Because the breasts are equally attractive, they are described as sama-våttau. The sex impulse remains in an old man's heart also, even up to the point of death. To be rid of such agitation, one must be very much advanced in spiritual consciousness, like Yämunäcärya, who said:"

The word nirantarau is significant because although the breasts are situated in different locations, the action is the same. We should not make any distinction between attachment and envy. As described in Bhagavad-gétä , they are both products of rajo-guëa (käma eña krodha eña rajo-guëa-samudbhavaù)."

            "content": "The word nigühantém (\"trying to cover\") indicates that even if one is tainted by käma, lobha, krodha, etc., they can be transfigured by Kåñëa consciousness. In other words, one can utilize käma (lust) for serving Kåñëa. Being impelled by lust, an ordinary worker will work hard day and night; similarly a devotee can work hard day and night to satisfy Kåñëa. Just as karmés are working hard to satisfy käma-krodha, a devotee should work in the same way to satisfy Kåñëa. Similarly, krodha (anger) can also be used in the service of Kåñëa when it is applied to the nondevotee demons. Hanumänjé applied his anger in this way. He was a great devotee of Lord Rämacandra, and he utilized his anger to set fire to the kingdom of Rävaëa, a nondevotee demon. Thus käma (lust) can be utilized to satisfy Kåñëa, and krodha (anger) can be utilized to punish the demons. When both are used for Kåñëa's service, they lose their material significance and become spiritually important."
