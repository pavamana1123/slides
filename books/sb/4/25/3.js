            "content": "As pointed out by Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté Öhäkura, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, kaivalya, or merging into the Brahman effulgence, is just like going to hell. He similarly states that elevation to the upper planetary systems for the enjoyment of heavenly life is just so much phantasmagoria. This means that a devotee does not give any importance to the ultimate goal of the karmés and jïänés. The ultimate goal of the karmés is promotion to the heavenly kingdom, and the ultimate goal of the jïänés is merging into the Brahman effulgence. Of course, the jïänés are superior to the karmés, as confirmed by Lord Caitanya. Koöi-karmaniñöha-madhye eka 'jïäné' çreñöha: \"one jïäné, or impersonalist, is better than many thousands of fruitive actors.\"  Therefore a devotee never enters upon the path of karma, or elevation by fruitive activities. Närada Muni took compassion upon King Präcénabarhiñat when he saw the King engaged in fruitive activity. In comparison to mundane workers, those who are trying to be elevated to the higher planetary systems by performing yajïas are undoubtedly superior. In pure devotional service, however, both karma and jïäna are considered bewildering features of the illusory energy."
