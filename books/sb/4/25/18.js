            "content": "In this verse the word hima-nirjhara is particularly significant. The waterfall represents a kind of liquid humor or rasa (relationship). In the body there are different types of humor, rasa or mellow. The supreme mellow (relationship) is called the sexual mellow (ädi-rasa). When this ädi-rasa, or sex desire, comes in contact with the spring air moved by Cupid, it becomes agitated. In other words, all these are representations of rüpa, rasa, gandha, çabda and sparça. The wind is sparça, or touch. The waterfall is rasa, or taste. The spring air (kusumäkara) is smell. All these varieties of enjoyment make life very pleasing, and thus we become captivated by material existence."
