            "content": "The gate on the western side of the city was known as Äsuré because it was especially meant for the asuras. The word asura refers to those who are interested in sense gratification, specifically in sex life, to which they are overly attracted. Thus Puraïjana, the living entity, enjoys himself to his greatest satisfaction by means of the genitals. Consequently he used to go to the place known as Grämaka. Material sense gratification is also called grämya, and the place where sex life is indulged in to a great extent is called Grämaka. When going to Grämaka, Puraïjana used to be accompanied by his friend Durmada. The word viñaya refers to the four bodily necessities of life—eating, sleeping, mating and defending. The word durmadena may be analyzed in this way: dur means duñöa, or \"sinful,\" and mada means \"madness.\" Every living entity who is in contact with material nature is called mada, or mad. It is said:"

            "content": "The words äsuré näma paçcäd dväù are significant in another sense. The sunrise is first visible from the eastern side—the Bay of Bengal—and gradually it progresses toward the west. It is practically experienced that people in the West are more addicted to sense gratification. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu Himself has certified: paçcimera loka saba müòha anäcära . The more one goes to the western side, the more he will find people disinterested in spiritual life. He will find them behaving against the Vedic standards. Because of this, people living in the West are more addicted to sense gratification. In this Bhägavatam it is confirmed: äsuré näma paçcäd dväù. In other words, the population on the western side is interested in an asuric civilization, that is, a materialistic way of life. Lord Caitanya consequently wanted this Kåñëa consciousness movement to be preached on the western side of the world so that people addicted to sense gratification might be benefited by His teachings."
