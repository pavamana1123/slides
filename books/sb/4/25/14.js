The wrinkles and depressions on different parts of the body are compared to trenches or canals, the eyes are compared to windows, and the eyelids are compared to protective gates. The three types of metal—gold, silver and iron—represent the three modes of material nature. Gold represents goodness; silver, passion; and iron, ignorance. The body is also sometimes considered to be a bag containing three elements (tri-dhätu): mucus, bile and air (kapha, pitta and väyu). Yasyätma-buddhiù kuëape tri-dhätuke. According to Bhägavatam , one who considers this bag of mucus, bile and air to be the self is considered no better than a cow or an ass."
