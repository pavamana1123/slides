The vital force is compared to a serpent because a serpent can live by simply drinking air. The vital force carried by the air is described as the pratéhära, or the bodyguard. Without the vital force one cannot live for a moment. Indeed, all the senses are working under the protection of the vital force."

            "content": "The woman, who represents intelligence, was searching after a husband. This indicates that intelligence cannot act without consciousness. A beautiful woman is useless unless protected by the proper husband. Intelligence must always be very fresh; therefore the word aprauòhäm (\"very young\") is used here. Material enjoyment means utilizing the intelligence for the sake of rüpa, rasa, gandha, çabda and sparça, or form, taste, smell, sound and touch."
