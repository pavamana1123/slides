    "translation": "Those who are interested only in a so-called beautiful life—namely remaining as a householder entangled by sons and a wife and searching after wealth—think that such things are life's ultimate goal. Such people simply wander in different types of bodies throughout this material existence without finding out the ultimate goal of life.",

Prahläda Mahäräja has likened these pseudo occupational duties to a dark well (andha-küpam). Prahläda has purposefully spoken of this dark well because if one falls into this well, he will die. He may cry for help, but no one will hear him or come to rescue him."

            "content": "The words bhrämyan saàsära-vartmasu are significant. In Caitanya-caritämåta , Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu very clearly explains: brahmäëòa bhramite kona bhägyavän jéva. All living entities are wandering in different types of bodies throughout different planets, and if, in the course of their wanderings, they come in contact with a devotee by the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, their lives become successful. Even though King Präcénabarhiñat was engaged in fruitive activity, the great sage Närada appeared before him. The King was very fortunate to be able to associate with Närada, who enlightened him in spiritual knowledge. It is the duty of all saintly persons to follow in the footsteps of Närada Muni and travel all over the world to every country and village just to instruct illusioned persons about the goal of life and to save them from the entanglement of karma-bandha, fruitive activity."
