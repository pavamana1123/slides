            "content": "By this incident we can understand that when a man is aggressive and begins to woo a woman, the woman becomes attracted to the man. This process is described in the Bhägavatam  as puàsaù striyä mithuné-bhävam etam. This attraction is enacted on the platform of sexual life. Thus the sex impulse is the platform of material engagement. This conditional life, the platform of material sense enjoyment, is the cause of forgetfulness of spiritual life. In this way a living entity's original Kåñëa consciousness becomes covered or converted into material consciousness. Thus one engages in the business of sense gratification."
