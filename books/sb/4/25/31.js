When thus attracted by the beauty of the material energy, one becomes very eager to enjoy. This is elaborately described in this instance of Puraïjana's becoming attracted by the beautiful woman. In conditional life the living entity is attracted by a face, eyebrows or eyes, a voice or anything. In short, everything becomes attractive. When a man or a woman is attracted by the opposite sex, it does not matter whether the opposite sex is beautiful or not. The lover sees everything beautiful in the face of the beloved and thus becomes attracted. This attraction causes the living entity to fall down in this material world. This is described in Bhagavad-gétä :"

By avidyä (ignorance) one becomes conditioned, and by vidyä (knowledge) one becomes liberated. Puraïjana admits herein that he is attracted by avidyä. Now he wishes to see the complete feature of avidyä and so requests the girl to raise her head so that he can see her face to face. He thus wishes to see the various features that make avidyä attractive."
