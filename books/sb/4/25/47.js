Although both eyes are constructed in one place, one is stronger than the other in the power to see. The king, or the living entity, uses these two gates to see things properly, but he cannot see unless accompanied by a friend whose name is Dyumän. This friend is the sun. Although the two eyes are situated in one place, they have no power to see without the sunlight. Vibhräjitaà janapadam. If one wants to see something very clearly (vibhräjitam), he must see it with two eyes and the assistance of his friend the sunlight. Within this body everyone is a king because he uses his different gates according to his own will. Although he is very much proud of his power to see or hear, he is nonetheless dependent on the assistance of nature."
