            "content": "It is sometimes seen that devotees of Lord Çiva imitate the characteristics of Lord Çiva. For example, Lord Çiva drank an ocean of poison, so some of the followers of Lord Çiva imitate him and try to take intoxicants like gäïjä (marijuana). Here the curse is that if someone follows such principles he must become an infidel and turn against the principles of Vedic regulation. It is said that such devotees of Lord Çiva will be sacchästra-paripanthinaù, which means \"opposed to the conclusion of çästra, or scripture.\" This is confirmed in the Padma Puräëa also. Lord Çiva was ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to preach the impersonal, or Mäyäväda, philosophy for a particular purpose, just as Lord Buddha preached the philosophy of voidness for particular purposes mentioned in the çästras."

            "content": "Sometimes it is necessary to preach a philosophical doctrine which is against the Vedic conclusion. In the Çiva Puräëa it is stated that Lord Çiva said to Pärvaté that in the Kali-yuga, in the body of a brähmaëa, he would preach the Mäyäväda philosophy. Thus it is generally found that the worshipers of Lord Çiva are Mäyävädé followers. Lord Çiva himself says, mäyävädam asac-chästram. Asat-çästra, as explained here, means the doctrine of Mäyäväda impersonalism, or becoming one with the Supreme. Bhågu Muni cursed that persons who worshiped Lord Çiva would become followers of this Mäyäväda asat-çästra, which attempts to establish that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is impersonal. Besides that, among the worshipers of Lord Çiva there is a section who live a devilish life. Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Närada-païcarätra are authorized scriptures that are considered sat-çästra, or scriptures which lead one to the path of God realization. Asat-çästras are just the opposite."
