            "content": "Because of this curse, Çiva was deprived of his share in the oblations of Vedic sacrifices. It was due to the curse of Dakña, Çré Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments in this connection, that Lord Çiva was saved from the calamity of taking part with other demigods, who were all materialistic. Lord Çiva is the greatest devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and it is not fitting for him to eat or sit with materialistic persons like the demigods. Thus the curse of Dakña was indirectly a blessing, for Çiva would not have to eat or sit with other demigods, who were too materialistic. There is a practical example set for us by Gaurakiçora däsa Bäbäjé Mahäräja, who used to sit on the side of a latrine to chant Hare Kåñëa. Many materialistic persons used to come and bother him and disturb his daily routine of chanting, so to avoid their company he used to sit by the side of a latrine, where materialistic persons would not go because of the filth and the obnoxious smell. However, Gaurakiçora däsa Bäbäjé Mahäräja was so great that he was accepted as the spiritual master of such a great personality as His Divine Grace Oà Viñëupäda Çré Çrémad Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Gosvämé Mahäräja. The conclusion is that Lord Çiva behaved in his own way to avoid materialistic persons who might disturb him in his prosecution of devotional service."
