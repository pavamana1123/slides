Lord Çiva is described here as the best of the gentle because he is not envious of anyone, he is equal to all living entities, and all other good qualities are present in his personality. The word çiva means \"all auspicious.\" No one can be an enemy of Lord Çiva's, for he is so peaceful and renounced that he does not even construct a house for his residence, but lives underneath a tree, always detached from all worldly things. The personality of Lord Çiva symbolizes the best of gentleness. Why, then, was Dakña, who offered his beloved daughter to such a gentle personality, inimical towards Lord Çiva so intensely that Saté, the daughter of Dakña and wife of Lord Çiva, gave up her body?"
