    "translation": "My dear Vidura, carrier of bows and arrows, all the demigods who were performing the sacrifice took their bath at the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamunä after completing the yajïa performance. Such a bath is called avabhåtha-snäna. After thus becoming purified in heart, they departed for their respective abodes.",

            "content": "After Lord Çiva and, previously, Dakña, left the arena of sacrifice, the sacrifice was not stopped; the sages went on for many years in order to satisfy the Supreme Lord. The sacrifice was not destroyed for want of Çiva and Dakña, and the sages went on with their activities. In other words, it may be assumed that if one does not worship the demigods, even up to Lord Çiva and Brahmä, one can nevertheless satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä  it is stated, ye 'py anya-devatä-bhaktä yajante çraddhayänvitäù. The Lord says that anyone who worships the demigods is also worshiping Him, but he is worshiping avidhi-pürvakam, which means \"without following the regulative principles.\" The regulative principle is to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Worship of demigods may indirectly be worship of the Personality of Godhead, but it is not regulated. By worshiping the Supreme Lord, one automatically serves all the demigods because they are parts and parcels of the whole. If one supplies water to the root of a tree, all the parts of the tree, such as the leaves and branches, are automatically satisfied, and if one supplies food to the stomach, all the limbs of the body—the hands, legs, fingers, etc.—are nourished. Thus by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead one can satisfy all the demigods, but by worshiping all the demigods one does not completely worship the Supreme Lord. Therefore worship of the demigods is irregular, and it is disrespectful to the scriptural injunctions."
