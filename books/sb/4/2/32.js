            "content": "Lord Çiva is described here as bhüta-räö. The ghosts and those who are situated in the material mode of ignorance are called bhütas, so bhüta-räö refers to the leader of the creatures who are in the lowest standard of the material modes of nature. Another meaning of bhüta is anyone who has taken birth or anything which is produced, so in that sense Lord Çiva may be accepted as the father of this material world. Here, of course, Bhågu Muni takes Lord Çiva as the leader of the lowest creatures. The characteristics of the lowest class of men have already been described—they do not bathe, they have long hair on their heads, and they are addicted to intoxicants. In comparison with the path followed by the followers of Bhütaräö, the Vedic system is certainly excellent, for it promotes people to spiritual life as the highest eternal principle of human civilization. If one decries or blasphemes the Vedic principles, then he falls to the standard of atheism."
