In other words, he was in complete knowledge that he was speaking against Lord Çiva in spite of Çiva's spotless character. As far as envy is concerned, from the very beginning he was envious of Lord Çiva; therefore he could not distinguish his own particular envy. Although he spoke like a man in ignorance, he wanted to cover his statements by saying that he was not speaking for impudent and envious reasons."
