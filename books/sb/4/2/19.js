            "content": "Anger is so detrimental that even a great personality like Dakña, out of anger, left the arena where Brahmä was presiding and all the great sages and pious and saintly persons were assembled. All of them requested him not to leave, but, infuriated, he left, thinking that the auspicious place was not fit for him. Puffed up by his exalted position, he thought that no one was greater than he in argument. It appears that all the members of the assembly, including Lord Brahmä, requested him not to be angry and leave their company, but in spite of all these requests, he left. That is the effect of cruel anger. In Bhagavad-gétä, therefore, it is advised that one who desires to make tangible advancement in spiritual consciousness must avoid three things—lust, anger and the mode of passion. Actually we can see that lust, anger and passion make a man crazy, even though he be as great as Dakña. The very name Dakña suggests that he was expert in all material activities, but still, because of his aversion towards such a saintly personality as Çiva, he was attacked by these three enemies—anger, lust and passion. Lord Caitanya, therefore, advised that one be very careful not to offend Vaiñëavas. He compared offenses toward a Vaiñëava to a mad elephant. As a mad elephant can do anything horrible, so when a person offends a Vaiñëava he can perform any abominable action."
