Human civilization is based on the qualitative divisions of social order, namely the intelligent class, the martial class, the productive class and the laborer class. The Vedas provide the right direction for advancing in spiritual cultivation and economic development and regulating the principle of sense gratification, so that ultimately one may be liberated from material contamination to his real state of spiritual identification (ahaà brahmäsmi). As long as one is in the contamination of material existence, one changes bodies from the aquatics up to the position of Brahmä, but the human form of life is the highest perfectional life in the material world. The Vedas give directions by which to elevate oneself in the next life. The Vedas are the mother for such instructions, and the brähmaëas, or persons who are in knowledge of the Vedas, are the father. Thus if one blasphemes the Vedas and brähmaëas, naturally one goes down to the status of atheism. The exact word used in Sanskrit is nästika, which refers to one who does not believe in the Vedas but manufactures some concocted system of religion. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has said that the followers of the Buddhist system of religion are nästikas. In order to establish his doctrine of nonviolence, Lord Buddha flatly refused to believe in the Vedas, and thus, later on, Çaìkaräcärya stopped this system of religion in India and forced it to go outside India. Here it is stated, brahma ca brähmaëän. Brahma means the Vedas. Ahaà brahmäsmi means \"I am in full knowledge.\" The Vedic assertion is that one should think that he is Brahman, for actually he is Brahman. If brahma, or the Vedic spiritual science, is condemned, and the masters of the spiritual science, the brähmaëas, are condemned, then where does human civilization stand? Bhågu Muni said, \"It is not due to my cursing that you shall become atheists; you are already situated in the principle of atheism. Therefore you are condemned.\""
