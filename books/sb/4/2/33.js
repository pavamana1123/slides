    "translation": "The sage Maitreya said: When such cursing and countercursing was going on between Lord Çiva's followers and the parties of Dakña and Bhågu, Lord Çiva became very morose. Not saying anything, he left the arena of the sacrifice, followed by his disciples.",

In spite of the cursing and countercursing between the parties of Dakña and Çiva, because he is the greatest Vaiñëava he was so sober that he did not say anything. A Vaiñëava is always tolerant, and Lord Çiva is considered the topmost Vaiñëava, so his character, as shown in this scene, is excellent. He became morose because he knew that these people, both his men and Dakña's, were unnecessarily cursing and countercursing one another, without any interest in spiritual life. From his point of view, he did not see anyone as lower or higher, because he is a Vaiñëava. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , paëòitäù sama-darçinaù: one who is perfectly learned does not see anyone as lesser or greater, because he sees everyone from the spiritual platform. Thus the only alternative left to Lord Çiva was to leave in order to stop his follower, Nandéçvara, as well as Bhågu Muni, from cursing and countercursing in that way."
