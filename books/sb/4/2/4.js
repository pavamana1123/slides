Thus begins the history of a great sacrifice performed by the leaders of the universal creation, namely Maréci, Dakña and Vasiñöha. These great personalities arranged for a great sacrifice, for which demigods like Indra and the fire-gods assembled with their followers. Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva were also present."
