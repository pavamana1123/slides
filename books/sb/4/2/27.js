            "content": "The word duratyaya is particularly used in reference to a brahmadaëòa, or curse by a brähmaëa. A curse by a brähmaëa is very strong; therefore it is called duratyaya, or insurmountable. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-gétä, the stringent laws of nature are insurmountable; similarly, if a curse is uttered by a brähmaëa, that curse is also insurmountable. But Bhagavad-gétä also says that the curses or benedictions of the material world are, after all, material creations. The Caitanya-caritämåta confirms that that which is accepted in this material world to be a benediction and that which is taken to be a curse are both on the same platform because they are material. To get out of this material contamination, one should take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as recommended in Bhagavad-gétä : mäm eva ye prapadyante mäyäm etäà taranti te. The best path is to transcend all material curses and benedictions and take shelter of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, and remain in a transcendental position. Persons who have taken shelter of Kåñëa are always peaceful; they are never cursed by anyone, nor do they attempt to curse anyone. That is a transcendental position."
