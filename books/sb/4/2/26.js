            "content": "The third curse inflicted by Nandéçvara on the brähmaëas who supported Dakña is completely functioning in the age of Kali. The so-called brähmaëas are no longer interested in understanding the nature of the Supreme Brahman, although a brähmaëa means one who has attained knowledge about Brahman. In the Vedänta-sütra also it is stated, athäto brahma jijïäsä: this human form of life is meant for realization of the Supreme Brahman, the Absolute Truth, or, in other words, human life is meant for one's elevation to the post of a brähmaëa. Unfortunately the modern brähmaëas, or so-called brähmaëas who come in originally brahminical families, have left their own occupational duties, but they do not allow others to occupy the posts of brähmaëas. The qualifications for brähmaëas are described in the scriptures, in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Bhagavad-gétä and all other Vedic literatures. Brähmaëa is not a hereditary title or position. If someone from a non-brähmaëa family (for example, one born in a family of çüdras) tries to become a brähmaëa by being properly qualified under the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, these so-called brähmaëas will object. Such brähmaëas, having been cursed by Nandéçvara, are actually in a position where they have no discrimination between eatables and noneatables and simply live to maintain the perishable material body and its family. Such fallen conditioned souls are not worthy to be called brähmaëas, but in Kali-yuga they claim to be brähmaëas, and if a person actually tries to attain the brahminical qualifications, they try to hinder his progress. This is the situation in the present age. Caitanya Mahäprabhu condemned this principle very strongly. During His conversation with Rämänanda Räya, He said that regardless of whether a person is born in a brähmaëa family or çüdra family, regardless of whether he is a householder or a sannyäsé, if he knows the science of Kåñëa he must be a spiritual master. Caitanya Mahäprabhu had many so-called çüdra disciples like Haridäsa Öhäkura and Rämänanda Räya. Even the Gosvämés, who were principal students of Lord Caitanya, were also ostracized from brähmaëa society, but Caitanya Mahäprabhu, by His grace, made them first-class Vaiñëavas."
