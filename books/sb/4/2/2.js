            "content": "Lord Çiva is described here as caräcara-guru, the spiritual master of all animate and inanimate objects. He is sometimes known as Bhütanätha, which means \"the worshipable deity of the dull-headed.\" Bhüta is also sometimes taken to indicate the ghosts. Lord Çiva takes charge of reforming persons who are ghosts and demons, not to speak of others, who are godly; therefore he is the spiritual master of everyone, both the dull and demoniac and the highly learned Vaiñëavas. It is also stated, vaiñëavänäà yathä çambhuù: Çambhu, Lord Çiva, is the greatest of all Vaiñëavas. On one hand he is the worshipable object of the dull demons, and on the other he is the best of all Vaiñëavas, or devotees, and he has a sampradäya called the Rudra-sampradäya. Even if he is an enemy or is sometimes angry, such a personality cannot be the object of envy, so Vidura, in astonishment, asked why he was taken as such, especially by Dakña. Dakña is also not an ordinary person. He is a Prajäpati, in charge of fathering population, and all his daughters are highly elevated, especially Sati. The word saté means \"the most chaste.\" Whenever there is consideration of chastity, Sati, this wife of Lord Çiva and daughter of Dakña, is considered first. Vidura, therefore, was astonished. \"Dakña is such a great man,\" he thought, \"and is the father of Sati. And Lord Çiva is the spiritual master of everyone. How then could there possibly be so much enmity between them that Sati, the most chaste goddess, could give up her body because of their quarrel?\""
