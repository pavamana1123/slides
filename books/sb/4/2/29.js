By such behavior one becomes devoid of transcendental knowledge. In the initiation into the Çiva mantra there are mudrikäñöaka, in which it is sometimes recommended that one make his sitting place on the vagina and thus desire nirväëa, or dissolution of existence. In that process of worship, wine is needed, or sometimes, in place of wine, palm tree juice which is converted into an intoxicant. This is also offered according to Çiva-ägama, a scripture on the method of worshiping Lord Çiva."
