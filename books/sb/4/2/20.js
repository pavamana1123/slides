    "translation": "Upon understanding that Lord Çiva had been cursed, Nandéçvara, one of Lord Çiva's principal associates, became greatly angry. His eyes became red, and he prepared to curse Dakña and all the brähmaëas present there who had tolerated Dakña's cursing Çiva in harsh words.",

            "content": "There is a long-standing dissension among some of the neophyte Vaiñëavas and Çaivites; they are always at loggerheads. When Dakña cursed Lord Çiva in harsh words, some of the brähmaëas present might have enjoyed it because some brähmaëas do not very much admire Lord Çiva. This is due to their ignorance of Lord Çiva's position. Nandéçvara was affected by the cursing, but he did not follow the example of Lord Çiva, who was also present there. Although Lord Çiva could also have cursed Dakña in a similar way, he was silent and tolerant; but Nandéçvara, his follower, was not tolerant. Of course, as a follower it was right for him not to tolerate an insult to his master, but he should not have cursed the brähmaëas who were present. The entire issue was so complicated that those who were not strong enough forgot their positions, and thus cursing and countercursing went on in that great assembly. In other words, the material field is so unsteady that even personalities like Nandéçvara, Dakña and many of the brähmaëas present were infected by the atmosphere of anger."
