The words used against Lord Çiva by Dakña can also be understood in a different way, in a good sense. For example, he stated that Çiva is yaço-ghna, which means \"one who spoils name and fame.\" So this can also be interpreted to mean that he was so famous that his fame killed all other fame. Again, Dakña used the word nirapatrapa, which also can be used in two senses. One sense is \"one who is stunted,\" and another sense is \"one who is the maintainer of persons who have no other shelter.\" Generally Lord Çiva is known as the lord of the bhütas, or lower grade of living creatures. They take shelter of Lord Çiva because he is very kind to everyone and is very quickly satisfied. Therefore he is called Äçutoña. To such men, who cannot approach other demigods or Viñëu, Lord Çiva gives shelter. Therefore the word nirapatrapa can be used in that sense."
