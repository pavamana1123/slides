    "translation": "The great sage Maitreya said: After the Personality of Godhead spoke thus, the Pracetäs began to offer Him prayers. The Lord is the bestower of all success in life and is the supreme benefactor. He is also the supreme friend who takes away all miserable conditions experienced by a devotee. In a faltering voice, due to ecstasy, the Pracetäs began to offer prayers. They were purified by the presence of the Lord, who was before them face to face.",

Since the Pracetäs had already attained the Lord's mercy, they were no longer subject to the contamination of the material modes. The material modes dissipated from them just as the darkness of night immediately dissipates when the sun rises. Because the Lord appeared before them, naturally all the contaminations of the material qualities of rajas and tamas completely disappeared. Similarly, when an unalloyed devotee chants the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, he is also purified of all material contamination because the name of the Lord and the Lord are identical. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

The Pracetäs were already purified due to the Lord's presence before them, and they could therefore offer the proper prayers with folded hands. In other words, as soon as devotees are engaged in devotional service, they become transcendental to all material contamination immediately, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (sa guëän samatétyaitän brahma-bhüyäya kalpate ). Sometimes the devotees are dissatisfied due to their not seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead personally. When the Pracetäs saw the Supreme Lord personally present, their unhappiness vanished."
