    "translation": "Those who are engaged in auspicious activities in devotional service certainly understand that the ultimate enjoyer or beneficiary of all activities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus when one acts, he offers the results to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and passes life always engaged in the topics of the Lord. Even though such a person may be participating in family life, he is not affected by the results of his actions.",

Such a person is called a jévan-mukta, one who is liberated during this lifetime. Devoid of Kåñëa consciousness, those who engage in material activities simply become more entangled in material bondage. They have to suffer and enjoy the actions and reactions of all activity. This Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore the greatest boon to humanity because it keeps one always engaged in Kåñëa's service. The devotees think of Kåñëa, act for Kåñëa, eat for Kåñëa, sleep for Kåñëa and work for Kåñëa. Thus everything is engaged in the service of Kåñëa. A total life in Kåñëa consciousness saves one from material contamination. As stated by Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Gosvämé Mahäräja:"

The conclusion is that these are not one and the same. Material activities for sense gratification are the cause of material bondage, whereas the very same activities for the satisfaction of Kåñëa are the cause of liberation. How the same activity can be the cause of bondage and liberation can be explained as follows. One may get indigestion due to eating too many milk preparations—condensed milk, sweet rice, and so on. But even though there is indigestion or diarrhea, another milk preparation—yogurt mixed with black pepper and salt—will immediately cure these maladies. In other words, one milk preparation can cause indigestion and diarrhea, and another milk preparation can cure them."

When a mature devotee is blessed with material opulence, he does not become affected adversely, for he knows how to employ material opulence in the service of the Lord. There are many such examples in the history of the world. There were kings like Påthu Mahäräja, Prahläda Mahäräja, Janaka, Dhruva, Vaivasvata Manu and Mahäräja Ikñväku. All of these were great kings and were especially favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If a devotee is not mature, the Supreme Lord will take away all his opulence. This principle is stated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead-yasyäham anugåhëämi hariñye tad-dhanaà çanaiù: \"My first mercy shown to My devotee is to take away all his material opulence.\" Material opulence detrimental to devotional service is taken away by the Supreme Lord, whereas a person who is mature in devotional service is given all material facilities."
