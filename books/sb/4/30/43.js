    "translation": "The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the protector of surrendered souls, being thus addressed by the Pracetäs and worshiped by them, replied, \"May whatever you have prayed for be fulfilled.\" After saying this, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose prowess is never defeated, left. The Pracetäs were unwilling to be separated from Him because they had not seen Him to their full satisfaction.",

            "content": "The word anapavarga-vérya is significant in this verse. The word ana means \"without,\" pavarga means \"the materialistic way of life,\" and vérya means \"prowess.\" The prowess of the Supreme Personality of Godhead always contains six basic opulences, one of which is renunciation. Although the Pracetäs desired to see the Lord to their full satisfaction, the Lord left. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, this is an exhibition of His kindness to innumerable other devotees. Although He was being attracted by the Pracetäs, He left. This is an example of His renunciation. This renunciation was also exhibited by Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu when He stayed with Advaita Prabhu after taking sannyäsa. All the devotees there wanted Him to stay a few days longer, but Lord Caitanya left without hesitation. The conclusion is that although the Supreme Lord has unlimited kindness for His devotees, He is not attached to anyone. He is equally kind to His innumerable devotees all over the creation."
