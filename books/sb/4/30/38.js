    "translation": "Dear Lord, by virtue of a moment's association with Lord Çiva, who is very dear to You and who is Your most intimate friend, we were fortunate to attain You. You are the most expert physician, capable of treating the incurable disease of material existence. On account of our great fortune, we have been able to take shelter at Your lotus feet.",

Without taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, one cannot attain relief from the clutches of mäyä, the repetition of birth, old age, disease and death. The Pracetäs received the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the grace of Lord Çiva. Lord Çiva is the supreme devotee of Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vaiñëavänäà yathä çambhuù: the most exalted Vaiñëava is Lord Çiva, and those who are actually devotees of Lord Çiva follow Lord Çiva's advice and take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Viñëu. The so-called devotees of Lord Çiva, who are simply after material prosperity, are in a way deceived by Lord Çiva. He does not actually deceive them, because Lord Çiva has no business deceiving people, but because the so-called devotees of Lord Çiva want to be deceived, Lord Çiva, who is very easily pleased, allows them all kinds of material benedictions. These benedictions might ironically result in the destruction of the so-called devotees. For instance, Rävaëa took all material benediction from Lord Çiva, but the result was that he was ultimately destroyed with his family, kingdom and everything else because he misused Lord Çiva's benediction. Because of his material power, he became very proud and puffed up so that he dared kidnap the wife of Lord Rämacandra. In this way he was ruined. To get material benedictions from Lord Çiva is not difficult, but actually these are not benedictions. The Pracetäs received benediction from Lord Çiva, and as a result they attained the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Viñëu. This is real benediction. The gopés also worshiped Lord Çiva in Våndävana, and the lord is still staying there as Gopéçvara. The gopés, however, prayed that Lord Çiva bless them by giving them Lord Kåñëa as their husband. There is no harm in worshiping the demigods, provided that one's aim is to return home, back to Godhead. Generally people go to the demigods for material benefit, as indicated in Bhagavad-gétä :"

In this connection it is to be noted that sometimes in revealed scriptures Lord Çiva is described as being nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The point is that Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu are so intimately connected that there is no difference in opinion. The actual fact is, ekale éçvara kåñëa, ära saba bhåtya: \"The only supreme master is Kåñëa, and all others are His devotees or servants.\" . Viñëu is honored and offered obeisances by Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä. To consider that they are all equal is a great offense. They are all equal in the sense that Lord Viñëu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and all others are His eternal servants."
