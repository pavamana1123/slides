Lord Brahmä also came when Hiraëyakaçipu underwent severe penances and austerities and made the whole universe tremble. A responsible man in any establishment is always alert to keep peace and harmony within the establishment. Similarly, Lord Brahmä is also allowed to keep peace and harmony within this universe. He consequently pacified the sons of King Barhiñmän with good logic."
