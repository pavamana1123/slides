    "translation": "The Lord's face was very beautiful, and His head was decorated with a shining helmet and golden ornaments. The helmet was dazzling and was very beautifully situated on His head. The Lord had eight arms, which each held a particular weapon. The Lord was surrounded by demigods, great sages and other associates. These were all engaged in His service. Garuòa, the carrier of the Lord, glorified the Lord with Vedic hymns by flapping his wings. Garuòa appeared to be an inhabitant of the planet known as Kinnaraloka.",

However, here Lord Viñëu is described as possessing eight arms with eight kinds of weapons. According to Véraräghava Äcärya, the conchshell and lotus flower are also accepted as weapons. Since the Lord is the supreme controller, whatever is in His hand can be considered a weapon. Four hands hold four kinds of weapons, and the extra four hands hold an arrow, bow, trident and snake. Çré Véraräghava Äcärya describes the eight weapons as çaìkha, cakra, gadä, padma, çärìga, çara, etc."

            "content": "A king is always accompanied by his ministers, secretaries and commanders, and Lord Viñëu is also accompanied by His followers—the demigods, great sages, saintly persons and so on. He is never alone. Consequently there is no question of the Lord's being impersonal. He is always Himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His associates are also persons. From the description given in this verse, Garuòa appears to belong to the Kinnara planet. The inhabitants of the Kinnara planet have the same features as Garuòa. Their bodily features are like those of a human being, but they have wings. The word géta-kértiù indicates that the inhabitants of Kinnaraloka are very expert in singing the glories of the Lord. In Brahma-saàhitä it is said: jagad-aëòa-koöi-koöiñv açeña-vasudhädi-vibhüti-bhinnam. In each and every universe there are different types of planets, and each planet has distinctive features. On the strength of this verse, we can understand that in Kinnaraloka the inhabitants can fly with their wings. There is also a planet, known as Siddhaloka, where the inhabitants can fly even without wings. Thus each and every planet has some distinctive facility. That is the beauty of the varied creation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
