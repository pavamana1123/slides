            "content": "The daughter of the trees is referred to in text 13 of this chapter. This daughter was born of Kaëòu and Pramlocä. The society girl Pramlocä, after giving birth to the child, immediately left for the heavenly kingdom. While the child was crying, the king of the moon took compassion upon her and saved her by putting his finger into her mouth. This child was cared for by the trees, and when she grew up, by the order of Lord Brahmä, she was delivered to the Pracetäs as their wife. The name of the girl was Märiñä, as the next verse will explain. It was the predominating deity of the trees that delivered the daughter. In this connection, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé Prabhupäda states, våkñäù tad-adhiñöhätå-devatäù: \"The 'trees' means the controlling deity of those trees.\" In Vedic literatures we find that there is a controlling deity of the water; similarly, there is a controlling deity of the trees. The Pracetäs were engaged in burning all the trees to ashes, and they considered the trees their enemies. To pacify the Pracetäs, the predominating deity of the trees, under the advice of Lord Brahmä, delivered the daughter Märiñä."
