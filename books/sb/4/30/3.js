He is always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of lakñmés, or gopés.\" Because this prayer was offered by Lord Brahmä, we follow him by reciting this prayer. That is the easiest way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The pure devotee never attempts to reach the Supreme Lord directly. The most important way to worship the Lord is to go through the disciplic succession of devotees. The prayers offered by Lord Çiva to the Supreme Personality of Godhead were thus repeated by the Pracetäs, who were thus very successful in pleasing the Supreme Lord."

            "content": "Here the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as puraïjana. According to Madhväcärya, the living entity is called puraïjana because he has become an inhabitant of this material world, and under the influence of the three modes of material nature, he is forced to live within it. The Supreme Personality of Godhead creates this material world (pura), and He also enters within it. Aëòäntara-stha-paramäëu-cayäntara-stham (BS 5.35). The Lord enters within the heart of the living entity and within the atom; therefore both the living entity and the Lord are called puraïjana. One puraïjana, the living entity, is subordinate to the supreme puraïjana; therefore the duty of the subordinate puraïjana is to satisfy the supreme puraïjana. That is devotional service. Lord Rudra, or Lord Çiva, is the original äcärya of the Vaiñëava sampradäya called the Rudra-sampradäya. Rudra-gétena indicates that under the disciplic succession of Lord Rudra, the Pracetäs achieved spiritual success."
