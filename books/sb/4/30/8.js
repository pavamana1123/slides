            "content": "Since the sons of King Präcénabarhiñat were all united in Kåñëa consciousness, the Lord was very pleased with them. Each and every one of the sons of King Präcénabarhiñat was an individual soul, but they were united in offering transcendental service to the Lord. The unity of the individual souls attempting to satisfy the Supreme Lord or rendering service to the Lord is real unity. In the material world such unity is not possible. Even though people may officially unite, they all have different interests. In the United Nations, for instance, all the nations have their particular national ambitions, and consequently they cannot be united. Disunity between individual souls is so strong within this material world that even in a society of Kåñëa consciousness, members sometimes appear disunited due to their having different opinions and leaning toward material things. Actually, in Kåñëa consciousness there cannot be two opinions. There is only one goal: to serve Kåñëa to one's best ability. If there is some disagreement over service, such disagreement is to be taken as spiritual. Those who are actually engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be disunited in any circumstance. This makes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very happy and willing to award all kinds of benediction to His devotees, as indicated in this verse. We can see that the Lord is immediately prepared to award all benedictions to the sons of King Präcénabarhiñat."
