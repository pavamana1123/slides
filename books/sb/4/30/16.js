In special instances, however, it is found that a woman has more than one husband. Draupadé, for instance, was married to all of the five Päëòava brothers. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead ordered all the sons of Präcénabarhiñat to marry the one girl born of the great sage Kaëòu and Pramlocä. In special cases, a girl is allowed to marry more than one man, provided she is able to treat her husbands equally. This is not possible for an ordinary woman. Only one who is especially qualified can be allowed to marry more than one husband. In this age of Kali, to find such an equipoised woman is very difficult. Thus according to scripture, kalau païca vivarjayet. In this age a woman is forbidden to marry her husband's brother. This system is still practiced in some of the hilly tracts of India. The Lord says: apåthag-dharma-çéleyaà bhüyät patny arpitäçayä. With the blessings of the Lord, all things are possible. The Lord especially blessed the girl to surrender equally to all brothers. Apåthag-dharma, meaning \"occupational duty without difference of purpose,\" is taught in Bhagavad-gétä. Bhagavad-gétä is divided into three primary divisions-karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga and bhakti-yoga. The word yoga means \"acting on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\" As confirmed by Bhagavad-gétä :"

Different limbs of the body may act in different ways, but the ultimate objective is to maintain the entire body. Similarly, if we work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we will find that we satisfy everything. We should follow in the footsteps of the Pracetäs, whose only aim was to satisfy the Supreme Lord. This is called apåthag-dharma. According to Bhagavad-gétä , sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja: \"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.\" This is the advice of Lord Kåñëa. Our only aim should be to act in Kåñëa consciousness for the satisfaction of the Lord. This is oneness, or apåthag-dharma."
