Lord Näräyaëa is the ultimate goal of sannyäsés, those in the renounced order of life, and Näräyaëa is worshiped through this saìkértana movement by those who are liberated from material contamination. Indeed, they recite the holy name again and again.",

According to the customary etiquette of Mäyävädé sannyäsés, they address one another as Näräyaëa. To say that everyone is a temple of Näräyaëa is correct, but to accept another human being as Näräyaëa is a great offense. The conception of daridra-näräyaëa (poor Näräyaëa), an attempt to identify the poor with Näräyaëa, is also a great offense. Even to identify Näräyaëa with demigods like Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva is an offense."

The goal of those who have renounced the material world is the attainment of Näräyaëa. A Vaiñëava sannyäsé therefore dedicates his life to serving Näräyaëa; he does not falsely claim to be Näräyaëa. Instead of becoming nirvaira (nonenvious of other living entities), one who tries to become Näräyaëa becomes envious of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the attempt to become Näräyaëa constitutes the greatest offense. Actually, when one chants or discusses the transcendental activities of the Lord, he immediately becomes nonenvious. In this material world everyone is envious of everyone else, but by vibrating or discussing the holy name of the Lord, one becomes nonenvious and devoid of material hankering. Because of our envy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we have become envious of all other living entities. When we are no longer envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be real peace, unity and fraternity in human society. Without Näräyaëa or saìkértana-yajïa there cannot be peace in this material world."
