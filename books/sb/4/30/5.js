    "translation": "The Personality of Godhead, appearing on the shoulder of Garuòa, seemed like a cloud resting on the summit of the mountain known as Meru. The transcendental body of the Personality of Godhead was covered by attractive yellow garments, and His neck was decorated with the jewel known as Kaustubha-maëi. The bodily effulgence of the Lord dissipated all the darkness of the universe.",

            "content": "The Lord is just like the effulgent sun. Consequently, whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present, there cannot be darkness or ignorance. Actually this dark universe is illuminated by the sun, but the sun and moon simply reflect the bodily effulgence of the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-gétä  the Lord says, prabhäsmi çaçi-süryayoù: \"I am the illuminating energy of both the sun and the moon.\" The conclusion is that the origin of all life is the bodily effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Brahma-saàhitä: yasya prabhä prabhavato jagad-aëòa-koöi (BS 5.40). Being illuminated by the bodily effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything is freed from all darkness."
