Lord Brahmä, the first creature of the universe, is born from this lotus flower, and subsequently, Lord Brahmä creates the whole universe. The origin of all creation is therefore Lord Viñëu, and the origin of all the viñëu-tattvas is Lord Kåñëa. Consequently, Kåñëa is the origin of everything. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä :"
