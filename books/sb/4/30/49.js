In that one day there are fourteen manvantaras, and out of these manvantaras this Cäkñuña manvantara is the sixth. The various Manus existing in one day of Lord Brahmä are as follows: (1) Sväyambhuva, (2) Svärociña, (3) Uttama, (4) Tämasa, (5) Raivata, (6) Cäkñuña, (7) Vaivasvata, (8) Sävarëi, (9) Dakñasävarëi, (10) Brahma-sävarëi, ( 11) Dharma-sävarëi, (12) Rudra-sävarëi, (13) Deva-sävarëi and (14) Indra-sävarëi."

The present age is under the control of Vaivasvata Manu. Each Manu lives 4,320,000 years multiplied by 71. The present Manu has already lived for 4,320,000 years multiplied by 28. All these long life-spans are ultimately ended by the laws of material nature. The controversy of the Dakña-yajïa took place in the Sväyambhuva manvantara period. As a result, Dakña was punished by Lord Çiva, but by virtue of his prayers to Lord Çiva he became eligible to regain his former opulence. According to Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Dakña underwent severe penances up to the fifth manvantara. Thus at the beginning of the sixth manvantara, known as the Cäkñuña manvantara, Dakña regained his former opulence by the blessings of Lord Çiva."
