    "translation": "Dear Lord, we have studied the Vedas, accepted a spiritual master and offered respect to brähmaëas, advanced devotees and aged personalities who are spiritually very advanced. We have offered our respects to them, and we have not been envious of any brother, friends or anyone else. We have also undergone severe austerities within the water and have not taken food for a long time. All these spiritual assets of ours are simply offered for Your satisfaction. We pray for this benediction only, and nothing more.",

They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy.\" Arjuna, the kñatriya, was refusing to fight despite being directly ordered by the Supreme Lord. He was thus chastised by the Lord as belonging to a non-Äryan family. Anyone who is advanced in the devotional service of the Lord certainly knows his duty. It does not matter whether his duty is violent or nonviolent. If it is sanctioned and ordered by the Supreme Lord, it must be performed. An Äryan performs his duty. It is not that the Äryans are unnecessarily inimical to living entities. The Äryans never maintain slaughterhouses, and they are never enemies of poor animals. The Pracetäs underwent severe austerities for many, many years, even within the water. Accepting austerities and penances is the avowed business of those interested in advanced civilization."
