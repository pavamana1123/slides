    "translation": "Dear Lord, we conditioned souls are always covered by ignorance in the bodily conception of life. We therefore always prefer the miserable conditions of material existence. To deliver us from these miserable conditions, You have advented Yourself in this transcendental form. This is evidence of Your unlimited causeless mercy upon those of us who are suffering in this way. What, then, to speak of the devotees to whom You are always so favorably disposed?",

It is said that all the living entities who died on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra attained their original constitutional position (svarüpa) because they had the chance to see Kåñëa face to face riding in the chariot of Arjuna. On the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, superficially two things were going on—the demons were being killed, and the devotee, Arjuna, was being protected. However, the results were the same for everyone. Thus it is said that the appearance of the Lord diminishes all kinds of miserable conditions caused by material existence."

The Lord shows all mercy not only to conditioned souls but also to the devotees, who are already liberated due to their devotional service."

            "content": "The form of the Lord as worshiped in the temples is called arca-vigraha or arcävatära, the worshipable form, the Deity incarnation. This facility is offered to neophyte devotees so that they can see the real form of the Lord face to face and offer their respectful obeisances and sacrifices in the form of arcä. Through such facilities the neophytes gradually invoke their original Kåñëa consciousness. Deity worship in the form of temple worship is the most valuable benediction given by the Lord to beginners. All neophytes must therefore engage in the worship of the Lord by keeping the arcä-vigraha (arcävatära) at home or in the temple."
