It is suggested that the son's name will be Viçruta and that he will glorify both his father and mother because of his good character. In fact, he would be greater than Lord Brahmä. The great politician Cäëakya said that if there is a good tree within a garden or forest, its flowers will fill the forest with their fragrance. Similarly, a good son within a family makes the whole family famous all over the world. Kåñëa took birth in the family of the Yadus, and consequently the Yadu dynasty is famous all over the world."
