Such a devotee is always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He chants the mahä-mantra as taught by many äcäryas and sometimes goes out for preaching work. The goñöhänandé is one who desires to increase the number of devotees all over the world. He travels all over the world just to purify the world and the people residing in it.

Närada Muni is always wandering throughout the universe just to create different types of devotees. Närada even made a hunter a devotee. He also made Dhruva Mahäräja and Prahläda devotees. Actually, all devotees are indebted to the great sage Närada, for he has wandered both in heaven and in hell. A devotee of the Lord is not even afraid of hell. He goes to preach the glories of the Lord everywhere—even in hell—because there is no distinction between heaven and hell for a devotee."

They take their baths in the waters of the Ganges and Yamunä at places such as Prayäga, Våndävana and Mathurä. In this way the sinful men are purified, but their sinful actions and reactions remain at the holy places of pilgrimage. When a devotee comes to take his bath at those places of pilgrimage, the sinful reactions left by the sinful men are neutralized by the devotee. Térthé-kurvanti térthäni sväntaù-sthena gadä-bhåtä . Because the devotee always carries the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, wherever he goes becomes a place of pilgrimage, a holy place for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is therefore the duty of everyone to associate with a pure devotee and thus attain freedom from material contamination. Everyone should take advantage of the wandering devotees, whose only business is to deliver conditioned souls from the clutches of mäyä."
