Advanced devotees can control their senses; therefore a devotee can be addressed as räjan. A king controls and rules in various ways among citizens; similarly, one who can control his senses is the king of his senses. He is a svämé or gosvämé. The svämés and gosvämés are therefore sometimes addressed as mahäräja, or king."
