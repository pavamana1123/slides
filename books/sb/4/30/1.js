These sons went beside a great lake, which was like an ocean, and fortunately finding Lord Çiva, they learned how to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by chanting the songs composed by Lord Çiva. Now their father's attachment for fruitive activities was disapproved by Närada, who therefore kindly instructed Präcénabarhi by telling him the allegorical story of Puraïjana. Now Vidura again wanted to hear about Präcénabarhi's sons, and he was especially inquisitive to know what they achieved by satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here the words siddhim äpuù, or \"achieved perfection,\" are very important. Lord Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä :"

            "content": "\"After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogés in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.\" And what is that highest perfection? That is also explained in that verse. The highest perfection is to return home, back to Godhead, so that one will not have to return to this material world and transmigrate from one body to another in the dream of material existence. By the grace of Lord Çiva, the Pracetäs actually attained perfection and returned home, back to Godhead, after enjoying material facilities to the highest extent. Maitreya will now narrate that to Vidura."
