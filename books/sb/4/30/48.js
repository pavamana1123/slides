    "translation": "Following the order of Lord Brahmä, all the Pracetäs accepted the girl as their wife. From the womb of this girl, the son of Lord Brahmä named Dakña took birth. Dakña had to take birth from the womb of Märiñä due to his disobeying and disrespecting Lord Mahädeva [Çiva]. Consequently he had to give up his body twice.",

            "content": "In this connection the word mahad-avajïänät is significant. King Dakña was the son of Lord Brahmä; therefore in a previous birth he was a brähmaëa, but because of his behaving like a non-brähmaëa (abrähmaëa) by insulting or disrespecting Lord Mahädeva, he had to take birth within the semen of a kñatriya. That is to say, he became the son of the Pracetäs. Not only that, but because of his disrespecting Lord Çiva, he had to undergo the tribulation of taking birth from within the womb of a woman. In the Dakña-yajïa arena, he was once killed by Lord Çiva's servant, Vérabhadra. Because that was not sufficient, he again took birth, from the womb of Märiñä. At the end of the Dakña-yajïa and the disastrous incidents there, Dakña offered his prayer to Lord Çiva. Although he had to give up his body and take birth from the womb of a woman impregnated by the semen of a kñatriya, he received all opulence by the grace of Lord Çiva. These are the subtle laws of material nature. Unfortunately, people in this modern age do not know how these laws are working. Having no knowledge of the eternity of the spirit soul and its transmigration, the population of the present age is in the greatest ignorance. Because of this, it is said in Bhägavatam : mandäù sumanda-matayo manda-bhägyä hy upadrutäù. The total population in this age of Kali-yuga is very bad, lazy, unfortunate and disturbed by material conditions."
