    "translation": "My dear Bärhaspatya, what did the sons of King Barhiñat, known as the Pracetäs, obtain after meeting Lord Çiva, who is very dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the bestower of liberation? Certainly they were transferred to the spiritual world, but apart from that, what did they obtain within this material world, either in this life or in other lives?",

            "content": "Actually, Lord Mahädeva (Çiva) is one of the great demigods within this material world. Generally his blessings bestowed on ordinary people mean material happiness. The predominating deity of this material world, Durgä, is under the control of Lord Mahädeva, Giriça. Thus Lord Mahädeva can offer anyone any kind of material happiness. Generally people prefer to become devotees of Lord Giriça to obtain material happiness, but the Pracetäs met Lord Mahädeva by providential arrangement. Lord Mahädeva instructed them to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he personally offered a prayer. As stated in the previous verse (rudra-gétena), simply by chanting the prayers offered by Lord Çiva to Viñëu, the Pracetäs were transferred to the spiritual world. Sometimes devotees desire to enjoy material happiness also; therefore, by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the devotee is given a chance to enjoy the material world before his final entrance into the spiritual world. Sometimes a devotee is transferred to a heavenly planet—to Janaloka, Maharloka, Tapoloka, Siddhaloka and so on. However, a pure devotee never aspires for any kind of material happiness. The pure devotee is consequently transferred directly to Vaikuëöhaloka, which is described here as param. In this verse Vidura asks Maitreya, the disciple of Båhaspati, about the different achievements of the Pracetäs."
