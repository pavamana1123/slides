Dhruva Mahäräja practiced severe austerities and penances to see the Supreme Lord, and his intention was to receive benediction from the Lord. He wanted to acquire the throne of his father—or attain an even better position—but when he was actually in the presence of the Supreme Lord, he forgot everything. He said, \"My dear Lord, I do not wish to ask any benediction.\" This is the actual position of the devotee. The devotee simply wants to be in the presence of the Supreme Lord—either in this world or in the next—and engage in His service. That is the ultimate goal and benediction for the devotees."

            "content": "The Lord asked the Pracetäs to pray for some benediction, and they said, \"What kind of benediction should we pray for? The Lord is unlimited, and there are unlimited benedictions.\" The purport is that if one must ask for benediction, he must ask for unlimited benediction. The words tvat parataù are very significant in this verse. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is parataù parät. The word para means \"transcendental, beyond this material world.\" The impersonal Brahman effulgence is beyond this material world, and this is called paraà padam. Äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padam . The Absolute Truth is realized first as impersonal Brahman, then as Paramätmä, and finally as Bhagavän. Thus the Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän, is parataù parät, beyond Brahman and Paramätmä realization. In this connection, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé points out that parataù parät means \"better than the best.\" The best is the spiritual world, and it is known as Brahman. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is known as Parabrahman. Therefore parataù parät means \"better than Brahman realization.\""

The Lord's pastimes, qualities, forms and names are all unlimited. There is no limit to His name, forms, pastimes, creation and paraphernalia. The living entity cannot conceive of the unlimitedness of the unlimited. However, if living entities are engaged in hearing about the unlimited potencies of the Supreme Lord, they are factually connected directly to the unlimited. Such understanding of the unlimited becomes unlimited by hearing and chanting."
