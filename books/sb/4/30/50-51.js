    "translation": "After being born, Dakña, by the superexcellence of his bodily luster, covered all others' bodily opulence. Because he was very expert in performing fruitive activity, he was called by the name Dakña, meaning \"the very expert.\" Lord Brahmä therefore engaged Dakña in the work of generating living entities and maintaining them. In due course of time, Dakña also engaged other Prajäpatis (progenitors) in the process of generation and maintenance.",
