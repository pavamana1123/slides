    "translation": "Dear Lord, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You because Your existence is completely independent of all material influences. Your Lordship always takes away the devotee's miserable conditions, for Your brain plans how to do so. You live everywhere as Paramätmä; therefore You are known as Väsudeva. You also accept Vasudeva as Your father, and You are celebrated by the name Kåñëa. You are so kind that You always increase the influence of all kinds of devotees.",

The three predominating deities of the material universe (Brahmä, Viñëu and Çiva) are called guëa-avatäras. There are many kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the first incarnations within this material world are Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara (Çiva). Out of these three, Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva accept material bodies, but Lord Viñëu does not accept a material body. Lord Viñëu is therefore known as viçuddha-sattva. His existence is completely free from the contamination of the material modes of nature. One should therefore not think that Lord Viñëu is in the same category with Lord Brahmä and Çiva. The çästras forbid us to think in this way."

Therefore in this verse Lord Viñëu is distinguished in the words namo viçuddha-sattväya. Although a living entity like us, Lord Brahmä is exalted due to his pious activities; therefore he is given the high post of Brahmä. Lord Çiva is not actually like a living entity, but he is not the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His position is somewhere between Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Brahmä, the living entity. Lord Çiva is therefore explained in Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38) in this way:"
