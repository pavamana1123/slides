            "content": "Whenever a great sage undergoes severe austerities for material power, the King of heaven, Indra, becomes very envious. All the demigods have responsible posts for the management of universal affairs and are very highly qualified with pious activities. Although they are ordinary living entities, they are able to attain responsible posts, like Lord Brahmä, Indra, Candra and Varuëa. As is the nature of this material world, the King of heaven, Indra, is very anxious if a great sage undergoes severe austerities. The whole material world is filled with such envy that everyone becomes afraid of his neighbors. Every businessman is afraid of his associates because this material world is the field of activities for all kinds of envious people who have come here to compete with the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Indra was very much afraid of the severe austerities performed by the great sage Kaëòu, and he sent Pramlocä to break his vows and austerities. A similar incident took place in the case of Viçvämitra. From other incidents in the çästras, it appears that Indra has always been envious. When King Påthu was celebrating various sacrifices, outdoing Indra, Indra became very envious, and he disturbed King Påthu's sacrifice. This has already been discussed in previous chapters. King Indra became successful in breaking the vow of the great sage Kaëòu, who became attracted by the beauty of the heavenly society girl Pramlocä and begot a female child. This child is described herein as lotus-eyed and very beautiful. Being thus successful in her mission, Pramlocä returned to the heavenly planets, leaving the newborn child to the care of the trees. Fortunately, the trees accepted the child and agreed to raise her."
