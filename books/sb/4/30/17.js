            "content": "The duration of life prescribed for the Pracetäs by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is calculated by the time measurements of higher planetary systems. Our six earth months are said to equal twelve hours in the higher planetary systems. Thirty days equal one month, and twelve months equal one year. In this way, for one million years according to the calculations of the higher planetary system the Pracetäs were allowed to enjoy all kinds of material facilities. Although this life-span was so long, the Pracetäs were given full bodily strength by the grace of the Lord. In the material world, if one wants to live for many years, he must endure the difficulties of old age, invalidity and many other miserable conditions. The Pracetäs, however, were given full bodily strength to enjoy material facilities. This special facility was given to the Pracetäs so that they could continue rendering full devotional service. This will be explained in the following verse."
