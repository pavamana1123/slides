            "content": "One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know that the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this verse it is indicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetäs, the sons of King Präcénabarhiñat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King Präcénabarhiñat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is the way of the paramparä system. If we follow the äcäryas, we attain the same benefit as our predecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly hearing Bhagavad-gétä from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference between hearing Bhagavad-gétä directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like Arjuna, who formerly heard Bhagavad-gétä directly from the Lord. Sometimes foolish people argue that since Kåñëa is not present at the moment, one cannot take direct instructions from Him. Such foolish people do not know that there is no difference between directly hearing Bhagavad-gétä and reading it, as long as one accepts Bhagavad-gétä as it is, spoken by the Lord. However, if one wants to understand Bhagavad-gétä by his imperfect interpretations, one cannot possibly understand the mysteries of Bhagavad-gétä, even though one may be a great scholar according to mundane estimation."
