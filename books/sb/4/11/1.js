As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä , mäm eva ye prapadyante mäyäm etäà taranti te. Without Näräyaëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no one is able to overcome the action of the illusory energy. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has also given us a nice weapon for this age, as stated in the Bhägavatam: säìgopäìgästra—in this age, the näräyaëästra, or weapon to drive away mäyä, is the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra in pursuance of the associates of Lord Caitanya, such as Advaita Prabhu, Nityänanda, Gadädhara and Çréväsa."
