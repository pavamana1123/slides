In the Bhagavad-gétä it is also confirmed, prakåteù kriyamäëäni: ). In the Ninth Chapter, Kåñëa says, \"Under My superintendence material nature is acting.\" Sväyambhuva Manu wanted to impress on Dhruva Mahäräja that the death of the material body of his brother was not actually the Yakñas' fault; it was an act of the material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has immense varieties of potencies, and they act in different gross and subtle ways."

            "content": "It is by such powerful potencies that the universe is created, although grossly it appears to be no more than the five elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether. Similarly, the bodies of all species of living entities, whether human beings or demigods, animals or birds, are also created by the same five elements, and by sexual union they expand into more and more living entities. That is the way of creation, maintenance and annihilation. One should not be disturbed by the waves of material nature in this process. Dhruva Mahäräja was indirectly advised not to be afflicted by the death of his brother because our relationship with the body is completely material. The real self, spirit soul, is never annihilated or killed by anyone."
