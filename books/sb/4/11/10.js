A saintly person is he who follows the path of rendering service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Håñékeça. In the Närada-païcarätra it is said, håñékeëa håñékeça-sevanaà bhaktir ucyate:  the process of rendering favorable service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead with one's senses is called bhakti, or devotional service. Therefore, why should a person who is already engaged in the service of the Lord engage himself in personal sense gratification? Dhruva Mahäräja is advised here by Lord Manu that he is a pure servitor of the Lord. Why should he unnecessarily engage, like the animals, in the bodily concept of life? An animal thinks that the body of another animal is his food; therefore, in the bodily concept of life, one animal attacks another. A human being, especially one who is a devotee of the Lord, should not act like this. A sädhu, a saintly devotee, is not supposed to kill animals unnecessarily."
