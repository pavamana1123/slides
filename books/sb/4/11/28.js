    "translation": "My dear Dhruva, at the age of only five years you were very grievously afflicted by the words of your mother's co-wife, and you very boldly gave up the protection of your mother and went to the forest to engage in the yogic process for realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As a result of this you have already achieved the topmost position in all the three worlds.",

Factually, Dhruva Mahäräja is the glory of the Manu dynasty, or the human family. The human family begins from Manu. The Sanskrit word for man is manuñya, which means \"descendant of Manu.\" Not only is Dhruva Mahäräja the glory of the family of Sväyambhuva Manu, but he is the glory of the entire human society. Because Dhruva Mahäräja had already surrendered to the Supreme Godhead, he was especially requested not to do anything unbefitting a surrendered soul."
