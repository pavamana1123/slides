Actually only one of the citizens, not all of them, was guilty of killing his brother, Uttama. Dhruva Mahäräja, of course, took a very serious step when his brother was killed by the Yakñas. War was declared, and the fighting was going on. This sometimes happens in present days also—for one man's fault a whole state is sometimes attacked. This kind of wholesale attack is not approved by Manu, the father and lawgiver of the human race. He therefore wanted to stop his grandson Dhruva from continuing to kill the Yakña citizens who were not offenders."
