Kåñëa consciousness and mäyä are always there, side by side. As soon as there is awakening of Kåñëa consciousness, all the illusory pains and pleasures of material existence are vanquished. Mäyäm etäà taranti te:  constant chanting of the mahä-mantra will keep us always aloof from the illusory energy of mäyä."
