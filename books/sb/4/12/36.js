    "translation": "The self-effulgent Vaikuëöha planets, by whose illumination alone all the illuminating planets within this material world give off reflected light, cannot be reached by those who are not merciful to other living entities. Only persons who constantly engage in welfare activities for other living entities can reach the Vaikuëöha planets.",

            "content": "Here is a description of two aspects of the Vaikuëöha planets. The first is that in the Vaikuëöha sky there is no need of the sun and moon. This is confirmed by the Upaniñads as well as Bhagavad-gétä (na tad bhäsayate süryo na çaçäìko na pävakaù ). In the spiritual world the Vaikuëöhalokas are themselves illuminated; there is therefore no need of sun, moon or electric light. It is in fact the illumination of the Vaikuëöhalokas which is reflected in the material sky. Only by this reflection are the suns in the material universes illuminated; after the illumination of the sun, all the stars and moons are illuminated. In other words, all the luminaries in the material sky borrow illumination from Vaikuëöhaloka. From this material world, however, people can be transferred to the Vaikuëöhaloka, if they incessantly engage in welfare activities for all other living entities. Such incessant welfare activities can really be performed only in Kåñëa consciousness. There is no philanthropic work within this material world but Kåñëa consciousness that can engage a person twenty-four hours a day."

            "content": "A Kåñëa conscious being is always engaged in planning how to take all of suffering humanity back home, back to Godhead. Even if one is not successful in reclaiming all the fallen souls back to Godhead, still, because he is Kåñëa conscious, his path to Vaikuëöhaloka is open. He personally becomes qualified to enter the Vaikuëöhalokas, and if anyone follows such a devotee, he also enters into Vaikuëöhaloka. Others, who engage in envious activities, are known as karmés. Karmés are envious of one another. Simply for sense gratification, they can kill thousands of innocent animals. Jïänés are not as sinful as karmés, but they do not try to reclaim others back to Godhead. They perform austerities for their own liberation. Yogés are also engaged in self-aggrandizement by trying to attain mystic powers. But devotees, Vaiñëavas, who are servants of the Lord, come forward in the actual field of work in Kåñëa consciousness to reclaim fallen souls. Only Kåñëa conscious persons are eligible to enter into the spiritual world. That is clearly stated in this verse and is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä, wherein the Lord says that there is no one dearer to Him than those who preach the gospel of Bhagavad-gétä to the world."
