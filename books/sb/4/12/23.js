Any five-year-old child can be trained, and within a very short time his life will become successful by realization of Kåñëa consciousness. Unfortunately, this training is lacking all over the world. It is necessary for the leaders of the Kåñëa consciousness movement to start educational institutions in different parts of the world to train children, starting at the age of five years. Thus such children will not become hippies or spoiled children of society; rather, they can all become devotees of the Lord. The face of the world will then change automatically."
