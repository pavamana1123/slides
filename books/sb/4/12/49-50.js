    "translation": "Persons who have completely taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord should recite this narration of Dhruva Mahäräja without taking remuneration. Specifically, recitation is recommended on the full moon or dark moon day, on the day after Ekädaçé, on the appearance of the Çravaëa star, at the end of a particular tithi, or the occasion of Vyatépäta, at the end of the month, or on Sunday. Such recitation should of course be performed before a favorable audience. When recitation is performed this way, without professional motive, the reciter and audience become perfect.",

            "content": "Professional reciters may ask money to extinguish the blazing fire within their bellies, but they cannot make any spiritual improvement or become perfect. It is therefore strictly forbidden to recite Çrémad-Bhägavatam as a profession to earn a livelihood. Only one who is completely surrendered at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, depending fully on Him for personal maintenance or even for maintenance of his family, can attain perfection by recitation of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, which is full of narrations of the pastimes of the Lord and His devotees. The process can be summarized as follows: the audience must be faithfully receptive to the Bhägavata message, and the reciter should completely depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhägavata recitation must not be a business. If done in the right way, not only does the reciter achieve perfect satisfaction, but the Lord also is very satisfied with the reciter and the audience, and thus both are liberated from material bondage simply by the process of hearing."
