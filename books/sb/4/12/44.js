Whether we hear the pastimes and activities of the Supreme Lord or we hear about the character, reputation and activities of His devotees, they are all one and the same. Neophyte devotees simply try to understand the pastimes of the Lord and are not very interested in hearing about the activities of His devotees, but such discrimination should not be indulged in by any real devotee. Sometimes less intelligent men try to hear about the räsa dance of Kåñëa and do not take care to hear about other portions of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, which they completely avoid. There are professional Bhägavata reciters who abruptly go to the räsa-lélä chapters of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, as if other portions of Çrémad-Bhägavatam were useless. This kind of discrimination and abrupt adoption of the räsa-lélä pastimes of the Lord is not approved by the äcäryas. A sincere devotee should read every chapter and every word of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, for the beginning verses describe that it is the ripened fruit of all Vedic literature. Devotees should not try to avoid even a word of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The great sage Maitreya therefore affirmed herein that the Bhägavatam is sammataà satäm, approved by great devotees."
