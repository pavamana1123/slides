A kñatriya or brähmaëa has to take training. A boy born in the family of a brähmaëa is not immediately a brähmaëa; he has to take up the training and the purificatory process."

            "content": "The great sage Närada Muni was very proud of having a devotee-disciple like Dhruva Mahäräja. He had many other disciples, but he was very pleased with Dhruva Mahäräja because in one lifetime, by dint of his severe penances and austerities, he had achieved Vaikuëöha, which was never achieved by any other king's son or räjarñi throughout the whole universe. There is the instance of the great King Bharata, who was also a great devotee, but he attained Vaikuëöhaloka in three lives. In the first life, although he executed austerities in the forest, he became a victim of too much affection for a small deer, and in his next life he had to take birth as a deer. Although he had a deer's body, he remembered his spiritual position, but he still had to wait until the next life for perfection. In the next life he took birth as Jaòa Bharata. Of course, in that life he was completely freed from all material entanglement, and he attained perfection and was elevated to Vaikuëöhaloka. The lesson from the life of Dhruva Mahäräja is that if one likes, one can attain Vaikuëöhaloka in one life, without waiting for many other lives. My Guru Mahäräja, Çré Çrémad Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Gosvämé Prabhupäda, used to say that every one of his disciples could attain Vaikuëöhaloka in this life, without waiting for another life to execute devotional service. One simply has to become as serious and sincere as Dhruva Mahäräja; then it is quite possible to attain Vaikuëöhaloka and go back home, back to Godhead, in one life."
