From a statement in Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is understood that even the sun travels sixteen thousand miles in a second, and from Brahma-saàhitä we understand from the çloka, yac-cakñur eña savitä sakala-grahäëäm that the sun is considered to be the eye of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, and it also has a specific orbit within which it circles. Similarly, all other planets have their specific orbits. But together all of them encircle the polestar, or Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva Mahäräja is situated at the summit of the three worlds. We can only imagine how highly exalted the actual position of a devotee is, and certainly we cannot even conceive how exalted is the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
