Çiçumära or Dhruvaloka can never be reached by anyone but the Vaiñëavas, as will be described by the following çlokas. The associates of Lord Viñëu brought the special airplane for Dhruva Mahäräja and then informed him that Lord Viñëu had especially sent this airplane."

            "content": "The Vaikuëöha airplane does not move by mechanical arrangement. There are three processes for moving in outer space. One of the processes is known to the modern scientist. It is called ka-pota-väyu. Ka means \"outer space,\" and pota means \"ship.\" There is a second process also called kapota-väyu. Kapota means \"pigeon.\" One can train pigeons to carry one into outer space. The third process is very subtle. It is called äkäça-patana. This äkäça-patana system is also material. Just as the mind can fly anywhere one likes without mechanical arrangement, so the äkäça-patana airplane can fly at the speed of mind. Beyond this äkäça-patana system is the Vaikuëöha process, which is completely spiritual. The airplane sent by Lord Viñëu to carry Dhruva Mahäräja to Çiçumära was a completely spiritual, transcendental airplane. Material scientists can neither see such vehicles nor imagine how they fly in the air. The material scientist has no information about the spiritual sky, although it is mentioned in the Bhagavad-gétä (paras tasmät tu bhävo 'nyaù )."
