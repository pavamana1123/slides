    "translation": "Dhruva Mahäräja saw two very beautiful associates of Lord Viñëu in the plane. They had four hands and a blackish bodily luster, they were very youthful, and their eyes were just like reddish lotus flowers. They held clubs in their hands, and they were dressed in very attractive garments with helmets and were decorated with necklaces, bracelets and earrings.",

In this verse it is distinctly stated that they had four hands and were nicely dressed; the description of their bodily decorations corresponds exactly to that of Viñëu. So the two uncommon personalities who descended from the airplane came directly from Viñëuloka, or the planet where Lord Viñëu lives."
