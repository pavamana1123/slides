Kuvera, however, assured him that factually he had not killed any of the Yakñas; therefore, he was not at all sinful. He did his duty as a king, as it is ordered by the laws of nature. \"Nor should you think that your brother was killed by the Yakñas,\" said Kuvera. \"He died or was killed in due course of time by the laws of nature. Eternal time, one of the features of the Lord, is ultimately responsible for annihilation and generation. You are not responsible for such actions.\""
