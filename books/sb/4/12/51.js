Those who out of transcendental kindness take on the responsibility of becoming master-protectors of the poor living entities automatically gain the interest and blessings of the demigods.",

Materialists are very proud of their advancement in education, in philosophical speculation and in scientific knowledge, but no one actually knows what the Absolute Truth is. The great sage Maitreya, therefore, recommends that to enlighten people about the Absolute Truth (tattva), devotees should preach the teachings of Çrémad-Bhägavatam throughout the entire world. Çréla Vyäsadeva especially compiled this great literature of scientific knowledge because people are completely unaware of the Absolute Truth. In the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, First Canto, it is said that Vyäsadeva, the learned sage, compiled this great Bhägavata Puräëa just to stop the ignorance of the mass of people. Because people do not know the Absolute Truth, this Çrémad-Bhägavatam was specifically compiled by Vyäsadeva under the instruction of Närada. Generally, even though people are interested in understanding the truth, they take to speculation and reach at most the conception of impersonal Brahman. But very few men actually know the Personality of Godhead."

            "content": "Recitation of Çrémad-Bhägavatam is specifically meant to enlighten people about the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although there is no fundamental difference between impersonal Brahman, localized Paramätmä and the Supreme Person, factual immortality cannot be obtained unless and until one attains the stage of associating with the Supreme Person. Devotional service, which leads to the association of the Supreme Lord, is actual immortality. Pure devotees, out of compassion for the fallen souls, are kåpälu, very kind to people in general; they distribute this Bhägavata knowledge all over the world. A kindhearted devotee is called déna-nätha, protector of the poor, ignorant mass of people. Lord Kåñëa is also known as déna-nätha or déna-bandhu, the master or actual friend of the poor living entities, and His pure devotee also takes the same position of déna-nätha. The déna-näthas, or devotees of Lord Kåñëa, who preach the path of devotional service, become the favorites of the demigods. Generally people are interested in worshiping the demigods, especially Lord Çiva, in order to obtain material benefits, but a pure devotee, who engages in preaching the principles of devotional service, as prescribed in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, does not need to separately worship the demigods; the demigods are automatically pleased with him and offer all the blessings within their capacity. As by watering the root of a tree the leaves and branches are automatically watered, so, by executing pure devotional service to the Lord, the branches, twigs and leaves of the Lord, known as demigods, are automatically pleased with the devotee, and they offer all benedictions."
