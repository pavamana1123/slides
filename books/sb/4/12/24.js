This principle stated in the Bhagavad-gétä operated in the case of King Dhruva. Throughout his life he tried to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by austerity and penances. Now, the mature result was that Dhruva Mahäräja became fit to be carried to the spiritual world, accompanied by the confidential associates of the Lord."
