    "translation": "Dhruva Mahäräja, seeing that these uncommon personalities were direct servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, immediately stood up. But, being puzzled, in hastiness he forgot how to receive them in the proper way. Therefore he simply offered obeisances with folded hands and chanted and glorified the holy names of the Lord.",

When Dhruva Mahäräja saw the Viñëudütas, the direct associates of Lord Viñëu, four-handed and nicely decorated, he could understand who they were, but for the time being he was puzzled. But simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, the Hare Kåñëa mantra, he could satisfy the uncommon guests who had all of a sudden arrived before him. The chanting of the holy name of the Lord is perfect; even though one does not know how to please Lord Viñëu or His associates, simply by sincerely chanting the holy name of the Lord, everything becomes perfect. A devotee, therefore, either in danger or in happiness, constantly chants the Hare Kåñëa mantra. When he is in danger he is immediately relieved, and when he is in a position to see Lord Viñëu or His associates directly, by chanting this mahä-mantra he can please the Lord. This is the absolute nature of the mahä-mantra. Either in danger or in happiness, it can be chanted without limitation."
