Similarly, by going to the planet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can know all the other planetary systems on the path to Vaikuëöha. We should remember that Dhruva Mahäräja's body was different from our bodies. While boarding the Vaikuëöha airplane, his body changed to a completely spiritual golden hue. No one can surpass the higher planets in a material body, but when one gets a spiritual body he can travel not only to the higher planetary system of this material world, but even to the still higher planetary system known as Vaikuëöhaloka. It is well known that Närada Muni travels everywhere, both in the spiritual and material worlds."

            "content": "It should be noted also that while Sunéti was going to Vaikuëöhaloka she also changed her body into a spiritual form. Like Çré Sunéti, every mother should train her child to become a devotee like Dhruva Mahäräja. Sunéti instructed her son, even at the age of five years, to be unattached to worldly affairs and to go to the forest to search out the Supreme Lord. She never desired that her son remain at home comfortably without ever undertaking austerities and penances to achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Every mother, like Sunéti, must take care of her son and train him to become a brahmacäré from the age of five years and to undergo austerities and penances for spiritual realization. The benefit will be that if her son becomes a strong devotee like Dhruva, certainly not only will he be transferred back home, back to Godhead, but she will also be transferred with him to the spiritual world, even though she may be unable to undergo austerities and penances in executing devotional service."
