            "content": "It is said that only in the association of devotees can one understand the importance of the character and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotees. In this verse it is especially recommended that Dhruva Mahäräja's character be discussed in a society of the twice-born, which refers to the qualified brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas. One should especially seek the society of brähmaëas who are elevated to the position of Vaiñëavas. Thus discussion of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, which describes the character and pastimes of devotees and the Lord, is very quickly effective. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness has been organized for this purpose. In every center of this Society—not only in the morning, evening or noon, but practically twenty-four hours a day—there is continuous devotional service going on. Anyone who comes in contact with the Society automatically becomes a devotee. We have actual experience that many karmés and others come to the Society and find a very pleasing and peaceful atmosphere in the temples of ISKCON. In this verse the word dvi janmanäm means \"of the twice-born.\" Anyone can join the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and be initiated to become twice-born. As recommended by Sanätana Gosvämé, by the process of initiation and authorized training, any man can become twice-born. The first birth is made possible by the parents, and the second birth is made possible by the spiritual father and Vedic knowledge. Unless one is twice-born one cannot understand the transcendental characteristics of the Lord and His devotees. Study of the Vedas is therefore forbidden for çüdras. Simply by academic qualifications a çüdra cannot understand the transcendental science. At the present moment, throughout the entire world the educational system is geared to produce çüdras. A big technologist is no more than a big çüdra. Kalau çüdra-sambhavaù: in the age of Kali, everyone is a çüdra. Because the whole population of the world consists only of çüdras, there is a decline of spiritual knowledge, and people are unhappy. The Kåñëa consciousness movement has been started especially to create qualified brähmaëas to broadcast spiritual knowledge all over the world, for thus people may become very happy."
