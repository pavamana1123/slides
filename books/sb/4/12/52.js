    "translation": "The transcendental activities of Dhruva Mahäräja are well known all over the world, and they are very pure. In childhood Dhruva Mahäräja rejected all kinds of toys and playthings, left the protection of his mother and seriously took shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu. My dear Vidura, I therefore conclude this narration, for I have described to you all its details.",

            "content": "It is said by Cäëakya Paëòita that life is certainly short for everyone, but if one acts properly, his reputation will remain for a generation. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is everlastingly famous, so the reputation of Lord Kåñëa's devotee is also everlasting. Therefore in describing Dhruva Mahäräja's activities two specific words have been used-vikhyäta, very famous, and viçuddha, transcendental. Dhruva Mahäräja's leaving home at a tender age and taking shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the forest is a unique example in this world."
