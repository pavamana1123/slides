    "translation": "The great associates of Vaikuëöhaloka, Nanda and Sunanda, could understand the mind of Dhruva Mahäräja, and thus they showed him that his mother, Sunéti, was going forward in another plane.",

            "content": "This incident proves that the çikñä- or dékñä-guru who has a disciple who strongly executes devotional service like Dhruva Mahäräja can be carried by the disciple even though the instructor is not as advanced. Although Sunéti was an instructor to Dhruva Mahäräja, she could not go to the forest because she was a woman, nor could she execute austerities and penances as Dhruva Mahäräja did. Still, Dhruva Mahäräja was able to take his mother with him. Similarly, Prahläda Mahäräja also delivered his atheistic father, Hiraëyakaçipu. The conclusion is that a disciple or an offspring who is a very strong devotee can carry with him to Vaikuëöhaloka either his father, mother or çikñä- or dékñä-guru. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura used to say, \"If I could perfectly deliver even one soul back home, back to Godhead, I would think my mission—propagating Kåñëa consciousness—to be successful.\" The Kåñëa consciousness movement is spreading now all over the world, and sometimes I think that even though I am crippled in many ways, if one of my disciples becomes as strong as Dhruva Mahäräja, then he will be able to carry me with him to Vaikuëöhaloka."
