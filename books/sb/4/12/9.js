            "content": "Kuvera, who is known as the son of Iòaviòä, was very pleased with Dhruva Mahäräja because he did not ask him for anything materially enjoyable. Kuvera is one of the demigods, so one may put forward the argument, \"Why did Dhruva Mahäräja take a benediction from a demigod?\" The answer is that for a Vaiñëava there is no objection to taking a benediction from a demigod if it is favorable for advancing Kåñëa consciousness. The gopés, for example, worshiped Kätyäyané, a demigoddess, but the only benediction they wanted from the goddess was to have Kåñëa as their husband. A Vaiñëava is not interested in asking any benediction from the demigods, nor is he interested in asking benedictions from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said in the Bhägavatam that liberation can be offered by the Supreme Person, but even if a pure devotee is offered liberation by the Supreme Lord, he refuses to accept it. Dhruva Mahäräja did not ask Kuvera for transference to the spiritual world, which is called liberation; he simply asked that wherever he would remain—whether in the spiritual or material world—he would always remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A Vaiñëava is always respectful to everyone. So when Kuvera offered him a benediction, he did not refuse it. But he wanted something which would be favorable to his advancement in Kåñëa consciousness."
