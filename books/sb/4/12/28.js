    "translation": "The great sage Maitreya continued: Mahäräja Dhruva was very dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When he heard the sweet speeches of the Lord's chief associates in the Vaikuëöha planet, he immediately took his sacred bath, dressed himself with suitable ornaments, and performed his daily spiritual duties. Thereafter he offered his respectful obeisances to the great sages present there and accepted their blessings.",

            "content": "We should mark how dutiful Dhruva Mahäräja was in his devotional service, even at the time he left this material world. He was constantly alert in the performance of devotional duties. Every devotee should take his bath early in the morning and decorate his body with tilaka. In Kali-yuga one can hardly acquire gold or jeweled ornaments, but the twelve tilaka marks on the body are sufficient as auspicious decorations to purify the body. Since Dhruva Mahäräja was living at that time at Badarikäçrama, there were other great sages there. He did not become puffed up because the airplane sent by Lord Viñëu was waiting for him; as a humble Vaiñëava, he accepted blessings from all the sages before riding on the plane brought by the chief of the Vaikuëöha associates."
