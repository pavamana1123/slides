Only such spiritual astronauts can pilot their airplane beyond the seven planets and arrive in the region of eternal blissful life. It is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä also (paras tasmät tu bhävo 'nyaù ) that beyond this planetary system begins the spiritual sky, where everything is permanent and blissful. The planets there are known as Viñëuloka or Vaikuëöhaloka. Only there can one get an eternal blissful life of knowledge. Below Vaikuëöhaloka is the material universe, where Lord Brahmä and others in Brahmaloka can live until the annihilation of this universe; but that life is not permanent. That is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä ( äbrahma-bhuvanäl lokäù). Even if one goes to the topmost planet, one cannot achieve eternal life. Only by arriving in Vaikuëöhaloka can one live an eternally blissful life."
