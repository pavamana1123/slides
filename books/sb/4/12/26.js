    "translation": "Dear King Dhruva, neither your forefathers nor anyone else before you ever achieved such a transcendental planet. The planet known as Viñëuloka, where Lord Viñëu personally resides, is the highest of all. It is worshipable by the inhabitants of all other planets within the universe. Please come with us and live there eternally.",

            "content": "When Dhruva Mahäräja went to perform austerities, he was very determined to achieve a post never dreamed of by his forefathers. His father was Uttänapäda, his grandfather was Manu, and his great-grandfather was Lord Brahmä. So Dhruva wanted a kingdom even greater than Lord Brahmä could achieve, and he requested Närada Muni to give him facility for achieving it. The associates of Lord Viñëu reminded him that not only his forefathers but everyone else before him was unable to attain Viñëuloka, the planet where Lord Viñëu resides. This is because everyone within this material world is either a karmé, a jïäné or a yogé, but there are hardly any pure devotees. The transcendental planet known as Viñëuloka is especially meant for devotees, not for karmés, jïänés or yogés. Great åñis or demigods can hardly approach Brahmaloka, and as stated in Bhagavad-gétä, Brahmaloka is not a permanent residence. Lord Brahmä's duration of life is so long that it is difficult to estimate even the duration of one day in his life, and yet Lord Brahmä also dies, as do the residents of his planet. Bhagavad-gétä  Dhruva Mahäräja was reminded, \"You are going in our company to that planet from which no one returns to this material world.\" Material scientists are attempting to go to the moon and other planets, but they cannot imagine going to the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, for it is beyond their imagination. By material calculation, traveling at the speed of light it would take forty thousand light-years to reach the topmost planet. By mechanical processes we are unable to reach the topmost planet of this universe, but the process called bhakti-yoga, as executed by Mahäräja Dhruva, can give one the facility not only to reach other planets within this universe, but also to reach beyond this universe to the Viñëuloka planets. We have outlined this in our small booklet Easy Journey to Other Planets."
