            "content": "Dhruva had a feeling of obligation to his mother, Sunéti. It was Sunéti who had given him the clue which had now enabled him to be personally carried to the Vaikuëöha planet by the associates of Lord Viñëu. He now remembered her and wanted to take her with him. Actually, Dhruva Mahäräja's mother, Sunéti, was his patha-pradarçaka-guru. Patha-pradarçaka-guru means \"the guru, or the spiritual master, who shows the way.\" Such a guru is sometimes called çikñä-guru. Although Närada Muni was his dékñä-guru (initiating spiritual master), Sunéti, his mother, was the first who gave him instruction on how to achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is the duty of the çikñä-guru or dékñä-guru to instruct the disciple in the right way, and it depends on the disciple to execute the process. According to çästric injunctions, there is no difference between çikñä-guru and dékñä-guru, and generally the çikñä-guru later on becomes the dékñä-guru. Sunéti, however, being a woman, and specifically his mother, could not become Dhruva Mahäräja's dékñä-guru. Still, he was not less obliged to Sunéti. There was no question of carrying Närada Muni to Vaikuëöhaloka, but Dhruva Mahäräja thought of his mother."

            "content": "Whatever plan the Supreme Personality of Godhead contemplates immediately fructifies. Similarly, a devotee who is completely dependent on the Supreme Lord can also fulfill his wishes by the grace of the Lord. The Lord fulfills His wishes independently, but a devotee fulfills his wishes simply by being dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore as soon as Dhruva Mahäräja thought of his poor mother, he was assured by the associates of Viñëu that Sunéti was also going to Vaikuëöhaloka, in another plane. Dhruva Mahäräja had thought that he was going alone to Vaikuëöhaloka, leaving behind his mother, which was not very auspicious because people would criticize him for going alone to Vaikuëöhaloka and not carrying with him Sunéti, who had given him so much. But Dhruva also considered that he was not personally the Supreme. Therefore, if Kåñëa fulfilled his desires, only then would it be possible. Kåñëa could immediately understand his mind, and He told Dhruva that his mother was also going with him. This incident proves that a pure devotee like Dhruva Mahäräja can fulfill all his desires; by the grace of the Lord, he becomes exactly like the Lord, and thus whenever he thinks of anything, his wish is immediately fulfilled."
