    "translation": "All the Siddhas from the higher planetary systems were observing the fight from the sky, and when they saw that Dhruva Mahäräja had been covered by the incessant arrows of the enemy, they roared tumultuously, \"The grandson of Manu, Dhruva, is now lost!\" They cried that Dhruva Mahäräja was just like the sun and that now he had set within the ocean of the Yakñas.",

            "content": "In this verse the word mänava is very significant. Generally this word is used to mean \"human being.\" Dhruva Mahäräja is also described here as mänava. Not only is Dhruva Mahäräja a descendant of Manu, but all human society descends from Manu. According to Vedic civilization, Manu is the lawgiver. Even today Hindus in India follow the laws given by Manu. Everyone, therefore, in human society is a mänava, or descendant from Manu, but Dhruva Mahäräja is a distinguished mänava because he is a great devotee."

            "content": "The denizens of the planet Siddhaloka, where the residents can fly in the sky without airplanes, were anxious over Dhruva Mahäräja's welfare in the battlefield. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé says, therefore, that not only is a devotee well protected by the Supreme Lord, but all the demigods, and even ordinary men, are anxious for his security and safety. The comparison given here that Dhruva Mahäräja appeared to merge in the ocean of the Yakñas is also significant. When the sun sets on the horizon, it appears that the sun drowns in the ocean, but factually the sun has no difficulty. Similarly, although Dhruva appeared to drown in the ocean of the Yakñas, he had no difficulty. As the sun rises again in due course at the end of night, so Dhruva Mahäräja, although he might have been in difficulty (because, after all, it was a fight, and in any fighting activities there are reverses), that did not mean that he was defeated."
