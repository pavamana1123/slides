    "translation": "When the heroes of the Yakñas saw that all their heads were being thus threatened by Dhruva Mahäräja, they could very easily understand their awkward position, and they concluded that they would certainly be defeated. But, as heroes, they lauded the action of Dhruva.",

Dhruva Mahäräja was their enemy, but still, upon witnessing the wonderful, heroic acts of Mahäräja Dhruva, they were very pleased with him. This straightforward appreciation of an enemy's prowess is a characteristic of real kñatriya spirit."
