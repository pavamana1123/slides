    "translation": "All the sages said: Dear Dhruva, O son of King Uttänapäda, may the Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Çärìgadhanvä, who relieves the distresses of His devotees, kill all your threatening enemies. The holy name of the Lord is as powerful as the Lord Himself. Therefore, simply by chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord, many men can be fully protected from fierce death without difficulty. Thus a devotee is saved.",

            "content": "The great åñis approached Dhruva Mahäräja at a time when his mind was very perplexed due to the magical feats exhibited by the Yakñas. A devotee is always protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His inspiration only, the sages came to encourage Dhruva Mahäräja and assure him that there was no danger because he was a soul fully surrendered to the Supreme Lord. By the grace of the Lord, if a devotee, at the time of death, can simply chant His holy name—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—simply by chanting this mahä-mantra, he immediately surpasses the great ocean of the material sky and enters the spiritual sky. He never has to come back for repetition of birth and death. Simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can surpass the ocean of death, so Dhruva Mahäräja was certainly able to surpass the illusory magical feats of the Yakñas, which for the time being disturbed his mind."
