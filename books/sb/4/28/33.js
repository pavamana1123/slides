By executing devotional service, he begot many sons and disciples for propagating the bhakti cult (çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù ). Actually, the entire world should be divided among such disciples. Everyone should be engaged in preaching the cult of Kåñëa consciousness. In other words, when disciples are grown up and are able to preach, the spiritual master should retire and sit down in a solitary place to write and execute nirjana-bhajana. This means sitting silently in a solitary place and executing devotional service. This nirjana-bhajana, which is the silent worship of the Supreme Lord, is not possible for a neophyte devotee. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura never advised a neophyte devotee to go to a solitary place to engage in devotional service. Indeed, he has written a song in this connection:"

Simply for cheap adoration you sit in a solitary place and pretend to chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, but this is all cheating.\" Thus Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura advocated that every devotee, under the guidance of an expert spiritual master, preach the bhakti cult, Kåñëa consciousness, all over the world. Only when one is mature can he sit in a solitary place and retire from preaching all over the world. Following this example, the devotees of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness now render service as preachers in various parts of the world. Now they can allow the spiritual master to retire from active preaching work. In the last stage of the spiritual master's life, the devotees of the spiritual master should take preaching activities into their own hands. In this way the spiritual master can sit down in a solitary place and render nirjana-bhajana."
