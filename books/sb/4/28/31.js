After one such Manu passes on, another Manu begins his life-span. In this way the life cycle of the universe is going on. As one Manu follows another, the cult of Kåñëa consciousness is being imparted, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä :"

In this way the propagation of Kåñëa consciousness is never stopped. No one should think that this Kåñëa consciousness movement is a new movement. As confirmed by Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, it is a very, very old movement, for it has been passing down from one Manu to another."

We can see that under the instructions of Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Gosvämé Mahäräja began preaching the Kåñëa consciousness movement in an organized way within the past hundred years. The disciples of Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Gosvämé Mahäräja are all Godbrothers, and although there are some differences of opinion, and although we are not acting conjointly, every one of us is spreading this Kåñëa consciousness movement according to his own capacity and producing many disciples to spread it all over the world. As far as we are concerned, we have already started the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and many thousands of Europeans and Americans have joined this movement. Indeed, it is spreading like wildfire. The cult of Kåñëa consciousness, based on the nine principles of devotional service (çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù smaraëaà päda-sevanam/ arcanaà vandanaà däsyaà sakhyam ätma-nivedanam ), will never be stopped. It will go on without distinction of caste, creed, color or country. No one can check it."

Just as a king gives protection to his citizens, these devotees, following the principles of devotional service, will give protection to all the people of the world. The people of the world are very much harassed by so-called religious-principled svämés, yogés, karmés and jïänés, but none of these can show the right way to become elevated to the spiritual platform. There are primarily four parties spreading devotional service all over the universe. These are the Rämänuja-sampradäya, the Madhva-sampradäya, the Viñëu Svämé-sampradäya and the Nimbärka-sampradäya. The Madhva-Gauòéya-sampradäya in particular comes from Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu. All these devotees are spreading this Kåñëa consciousness movement very widely and giving protection to innocent people who are being so much embarrassed by pseudo-avatäras, -svämés, -yogés and others."
