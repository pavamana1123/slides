    "translation": "The objects of enjoyment became stale by the influence of Kälakanyä. Due to the continuance of his lusty desires, King Puraïjana became very poor in everything.

Consequently everyone becomes confused at the end of life, not knowing what spiritual life and the goal of human life are. In a civilization of sense gratification there cannot be spiritual life, because a person thinks only of this life. Although the next life is a fact, no information is given about it."
