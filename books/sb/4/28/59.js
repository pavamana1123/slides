Forgetfulness of spiritual existence entangles a man more and more in material existence. Such is the result of sinful life. Various bodies are developed with the material ingredients because of different types of sinful activities. King Puraïjana assumed the body of a woman, Vaidarbhé, as a result of his sinful activities. Bhagavad-gétä clearly says (striyo vaiçyäs tathä çüdräù ) that such a body is lowborn. If one takes shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, he can be elevated to the highest perfection, even though he be lowborn. One acquires lower births when one's spiritual intelligence is reduced."
