In other words, those who are very fond of family life should come forward in the service of the spiritual master and abandon so-called happiness afforded by society, friendship and love. A verse by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura in his Gurv-añöaka is significant in this regard. Yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädaù. A disciple should always remember that by serving the spiritual master he can easily advance in Kåñëa consciousness. All the scriptures recommend that it is by pleasing the spiritual master and serving him directly that one can attain the highest perfectional stage of devotional service."

            "content": "The word madirekñaëä is also significant in this verse. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has explained in his Sandarbha that the word madira means \"intoxicating.\" If one's eyes become intoxicated upon seeing the Deity, he may be called madirekñaëa. Queen Vaidarbhé's eyes were very enchanting, just as one's eyes are madirekñaëa when engaged in seeing the temple Deity. Unless one is an advanced devotee, he cannot fix his eyes on the Deity in the temple."
