The disciple accepts the spiritual master as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated by Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura in Gurv-añöaka, säkñäd-dharitvena: \"One directly accepts the guru, the spiritual master, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\" One should accept the spiritual master not in the sense that the Mäyävädé philosophers do, but in the way recommended here. Since the spiritual master is the most confidential servant of the Lord, he should be treated exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The spiritual master should never be neglected or disobeyed, like an ordinary person."

            "content": "If a woman is fortunate enough to be the wife of a pure devotee, she can serve her husband without any desire for sense gratification. If she remains engaged in the service of her exalted husband, she will automatically attain the spiritual perfections of her husband. If a disciple gets a bona fide spiritual master, simply by satisfying him, he can attain a similar opportunity to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
