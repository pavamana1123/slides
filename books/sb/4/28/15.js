Otherwise at the time of my final breath, when my throat is choked up, how will it be possible for me to think of You?\" The swan takes great pleasure in diving within water and being encircled by the stem of the lotus flower. This entanglement is sporting joy. If, in our healthy condition, we think of the lotus feet of the Lord and die, it is most fortunate. In old age, at the time of death, the throat sometimes becomes choked with mucus or blocked by air. At such a time the sound vibration of Hare Kåñëa, the mahä-mantra, may not come out. Thus one may forget Kåñëa. Of course, those who are strong in Kåñëa consciousness cannot possibly forget Kåñëa at any stage because they are accustomed to chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra, especially when there is a signal from death."
