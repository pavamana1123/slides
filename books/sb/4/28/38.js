Actually, however, Parabrahman, the Supreme Brahman, is Kåñëa, Väsudeva. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä  therefore says, kleço 'dhikataras teñäm avyaktäsakta-cetasäm: \"For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome.\" Consequently, when it is said herein that King Malayadhvaja fixed his mind on Brahman, \"Brahman\" means the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva."
