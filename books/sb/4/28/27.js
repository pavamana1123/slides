Material existence is experienced when one becomes attached to a woman and forgets his real identity as the eternal servant of Kåñëa (nañöa-småtiù). In this way, in one body after another, the living entity perpetually suffers the threefold miseries of material existence. To save human civilization from the darkness of ignorance, this movement was started. The main purpose of the Kåñëa consciousness movement is to enlighten the forgetful living entity and remind him of his original Kåñëa consciousness. In this way the living entity can be saved from the catastrophe of ignorance as well as bodily transmigration. As Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has sung:"

People are always trying to find many ways to mitigate anxiety, but because they are not guided by a real leader, they try to forget material anxiety through drink and sex indulgence. Foolish people do not know that by attempting to escape anxiety by drink and sex, they simply increase their duration of material life. It is not possible to escape material anxiety in this way."

Consequently, in Vedic civilization one is trained from the beginning to give up attachment for women. The first stage of life is brahmacäré, the second stage gåhastha, the third stage vänaprastha, and the fourth stage sannyäsa. All these stages are devised to enable one to detach himself from the association of women."
