    "translation": "King Malayadhvaja attained perfect knowledge by being able to distinguish the Supersoul from the individual soul. The individual soul is localized, whereas the Supersoul is all-pervasive. He became perfect in knowledge that the material body is not the soul but that the soul is the witness of the material body.",

There are two types of Mäyävädé philosophers—the followers of the Buddhist philosophy and the followers of the Çaìkara philosophy. The followers of Buddha do not recognize that there is anything beyond the body; the followers of Çaìkara conclude that there is no separate existence of the Paramätmä, the Supersoul. The Çaìkarites believe that the individual soul is identical with the Paramätmä in the ultimate analysis. But the Vaiñëava philosopher, who is perfect in knowledge, knows that the body is made of the external energy and that the Supersoul, the Paramätmä, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is sitting with the individual soul and is distinct from him. As Lord Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä :"

Yet there is another, who is known as the Supersoul, who, along with the individual soul, simply witnesses. The individual soul works and enjoys the fruits of the body, whereas the Supersoul simply witnesses the activities of the individual soul but does not enjoy the fruits of those activities. The Supersoul is present in every field of activity, whereas the individual soul is present in his one localized body. King Malayadhvaja attained this perfection of knowledge and was able to distinguish between the soul and the Supersoul and the soul and the material body."
