When one comes to the conclusion that Kåñëa is everything by worshiping or by rendering devotional service unto Kåñëa, one actually becomes perfect in all respects. Not only must one come to the conclusion that Kåñëa is everything, but he must remain fixed in this realization. This is the highest perfection of life, and it is this perfection that King Malayadhvaja attained at the end."
