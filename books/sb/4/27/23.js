Although Kälakanyä, the daughter of Time, was refused by Närada Muni, she was given a shelter. Of course no one could give her shelter, but a Vaiñëava gives shelter somewhere to such an unfortunate girl. When jarä, or old age, attacks, everyone dwindles and deteriorates. In one stroke Närada Muni gave shelter to Kälakanyä and counterattacked the ordinary karmés. If one accepts the instructions of Närada Muni, the ocean of fear (bhaya) can be very quickly removed by the grace of that great Vaiñëava."
