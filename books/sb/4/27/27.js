            "content": "Actually the supreme controller is the Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and everyone is His servant. Yavana-räja, the King of the Yavanas, was also a servant of Kåñëa. Consequently, he wanted to execute the purpose of Kåñëa through the agency of Kälakanyä. Although Kälakanyä means invalidity or old age, Yavana-räja wanted to serve Kåñëa by introducing Kälakanyä everywhere. Thus a sane person, by attaining old age, will become fearful of death. Foolish people engage in material activities as if they will live forever and enjoy material advancement, but actually there is no material advancement. Under illusion people think that material opulence will save them, but although there has been much advancement in material science, the problems of human society—birth, death, old age and disease—are still unsolved. Nonetheless foolish scientists are thinking that they have advanced materially. When Kälakanyä, the invalidity of old age, attacks them, they become fearful of death, if they are sane. Those who are insane simply do not care for death, nor do they know what is going to happen after death. They are under the wrong impression that after death there is no life, and consequently they act very irresponsibly in this life and enjoy unrestricted sense gratification. For an intelligent person, the appearance of old age is an impetus to spiritual life. People naturally fear impending death. The King of the Yavanas tried to utilize Kälakanyä for this purpose."
