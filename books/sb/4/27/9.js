The body is the field of activity for the living entity, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä: kñetra-kñetrajïa. There are two constituents: one is the living entity (kñetra jïa), and the other is the body of the living entity (kñetra). Any living entity can know that he is covered by the body if he only contemplates the body a little bit. Just with a little contemplation he can come to understand that the body is his possession. One can understand this by practical experience and by the authority of the çästras. In Bhagavad-gétä  it is said: dehino'smin yathä dehe. The proprietor of the body, the soul, is within the body. The body is taken as the païcäla-deça, or the field of activities wherein the living entity can enjoy the senses in their relationship to the five sense objects, namely gandha, rasa, rüpa, sparça and çabda—that is, sense objects made out of earth, water, fire, air and sky. Within this material world, covered by the material body of subtle and gross matter, every living entity creates actions and reactions, which are herein known allegorically as sons and grandsons. There are two kinds of actions and reactions—namely pious and impious. In this way our material existence becomes coated by different actions and reactions. In this regard, Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura states:"

            "content": "Thus the field of action and reactions, by which one's descendants are increased, begins with sex life. Puraïjana increased his whole family by begetting sons who in their turn begot grandsons. Thus the living entity, being inclined toward sexual gratification, becomes involved in many hundreds and thousands of actions and reactions. In this way he remains within the material world simply for the purpose of sense gratification and transmigrates from one body to another. His process of reproducing so many sons and grandsons results in so-called societies, nations, communities and so on. All these communities, societies, dynasties and nations simply expand from sex life. As stated by Prahläda Mahäräja: yan maithunädi-gåhamedhi-sukhaà hi tuccham  as repeated creation and annihilation: bhütvä bhütvä praléyate. Due to a lack of Kåñëa consciousness, all this creation and annihilation is going on under the name of human civilization. This cycle continues due to man's lack of knowledge of the soul and the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
