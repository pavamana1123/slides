Thus he accepted Kälakanyä in a different way. In other words, the injunctions of Närada Muni, or the path of devotional service, can be accepted by anyone within the three worlds, and certainly by the King of the Yavanas. Lord Caitanya Himself requested everyone to preach the cult of bhakti-yoga all over the world, in every village and town. Preachers in the Kåñëa consciousness movement have actually experienced that even the yavanas and mlecchas have taken to spiritual life on the strength of Närada Muni's päïcarätrika-vidhi. When mankind follows the disciplic succession, as recommended by Caitanya Mahäprabhu, everyone throughout the world will benefit."
