The invalidity of old age can overcome an ordinary man, but Närada Muni was different. Taking Närada Muni to be an ordinary man, the daughter of Time confronted him with her lusty desire. It requires great strength to resist a woman's attraction. It is difficult for old men, and what to speak of young. Those who live as brahmacärés must follow in the footsteps of the great sage Närada Muni, who never accepted the proposals of Jarä. Those who are too much sexually addicted become victims of jarä, and very soon their life-span is shortened. Without utilizing the human form of life for Kåñëa consciousness the victims of jarä die very soon in this world."
