Those who do not follow the Vedic principles are unrestricted as far as sex life is concerned. Consequently they sometimes do not hesitate to have sex with their sisters. In this age of Kali there are many instances of such incest. Although Yavana-räja accepted the request of Närada Muni to show respect to him, he was nonetheless thinking of illicit sex. This was due to his being the King of the yavanas and mlecchas."

            "content": "The word prajväraù is very significant, for it means \"the fever sent by Lord Viñëu.\" Such a fever is always set at 107 degrees, the temperature at which a man dies. Thus the King of the mlecchas and yavanas requested the daughter of Time, Kälakanyä, to become his sister. There was no need to ask her to become his wife, for the yavanas and mlecchas do not make distinctions as far as sex life is concerned. Thus one may outwardly be a sister, mother or daughter and still have sex. Yavana-räja's brother was Prajvära, and Kälakanyä was invalidity itself. Combined and strengthened by the soldiers of Yavana-räja—namely nonhygienic conditions, illicit sex and ultimately a high degree of temperature to bring on death—they would be able to smash the materialistic way of life. In this connection it is significant that Närada was immune to the attack of jarä, or invalidity, and similarly jarä, or the destructive force, cannot attack any follower of Närada Muni or a pure Vaiñëava."
