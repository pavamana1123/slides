Since Kälakanyä, the daughter of Time, was deputed by Närada Muni to offer herself to Yavana-räja, the King of the Yavanas could not refuse her. All transactions must be performed in light of the çästric injunctions. The çästric injunctions are confirmed by great sages like Närada Muni. As stated by Narottama däsa Öhäkura: sädhu-çästra-guru-väkya, cittete kariyä aikya. One should follow the principles of saintly persons, scriptures and the spiritual master. In this way one is sure to attain success in life. Kälakanyä, the daughter of Time, presented herself before the King of the Yavanas precisely in terms of sädhu, çästra and guru. Thus there was no reason for not accepting her."
