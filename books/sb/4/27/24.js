According to the Vedic principles, one should rise early in the morning, take bath, chant Hare Kåñëa, offer maìgala-ärati to the Deities, study Vedic literature, take prasäda and engage in dressing and decorating the Deities. One must also collect money for the temple expenditures, or if one is a householder he must go to work in accordance with the prescribed duties of a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra. In this way one should live a life of spiritual understanding, and this is the Vedic way of civilization. One who does not follow all these rules and regulations is called a yavana or mleccha. One should not mistakenly think that these words refer to certain classes of men in other countries. There is no question of limitation according to nationalism. Whether one lives in India or outside of India, he is called a yavana or mleccha if he does not follow the Vedic principles. One who does not actually follow the hygienic principles prescribed in the Vedic rules and regulations will be subjected to many contagious diseases. Because the students in this Kåñëa consciousness movement are advised to follow the Vedic principles, they naturally become hygienic."

All devotees are in the disciplic succession stemming from Närada Muni because they worship the Deity according to Närada Muni's direction, namely the Närada-païcarätra, or the päïcarätrika-vidhi. A devotee follows the principles of päïcarätrika-vidhi as well as bhägavata-vidhi. Bhägavata-vidhi includes preaching work—çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù —the hearing and chanting of the glories of Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The päïcarätrika-vidhi includes arcanaà vandanaà däsyaà sakhyam ätma-nivedanam. Because a devotee rigidly follows the instructions of Närada Muni, he has no fear of old age, disease or death. Apparently a devotee may grow old, but he is not subjected to the symptoms of defeat experienced by a common man in old age. Consequently, old age does not make a devotee fearful of death, as a common man is fearful of death. When jarä, or old age, takes shelter of a devotee, Kälakanyä diminishes the devotee's fear. A devotee knows that after death he is going back home, back to Godhead; therefore he has no fear of death. Thus instead of depressing a devotee, advanced age helps him become fearless and thus happy."
