    "translation": "The great sage Närada continued: My dear King Präcénabarhiñat, like you King Puraïjana also became implicated in so many desires. Thus he worshiped demigods, forefathers and social leaders with various sacrifices which were all very ghastly because they were inspired by the desire to kill animals.",

            "content": "In this verse the great sage Närada discloses that the character of Puraïjana was being described to give lessons to King Präcénabarhiñat. Actually the entire description was figuratively describing the activities of King Präcénabarhiñat. In this verse Närada frankly says \"like you\" (yathä bhavän), which indicates that King Puraïjana is none other than King Präcénabarhiñat himself. Being a great Vaiñëava, Närada Muni wanted to stop animal-killing in sacrifices. He knew that if he tried to stop the King from performing sacrifices, the King would not hear him. Therefore he is describing the life of Puraïjana. But in this verse he first discloses the intention, although not fully, by saying \"like you.\" Generally the karmés, who are attached to increasing descendants, have to perform so many sacrifices and worship so many demigods for future generations, as well as to satisfy so many leaders, politicians, philosophers and scientists to make things go on properly for future generations. The so-called scientists are very eager to see that future generations will live very comfortably, and as such they are trying to find different means of generating energy to drive locomotives, cars, airplanes and so on. Now they are exhausting the petroleum supply. These activities are described in the Bhagavad-gétä :"

As such they become implicated and take on so many activities. Most of these activities center around the killing of animals. Modern civilization is centered around animal-killing. Karmés are advertising that without eating meat, their vitamin value or vitality will be reduced; so to keep oneself fit to work hard, one must eat meat, and to digest meat, one must drink liquor, and to keep the balance of drinking wine and eating meat, one must have sufficient sexual intercourse to keep fit to work very hard like an ass."

All the religions of the world—except the Buddhists—have a program for killing animals in places of worship. According to Vedic civilization, the animal-eaters are recommended to sacrifice a goat in the temple of Kälé under certain restrictive rules and regulations and eat the flesh. Similarly, they are recommended to drink wine by worshiping the goddess Caëòikä. The purpose is restriction. People have given up all this restriction. Now they are regularly opening wine distilleries and slaughterhouses and indulging in drinking alcohol and eating flesh. A Vaiñëava äcärya like Närada Muni knows very well that persons engaged in such animal-killing in the name of religion are certainly becoming involved in the cycle of birth and death, forgetting the real aim of life: to go home, back to Godhead."

The conclusion is that neither the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, nor His devotee ever sanctions animal-killing in the name of religion. Indeed, Kåñëa incarnated Himself as Lord Buddha to put an end to animal-killing in the name of religion. Animal sacrifice under the name of religion is conducted by the influence of tamo-guëa (the mode of ignorance), as indicated in the Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä :"

At the present moment it is the greatest misfortune that in India many so-called missionary workers are spreading irreligion in the name of religion. They claim an ordinary human being to be God and recommend meat-eating for everyone, including so-called sannyäsés."
