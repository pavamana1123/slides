            "content": "As Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura sings, saba sukha bhägala: all kinds of happiness disappear in old age. Consequently, no one likes old age, or jarä. Thus Jarä, as the daughter of Time, is known as a most unfortunate daughter. She was, however, at one time accepted by a great king, Yayäti. Yayäti was cursed by his father-in-law, Çukräcärya, to accept her. When Çukräcärya's daughter was married to King Yayäti, one of her friends named Çarmiñöhä went with her. Later King Yayäti became very much attached to Çarmiñöhä, and Çukräcärya's daughter complained to her father. Consequently, Çukräcärya cursed King Yayäti to become prematurely old. King Yayäti had five youthful sons, and he begged all his sons to exchange their youth for his old age. No one agreed except the youngest son, whose name was Püru. Upon accepting Yayäti's old age, Püru was given the kingdom. It is said that two of Yayäti's other sons, being disobedient to their father, were given kingdoms outside of India, most probably Turkey and Greece. The purport is that one can accumulate wealth and all kinds of material opulences, but during old age one cannot enjoy them. Although Püru attained his father's kingdom, he could not enjoy all the opulence, for he had sacrificed his youth. One should not wait for old age in order to become Kåñëa conscious. Due to the invalidity of old age, one cannot make progress in Kåñëa consciousness, however opulent he may be materially."
