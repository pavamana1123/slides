In other words, such a person also returns home to the Vaikuëöha planets, back to Godhead.",

This means that bhakti, or devotional service, begins by hearing and chanting about Viñëu. When we speak of Viñëu, we also refer to that which relates to Viñëu. In the Çiva Puräëa, Lord Çiva recommends Viñëu worship to be the topmost worship, and better than Viñëu worship is worship of the Vaiñëava or anything that is related to Viñëu. The fact is explained herein that hearing and chanting about a Vaiñëava is as good as hearing and chanting about Viñëu, for Maitreya has explained that anyone who hears about Påthu Mahäräja with attention also attains the planet which Mahäräja Påthu attained. There is no duality between Viñëu and the Vaiñëava, and this is called advaya-jïäna. A Vaiñëava is as important as Viñëu, and therefore Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura wrote in his Gurv-añöaka:"

            "content": "The supreme Vaiñëava is the spiritual master, and he is nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said that sometimes Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu used to chant the names of the gopés. Some of the Lord's students tried to advise Him to chant the name of Kåñëa instead, but upon hearing this Caitanya Mahäprabhu became very angry with His students. The controversy on this subject reached a point that after this incident Caitanya Mahäprabhu decided to take sannyäsa because He was not taken very seriously in His gåhastha-äçrama. The point is that since Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu chanted the names of the gopés, worship of the gopés or the devotees of the Lord is as good as devotional service rendered directly to the Lord. It is also stated by the Lord Himself that devotional service to His devotees is better than service offered directly to Him. Sometimes the sahajiyä class of devotees are interested only in Kåñëa's personal pastimes to the exclusion of the activities of the devotees. This type of devotee is not on a very high level; one who sees the devotee and the Lord on the same level has further progressed."
