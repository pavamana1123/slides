Such a devotee should know by this instruction that the pastimes of Påthu Mahäräja are nondifferent from the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. An ideal king, Påthu Mahäräja exhibited all talents in showing how to rule the citizens, how to educate them, how to develop the state economically, how to fight enemies, how to perform great sacrifices (yajïas), etc. Thus it is recommended for the sahajiyä, or the neophyte devotee, to hear, chant and get others to hear about the activities of Påthu Mahäräja, even though one may think himself to be in the transcendental position of advanced devotional service."
