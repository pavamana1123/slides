    "translation": "By thus practicing severe austerities, Mahäräja Påthu gradually became steadfast in spiritual life and completely free of all desires for fruitive activities. He also practiced breathing exercises to control his mind and senses, and by such control he became completely free from all desires for fruitive activity.",

The purpose of präëäyäma, or mystic yoga, is to stop the mind and senses from engaging in fruitive activities. The so-called yogés who practice in Western countries have no idea of this. The aim of präëäyäma is not to make the body strong and fit for working hard. The aim is worship of Kåñëa. In the previous verse it was specifically mentioned that whatever austerity, präëäyäma and mystic yoga practices Påthu Mahäräja performed were performed for the sake of worshiping Kåñëa. Thus Påthu Mahäräja serves as a perfect example for yogés also. Whatever he did, he did to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa."

            "content": "The minds of those who are addicted to fruitive activity are always filled with unclean desires. Fruitive activities are symptomatic of our polluted desire to dominate material nature. As long as one continues to be subject to polluted desires, he has to accept one material body after another. So-called yogés, without knowledge of the real purpose of yoga, practice it in order to keep the body fit. Thus they engage themselves in fruitive activities, and thus they are bound by desire to accept another body. They are not aware that the ultimate goal of life is to approach Kåñëa. In order to save such yogés from wandering throughout the different species of life, the çästras warn that in this age such yogic practice is simply a waste of time. The only means of elevation is the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra."

Consequently the çästras enjoin: kalau nästy eva nästy eva nästy eva gatir anyathä. The conclusion is that unless the karmés, jïänés and yogés come to the point of devotional service to Lord Kåñëa, their so-called austerities and yoga have no value. Närädhitaù: if Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is not worshiped, there is no point in practicing meditational yoga, performing karma-yoga or culturing empiric knowledge. As far as präëäyäma is concerned, chanting of the holy name of the Lord and dancing in ecstasy are also considered präëäyäma. In a previous verse, Sanat-kumära instructed Mahäräja Påthu to engage constantly in the service of the Supreme Lord, Väsudeva:"
