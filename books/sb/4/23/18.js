    "translation": "Påthu Mahäräja then offered the total designation of the living entity unto the supreme controller of illusory energy. Being released from all the designations by which the living entity became entrapped, he became free by knowledge and renunciation and by the spiritual force of his devotional service. In this way, being situated in his original constitutional position of Kåñëa consciousness, he gave up this body as a prabhu, or controller of the senses.",

Although the individual living entity (jéva) and the Lord are both situated within the material energy, the Lord is directing the movements of the jéva soul by offering him different types of bodies through the material energy, and thus the living entity is wandering throughout the universes in various forms of body and becomes implicated in different situations, partaking of the reactions of fruitive activities."

            "content": "When Påthu Mahäräja became spiritually powerful by the enhancement of his spiritual knowledge (jïäna) and renunciation of material desires, he became a prabhu, or master of his senses (sometimes called gosvämé or svämé). This means that he was no longer controlled by the influence of material energy. When one is strong enough to give up the influence of material energy, he is called prabhu. In this verse the word svarüpa-sthaù is also very significant. The real identity of the individual soul lies in understanding or attaining the knowledge that he is eternally a servant of Kåñëa. This understanding is called svarüpopalabdhi. By culturing devotional service, the devotee gradually comes to understand his actual relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This understanding of one's pure spiritual position is called svarüpopalabdhi, and when one attains that stage he can understand how he is related with the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a servant or friend or as a parent or conjugal lover. This stage of understanding is called svarüpa-sthaù. Påthu Mahäräja realized this svarüpa completely, and it will be clear in the later verses that he personally left this world, or this body, by riding on a chariot sent from Vaikuëöha."

            "content": "In this verse the word prabhu is also significant. As stated before, when one is completely self-realized and acts according to that position, he can be called prabhu. The spiritual master is addressed as \"Prabhupäda\" because he is a completely self-realized soul. The word päda means \"position,\" and Prabhupäda indicates that he is given the position of prabhu, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for he acts on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unless one is a prabhu, or controller of the senses, he cannot act as spiritual master, who is authorized by the supreme prabhu, or Lord Kåñëa. In his verses praising the spiritual master, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura writes:"

            "content": "\"The spiritual master is honored as much as the Supreme Lord because he is the most confidential servitor of the Lord.\" Thus Påthu Mahäräja can also be called Prabhupäda, or, as described herein, prabhu. Another question may be raised in this connection. Since Påthu Mahäräja was a power incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, çaktyäveça-avatära, why did he have to execute the regulative principles in order to become a prabhu? Because he appeared on this earth as an ideal king and because it is the duty of the king to instruct the citizens in the execution of devotional service, he followed all the regulative principles of devotional service in order to teach others. Similarly, Caitanya Mahäprabhu, although Kåñëa Himself, taught us how to approach Kåñëa as a devotee. It is said, äpani äcari' bhakti çikhäinu sabäre. Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu instructed others in the process of devotional service by setting the example Himself through His own personal actions. Similarly, Påthu Mahäräja, although a çaktyäveça-avatära incarnation, still behaved exactly as a devotee in order to achieve the position of prabhu. Furthermore, svarüpa-sthaù means \"complete liberation.\" As it is said , hitvänyathä-rüpaà svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù: when a living entity abandons the activities of mäyä and attains the position from which he can execute devotional service, his state is called svarüpa-sthaù, or complete liberation."
