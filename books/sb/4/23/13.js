It is thoroughly described in the following verses how one can voluntarily give up this body and return home, back to Godhead. The yogic process practiced by Påthu Mahäräja at the time of death accelerates the giving up of this body while one is in sound health physically and mentally. Every devotee desires to give up the body while it is sound physically and mentally. This desire was also expressed by King Kulaçekhara in his Mukunda-mälä-stotra:"

When a man dies, he is generally overpowered by mucus and bile, and thus he chokes. Since it is very difficult to vibrate any sound while choking, it is simply by Kåñëa's grace that one can chant Hare Kåñëa at the time of death. However, by situating oneself in the muktäsana position, a yogé can immediately give up his body and go to whatever planet he desires. A perfect yogé can give up his body whenever he desires through the practice of yoga."
