The Lord here declares that this material world is full of miseries (asukham) and at the same time is very flickering (anityam). Therefore one's only duty is to engage himself in devotional service. This is the best end to which human life can be put. Those devotees who are constantly engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord achieve not only all material benefits but also all spiritual benefits, for at the end of life they go back home, back to Godhead. Their destination is described in this verse as bhagavat-padam. The word padam means \"abode,\" and bhagavat means \"the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\" Thus the destination of the devotees is the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

            "content": "In this verse the word naiñkarmyam, which means \"transcendental knowledge,\" is also significant. Unless one comes to the platform of transcendental knowledge and offers devotional service to the Lord, one is not perfect. Generally the processes of jïäna, yoga and karma are executed life after life before one gets a chance to render pure devotional service to the Lord. This chance is given by the grace of a pure devotee, and it is in this way only that one can actually attain liberation. In the context of this narration, the wives of the demigods repented because although they had the opportunity of a birth in a higher planetary system, a lifetime spanning millions of years and all material comforts, they were not as fortunate as Påthu Mahäräja and his wife, who were actually surpassing them. In other words, Påthu Mahäräja and his wife scorned promotion to the higher planetary systems and even to Brahmaloka because the position which they were attaining was incomparable. In Bhagavad-gétä , Lord Kåñëa also asserts:"

It is therefore said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam , naiñkarmyam apy acyuta-bhäva-varjitam: \"The path of liberation is not at all secure unless one attains the devotional service of the Lord.\" Even if one is promoted to the impersonal brahmajyoti, he runs every chance of falling down into this material world. If it is possible to fall down from the brahmajyoti, which is beyond the higher planetary systems in this material world, then what can be said of the ordinary yogés and karmés who can only be elevated to the higher material planets? Thus the wives of the denizens of the higher planetary systems did not very much appreciate the results of karma, jïäna and yoga."
