Unfortunate persons who cannot accept this formula prefer to execute some type of pseudomeditation, without accepting the other processes of austerity. The fact is, however, that one must accept either the severe method of austerity described above to become purified or take to the process of devotional service recommended for pleasing the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa. The person who is Kåñëa conscious is most intelligent because in Kali-yuga it is not at all possible to undergo such severe austerities. We need only follow great personalities like Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu. In His Çikñäñöaka, Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu wrote, paraà vijayate çré-kåñëa-saìkértanam: all glories to the holy names of Lord Kåñëa, which from the very beginning purify the heart and immediately liberate one. Bhava-mahä-dävägni-nirväpanam. If the real purpose of all yoga is to please Lord Kåñëa, then this simple bhakti-yoga system recommended for this age is sufficient. It is necessary, however, to engage constantly in the service of the Lord. Although Påthu Mahäräja executed his austerities long before the appearance of Lord Kåñëa on this planet, his purpose was still to please Kåñëa."

            "content": "There are many fools who claim that worship of Kåñëa began only about five thousand years ago, after the appearance of Lord Kåñëa in India, but this is not a fact. Påthu Mahäräja worshiped Kåñëa millions of years ago, for Påthu happened to be a descendant of the family of Mahäräja Dhruva, who reigned for thirty-six thousand years during the Satya-yuga age. Unless his total life-span was one hundred thousand years, how could Dhruva Mahäräja reign over the world for thirty-six thousand years? The point is that Kåñëa worship existed at the beginning of creation and has continued to exist throughout Satya-yuga, Tretä-yuga and Dväpara-yuga, and now it is continuing in Kali-yuga. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, Kåñëa appears not only in this millennium of Brahmä's life, but in every millennium. Therefore worship of Kåñëa is conducted in all millenniums. It is not that Kåñëa worship began only when Kåñëa appeared on this planet five thousand years ago. This is a foolish conclusion that is not substantiated by Vedic literatures."

            "content": "Also of significance in this verse are the words ärirädhayiñuù kåñëam acarat tapa uttamam. Mahäräja Påthu underwent severe types of austerities for the express purpose of worshiping Kåñëa. Kåñëa is so kind, especially in this age, that He appears in the transcendental vibration of His holy name. As is said in the Närada-païcarätra, ärädhito yadi haris tapasä tataù kim. If Kåñëa is worshiped, if He is the goal of advancement, there is no need for one to execute severe types of tapasya, because one has already reached his destination. If, after executing all types of tapasya, one cannot reach Kåñëa, all his tapasya has no value, for without Kåñëa all austerity is simply wasted labor. Çrama eva hi kevalam . We should therefore not be discouraged just because we cannot go to the forest and practice severe austerities. Our life is so short that we must strictly adhere to the principles laid down by the Vaiñëava äcäryas and peacefully execute Kåñëa consciousness. There is no need to become despondent. Narottama däsa Öhäkura recommends: änande bala hari, bhaja våndävana, çri-guru-vaiñëava-pade majäiyä mana. For a transcendental, blissful life, chant the Hare Kåñëa mantra, come worship the holy place of Våndävana, and always engage in the service of the Lord, of the spiritual master and of the Vaiñëavas. This Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore very safe and easy. We have only to execute the order of the Lord and fully surrender unto Him. We have only to execute the order of the spiritual master, preach Kåñëa consciousness and follow in the path of the Vaiñëavas. The spiritual master represents both Lord Kåñëa and the Vaiñëavas; therefore by following the instructions of the spiritual master and by chanting Hare Kåñëa, everything will be all right."
