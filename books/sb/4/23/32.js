    "translation": "If one hears of the characteristics of Påthu Mahäräja and is a brähmaëa, he becomes perfectly qualified with brahminical powers; if he is a kñatriya, he becomes a king of the world; if he is a vaiçya, he becomes a master of other vaiçyas and many animals; and if he is a çüdra, he becomes the topmost devotee.",

            "content": "In Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is recommended that one should become a devotee regardless of one's condition. Whether one is without desire (akäma) or with desire (sakäma), or whether one desires liberation (mokña-käma), he is advised to worship the Supreme Lord and execute devotional service unto Him. By so doing, one attains all perfection in any field of life. The process of devotional service—especially hearing and chanting—is so powerful that it can bring a person to the perfectional stage. In this verse brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras are mentioned, but here it should be understood that that reference is to the brähmaëa who is born in a brahminical family, the kñatriya who is born in a kñatriya family, the vaiçya who is born in a vaiçya family and the çüdra in a çüdra family. But whether one is a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra, he can attain perfection simply by hearing and chanting."

            "content": "To take birth in a family of brähmaëas is not the ultimate finishing touch; one must have the power of a brähmaëa, which is called brahma-tejas. Similarly, taking birth in a royal family is not the all in all; one must possess the power to rule the world. Similarly, taking birth as a vaiçya is not all; one must possess hundreds or thousands of animals (specifically cows) and rule over other vaiçyas as Nanda Mahäräja did in Våndävana. Nanda Mahäräja was a vaiçya who possessed nine hundred thousand cows and ruled over many cowherd men and boys. A person who is born in a çüdra family can become greater than a brähmaëa simply by accepting devotional service and giving aural reception to the pastimes of the Lord and His devotees."
