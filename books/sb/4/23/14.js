    "translation": "When Mahäräja Påthu practiced a particular yogic sitting posture, he blocked the doors of his anus with his ankles, pressed his right and left calves and gradually raised his life air upward, passing it on to the circle of his navel, up to his heart and throat, and finally pushed it upward to the central position between his two eyebrows.",

            "content": "The sitting posture described herein is called muktäsana. In the yoga process, after following the strict regulative principles controlling sleeping, eating and mating, one is allowed to practice the different sitting postures. The ultimate aim of yoga is to enable one to give up this body according to his own free will. One who has attained the ultimate summit of yoga practice can live in the body as long as he likes or, as long as he is not completely perfect, leave the body to go anywhere within or outside the universe. Some yogés leave their bodies to go to the higher planetary systems and enjoy the material facilities therein. However, intelligent yogés do not wish to waste their time within this material world at all; they do not care for the material facilities in higher planetary systems, but are interested in going directly to the spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead."

            "content": "From the description in this verse, it appears that Mahäräja Påthu had no desire to promote himself to the higher planetary systems. He wanted to return home immediately, back to Godhead. Although Mahäräja Påthu stopped all practice of mystic yoga after realizing Kåñëa consciousness, he took advantage of his previous practice and immediately placed himself on the brahma-bhüta platform in order to accelerate his return to Godhead. The aim of this particular system of äsana, known as the sitting posture for liberation, or muktäsana, is to attain success in kuëòaliné-cakra and gradually raise the life from the mülädhära-cakra to the svädhiñöhäna-cakra, then to the maëipüra-cakra, the anähata-cakra, the viçuddha-cakra, and finally to the äjïä-cakra. When the yogé reaches the äjïä-cakra, between the two eyebrows, he is able to penetrate the brahma-randhra, or the hole in his skull, and go to any planet he desires, up to the spiritual kingdom of Vaikuëöha, or Kåñëaloka. The conclusion is that one has to come to the brahma-bhüta stage :"

            "content": "The bhakti-yogé, practicing bhakti-yoga, is always situated on the brahma-bhüta stage (brahma-bhüyäya kalpate). If a devotee is able to continue on the brahma-bhüta platform, he enters the spiritual sky automatically after death and returns to Godhead. Consequently a devotee need not feel sorry for not having practiced the kuëòaliné-cakra, or not penetrating the six cakras one after another. As far as Mahäräja Påthu was concerned, he had already practiced this process, and since he did not want to wait for the time when his death would occur naturally, he took advantage of the ñaö-cakra penetration process and thus gave up the body according to his own free will and immediately entered the spiritual sky."
