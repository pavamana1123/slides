In this verse the words puruñam abhajat puruñarñabhaù are significant: puruñarñabha refers to Mahäräja Påthu, the best amongst human beings, and puruñam refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conclusion is that the best man amongst all men engages in the service of the Supreme Person. One puruña is worshipable, and the other puruña is the worshiper. When the puruña who worships, the living entity, thinks of becoming one with the Supreme person, he simply becomes bewildered and falls into the darkness of ignorance. As stated by Lord Kåñëa in Bhagavad-gétä , all living entities assembled in the battlefield, as well as Kåñëa Himself, were also present in the past as individuals and would continue to be present in the future as individuals also. Therefore the two puruñas, the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, never lose their respective identities."

Indeed, for devotees there is no difference between this life and the next. In this life a neophyte devotee is trained to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in the next life he approaches that Supreme Person in Vaikuëöha and renders the same devotional service. Even for the neophyte devotee, devotional service is considered brahma-bhüyäya kalpate :"
