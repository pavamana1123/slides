            "content": "Materialistic persons who are very fond of money and great families worship different demigods to attain their desires, especially goddess Durgä, Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä. Such materialistic persons are called çriyaiçvarya-prajepsavaù. Çré means \"beauty,\" aiçvarya means \"riches,\" prajä means \"children,\" and épsavaù means \"desiring.\" As described in the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, one has to worship various demigods for different types of benedictions. However, here it is indicated that simply by hearing of the life and character of Mahäräja Påthu, one can have both riches and children in enormous quantities. One simply has to read and understand the history, the life and activities of Påthu Mahäräja. It is advised that one read them at least three times. Those who are materially afflicted will so benefit by hearing of the Supreme Lord and His devotees that they need not go to any demigod. The word suprajatamaù (\"surrounded by many children\") is very significant in this verse, for one may have many children but may not have any qualified children. Here, however, it is stated (su-prajatamaù) that all the children thus attained would be qualified in education, wealth, beauty and strength—everything complete."
