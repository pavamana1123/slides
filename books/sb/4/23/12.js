    "translation": "When he became completely free from the conception of bodily life, Mahäräja Påthu realized Lord Kåñëa sitting in everyone's heart as the Paramätmä. Being thus able to get all instructions from Him, he gave up all other practices of yoga and jïäna. He was not even interested in the perfection of the yoga and jïäna systems, for he thoroughly realized that devotional service to Kåñëa is the ultimate goal of life and that unless the yogés and jïänés become attracted to kåñëa-kathä [narrations about Kåñëa], their illusions concerning existence can never be dispelled.",

            "content": "As long as one is too much absorbed in the bodily conception of life, he becomes interested in many different processes of self-realization, such as the mystic yoga system or the system utilizing the speculative empiric methods. However, when one understands that the ultimate goal of life is to approach Kåñëa, he realizes Kåñëa within everyone's heart and therefore helps everyone who is interested in Kåñëa consciousness. Actually the perfection of life depends on one's inclination to hear about Kåñëa. It is therefore mentioned in this verse: yävad gadägraja-kathäsu ratià na kuryät. Unless one becomes interested in Kåñëa, in His pastimes and activities, there is no question of liberation by means of yoga practice or speculative knowledge."

            "content": "Real jïäna means understanding that the living entity is the eternal servant of the Lord. This knowledge is attained after many, many births, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä : bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän mäà prapadyate. In the paramahaàsa stage of life, one fully realizes Kåñëa as everything: väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù. When one understands fully that Kåñëa is everything and that Kåñëa consciousness is the highest perfection of life, he becomes a paramahaàsa, or mahätmä. Such a mahätmä or paramahaàsa is very rare to find. A paramahaàsa, or pure devotee, is never attracted by haöha-yoga or speculative knowledge. He is simply interested in the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord. Sometimes one who was formerly addicted to these processes tries to perform devotional service and the jïäna and yoga practices at the same time, but as soon as one comes to the unalloyed stage of devotional service, he is able to give up all other methods of self-realization. In other words, when one firmly realizes Kåñëa as the supreme goal, he is no longer attracted by mystic yoga practice or the speculative empirical methods of knowledge."
