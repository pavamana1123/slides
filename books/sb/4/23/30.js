            "content": "In this verse the word bhagavattamaù is very significant, for the word bhagavat is used especially to refer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the word bhagavän (\"the Supreme Personality of Godhead\") is derived from the word bhagavat. Sometimes, however, we see that the word bhagavän is used for great personalities like Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and Närada Muni. This is the case with Påthu Mahäräja, who is described here as the best of the bhagaväns, or the best of the lords. A person can be so addressed only if he is a great personality who exhibits extraordinary and uncommon features or who attains the greatest goal after his disappearance or who knows the difference between knowledge and ignorance. In other words, the word bhagavän should not be used for ordinary persons."
