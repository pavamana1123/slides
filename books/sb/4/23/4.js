            "content": "As it is necessary for one to become very active in family life, similarly, after retirement from family life, it is necessary to control the mind and senses. This is possible when one engages himself fully in the devotional service of the Lord. Actually the whole purpose of the Vedic system, the Vedic social order, is to enable one to ultimately return home, back to Godhead. The gåhastha-äçrama is a sort of concession combining sense gratification with a regulative life. It is to enable one to easily retire in the middle of life and engage fully in austerities in order to transcend material sense gratification once and for all. Therefore in the vänaprastha stage of life, tapasya, or austerity, is strongly recommended. Mahäräja Påthu followed exactly all the rules of vänaprastha life, which is technically known as vaikhänasa-äçrama. The word vaikhänasa-susammate is significant because in vänaprastha life the regulative principles are also to be strictly followed. In other words, Mahäräja Påthu was an ideal character in every sphere of life. Mahäjano yena gataù sa panthäù:  one should follow in the footsteps of great personalities. Thus by following the exemplary character of Mahäräja Påthu, one can become perfect in all respects while living this life or while retiring from active life. Thus after giving up this body, one can become liberated and go back to Godhead."
