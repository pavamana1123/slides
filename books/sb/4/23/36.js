    "translation": "If a king, who is desirous of attaining victory and ruling power, chants the narration of Påthu Mahäräja three times before going forth on his chariot, all subordinate kings will automatically render all kinds of taxes unto him—as they rendered them unto Mahäräja Påthu—simply upon his order.",

            "content": "Since a kñatriya king naturally desires to rule the world, he wishes to make all other kings subordinate to him. This was also the position many years ago when Påthu Mahäräja was ruling over the earth. At that time he was the only emperor on this planet. Even five thousand years ago, Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and Mahäräja Parékñit were the sole emperors of this planet. Sometimes the subordinate kings rebelled, and it was necessary for the emperor to go and chastise them. This process of chanting the narrations of the life and character of Påthu Mahäräja is recommended for conquering kings if they want to fulfill their desire to rule the world."
