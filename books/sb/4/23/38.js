That is called preaching. Caitanya Mahäprabhu recommended this practice: yäre dekha, täre kaha 'kåñëa'-upadeça . \"Whomever you meet, simply talk with him about the instructions given by Kåñëa or tell him of narrations about Kåñëa.\" Påthu Mahäräja's history of devotional service is as potent as narrations about the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should not make distinctions between the pastimes of the Lord and the activities of Påthu Mahäräja, and whenever it is possible a devotee should attempt to induce others to hear about Påthu Mahäräja. One should not only read of his pastimes for one's own benefit but should induce others to read and hear about them also. In this way everyone can be benefited."
