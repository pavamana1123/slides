In this material world there is a planet known as Patiloka, just as there is a planet known as Pitåloka. But in this verse the word pati-loka does not refer to any planet within this material universe, for Påthu Mahäräja, being topmost amongst self-realized souls, certainly returned home, back to Godhead, and attained one of the Vaikuëöha planets. Queen Arci also entered Patiloka, but this planet is not in the material universe, for she actually entered the planet which her husband attained. In the material world also, when a woman dies with her husband, she again unites with him in the next birth. Similarly, Mahäräja Påthu and Queen Arci united in the Vaikuëöha planets. In the Vaikuëöha planets there are husbands and wives, but there is no question of their giving birth to children or having sex life. In the Vaikuëöha planets both husbands and wives are extraordinarily beautiful, and they are attracted to one another, but they do not enjoy sex life. Indeed, they consider sex not to be very relishable because both husband and wife are always absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness and in glorifying and chanting the glories of the Lord."

            "content": "According to Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura also, a husband and wife can turn the home into a place as good as Vaikuëöha, even while in this material world. Being absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness, even in this world husband and wife can live in Vaikuëöha simply by installing the Deity of the Lord within the home and serving the Deity according to the directions of the çästras. In this way, they will never feel the sex urge. That is the test of advancement in devotional service. One who is advanced in devotional service is never attracted by sex life, and as soon as one becomes detached from sex life and proportionately attached to the service of the Lord, he actually experiences living in the Vaikuëöha planets. In the ultimate issue, there is actually no material world, but when one forgets the service of the Lord and engages himself in the service of his senses, he is said to be living in the material world."
