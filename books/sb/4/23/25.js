    "translation": "The wives of the demigods said: All glories to Queen Arci! We can see that this queen of the great King Påthu, the emperor of all the kings of the world, has served her husband with mind, speech and body exactly as the goddess of fortune serves the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Yajïeça, or Viñëu.",

            "content": "In this verse the words yajïeçaà çrér vadhür iva indicate that Queen Arci served her husband just as the goddess of fortune serves the Supreme Personality of Godhead Viñëu. We can observe that even in the history of this world, when Lord Kåñëa, the supreme Viñëu, was ruling over Dvärakä, Queen Rukmiëé, who was the chief of all Kåñëa's queens, used to serve Lord Kåñëa personally in spite of having many hundreds of maidservants to assist her. Similarly, the goddess of fortune in the Vaikuëöha planets also serves Näräyaëa personally, although there are many thousands of devotees prepared to serve the Lord. This practice is also followed by the wives of the demigods, and in days past the wives of men also followed this same principle. In Vedic civilization the husband and wife were not separated by such man-made laws as divorce. We should understand the necessity for maintaining family life in human society and should thus abolish this artificial law known as divorce. The husband and wife should live in Kåñëa consciousness and follow in the footsteps of Lakñmé-Näräyaëa or Kåñëa-Rukmiëé. In this way peace and harmony can be possible within this world."
