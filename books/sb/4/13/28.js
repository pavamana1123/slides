Similarly, in devotional service there are offenses known as sevä-aparädha. Those who are engaged in worshiping the Deity, Rädhä and Kåñëa, in the temple, should avoid such offenses in service. The offenses in service are described in The Nectar of Devotion. If we simply make a show of offering services to the Deity but do not care for the sevä-aparädha, certainly the Rädhä-Kåñëa Deity will not accept offerings from such nondevotees. Devotees engaged in temple worship should not, therefore, manufacture their own methods, but should strictly follow the regulative principles of cleanliness, and then offerings will be accepted."
