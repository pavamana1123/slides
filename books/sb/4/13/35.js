Such action was an experiment to observe whether the Vedic mantras were being properly pronounced. Sometimes small animals are killed in a medical laboratory to investigate therapeutic effects. In a medical clinic, the animals are not revived, but in the yajïa arena, when animals were sacrificed, they were again given life by the potency of Vedic mantras. The word çipi-viñöäya appears in this verse. Çipi means \"the flames of the sacrifice.\" In the sacrificial fire if the oblations are offered into the flames, then Lord Viñëu is situated there in the form of the flames. Therefore Lord Viñëu is known as Çipiviñöa."
