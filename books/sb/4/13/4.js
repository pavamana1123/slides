The great sage Närada's mission is to broadcast the devotional service of the Lord. For this purpose he has compiled the Närada-païcarätra, a directory of devotional service, so that devotees can always take information about how to execute devotional service and thus engage twenty-four hours a day in performing sacrifices for the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord has created four orders of social life, namely brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra. In the Närada-païcarätra it is very clearly described how each of the social orders can please the Supreme Lord. In the Bhagavad-gétä  also it is stated, svanuñöhitasya dharmasya saàsiddhir hari-toñaëam: the perfection of duty is to see that by discharging one's specific duties one satisfies the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the Pracetäs were performing sacrifices according to this direction, Närada Muni was satisfied to see these activities, and he also wanted to glorify Dhruva Mahäräja in that sacrificial arena."
