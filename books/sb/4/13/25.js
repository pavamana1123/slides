    "translation": "Çré Maitreya replied: My dear Vidura, once the great King Aìga arranged to perform the great sacrifice known as açvamedha. All the expert brähmaëas present knew how to invite the demigods, but in spite of their efforts, no demigods participated or appeared in that sacrifice.",

            "content": "A Vedic sacrifice is not an ordinary performance. The demigods used to participate in such sacrifices, and the animals sacrificed in such performances were reincarnated with new life. In this age of Kali there are no powerful brähmaëas who can invite the demigods or give renewed life to animals. Formerly, the brähmaëas well conversant in Vedic mantras could show the potency of the mantras, but in this age, because there are no such brähmaëas, all such sacrifices are forbidden. The sacrifice in which horses were offered was called açvamedha. Sometimes cows were sacrificed (gavälambha), not for eating purposes, but to give them new life in order to show the potency of the mantra. In this age, therefore, the only practical yajïa is saìkértana-yajïa, or chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra twenty-four hours a day."
