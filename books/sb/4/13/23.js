He is called nara-näräyaëa, indicating that Näräyaëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in human society as the king. It is etiquette that neither a brähmaëa nor a kñatriya king is ever insulted by the citizens; even though a king appears to be sinful, the citizens should not insult him. But in the case of Vena it appears that he was cursed by the nara-devatäs; therefore, it was concluded that his sinful activities were very grievous."
