    "translation": "The head priests said: O King, in this life we do not find any sinful activity, even within your mind, so you are not in the least offensive. But we can see that in your previous life you performed sinful activities due to which, in spite of your having all qualifications, you have no son.",

Cäëakya Paëòita therefore says, putra-hénaà gåhaà çünyam: without a son, married life is simply abominable. King Aìga was a very pious king in this life, but because of his previous sinful activity he could not get a son. It is concluded, therefore, that if a person does not get a son it is due to his past sinful life."
