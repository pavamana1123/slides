As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä , mayä tatam idaà sarvaà jagad avyakta-mürtinä: Lord Kåñëa is spread all over the universe in His impersonal feature. Everything is resting on Him, but that does not mean that everything is He Himself. A highly advanced mahä-bhägavata devotee sees in this spirit: he sees the same Supersoul, Paramätmä, existing within everyone's heart, regardless of discrimination based on the different material forms of the living entities. He sees everyone as part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The mahä-bhägavata, who experiences the Supreme Godhead's presence everywhere, is never missing from the sight of the Supreme Lord, nor is the Supreme Lord ever lost from his sight. This is possible only when one is advanced in love of Godhead."
