Päïcarätrika-vidhi is the method of temple worship, and bhägavata-vidhi is the system of nine processes which begin with hearing and chanting. The Kåñëa conscious movement accepts both processes simultaneously and thus enables one to make steady progress on the path of realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This päïcarätrika procedure was first introduced by the great sage Närada, as referred to here by Vidura."
