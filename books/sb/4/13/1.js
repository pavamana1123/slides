Transcendental subject matter is so nice that no one becomes tired of hearing or speaking. Others, who are not devotees, may think, \"How can people devote so much time simply to talks of God?\" But devotees are never satiated in hearing and speaking about the Supreme Personality of Godhead or about His devotees. The more they hear and talk, the more they become enthusiastic to hear. The chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra is simply the repetition of three words, Hare, Kåñëa and Räma, but still devotees can go on chanting this Hare Kåñëa mantra twenty-four hours a day without feeling fatigued."
