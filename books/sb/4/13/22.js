The king must have done something very serious, otherwise how could the great sages, who were supposed to be the greatest and most tolerant, still punish him in spite of their elevated religious consciousness? It appears also that the king was not independent of the brahminical culture. Above the king was the control of the brähmaëas, and if needed the brähmaëas would dethrone the king or kill him, not with any weapon, but with the mantra of a brahma-çäpa. The brähmaëas were so powerful that simply by their cursing one would immediately die."
