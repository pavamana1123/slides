            "content": "The word udära-dhéù is significant in this connection. The wife of the King, Sunéthä, was not fit to accept this benediction, yet the King was so liberal that without hesitation he offered to his wife the boiled rice in milk prasäda received from the yajïa-puruña. Of course, everything is designed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As will be explained in later verses, this incident was not very favorable for the King. Since the King was very liberal, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in order to increase his detachment from this material world, willed that a cruel son be born of the Queen so that the King would have to leave home. As stated above, Lord Viñëu fulfills the desires of the karmés as they desire, but the Lord fulfills the desire of a devotee in a different way so that the devotee may gradually come to Him. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä ( dadämi buddhi-yogaà taà yena mäm upayänti te). The Lord gives the devotee the opportunity to make progress further and further so that he may come back home, back to Godhead."
