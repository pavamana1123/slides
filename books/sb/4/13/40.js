The kñatriya kings were sometimes expected to cut off the head of a culprit in the state. For this reason the kñatriyas were allowed to hunt in the forest. Because this son of King Aìga, Vena, was born of a bad mother, he was very cruel, and he used to go to the forest and unnecessarily kill the animals. All the neighboring inhabitants would be frightened by his presence, and they would call, \"Here comes Vena! Here comes Vena!\" So from the beginning of his life he was fearful to the citizens."
