When a person regrets his sinful activities, the abandoning of Kåñëa consciousness and good intelligence, his path of deliverance from the path of material clutches is opened. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam : paräbhavas tävad abodha jäto yävan na jijïäsata ätma-tattvam. When a person loses his Kåñëa consciousness and loses interest in self-realization, he must engage in sinful activities. All one's activities in a life devoid of Kåñëa consciousness simply lead to defeat and misuse of one's life. Naturally one who comes to Kåñëa consciousness regrets his previous sinful activities in the human form. Only by this process can one be delivered from the clutches of nescience or ignorance in materialistic life."
