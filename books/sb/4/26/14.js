When a man becomes refreshed by association with devotees and awakes to Kåñëa consciousness, he consults the activities of his mind—namely thinking, feeling and willing—and decides whether he should return to his material activities or stay steady in spiritual consciousness. The word kuçalam refers to that which is auspicious. One can make his home perfectly auspicious when he engages in devotional service to Lord Viñëu. When one is engaged in activities other than viñëu-bhakti, or in other words when one is engaged in material activities, he is always filled with anxieties. A sane man should consult his mind, its thinking, feeling and willing processes, and decide how these processes should be utilized. If one always thinks of Kåñëa, feels how to serve Him and wills to execute the order of Kåñëa, it should be known that he has taken good instruction from his intelligence, which is called the mother. Although the King was refreshed, he nonetheless inquired about his wife. Thus he was consulting, thinking and willing how he could return to his steady good consciousness. The mind may suggest that by viñaya-bhoga, or sense enjoyment, one can become happy, but when one becomes advanced in Kåñëa consciousness, he does not derive happiness from material activities. This is explained in Bhagavad-gétä :"
