            "content": "Just as a government may issue trade licenses in order for its citizens to act in a certain way, the Vedas contain injunctions that restrain and regulate all of our fruitive activities. All living entities have come into this material world to enjoy themselves. Consequently, the Vedas are given to regulate sense enjoyment. One who enjoys his senses under the Vedic regulative principles does not become entangled in the actions and reactions of his activities. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , yajïärthät karmaëaù: one should act only for the performance of yajïa, or to satisfy Lord Viñëu. Anyatra loko 'yaà karma-bandhanaù: otherwise any action will produce a reaction by which the living entity will be bound. A human being is especially meant to attain liberation from the bondage of birth, death, old age and disease. He is therefore directed by the Vedic regulative principles to work in such a way that he may fulfill his desires for sense gratification and at the same time gradually become freed from material bondage. Action according to such principles is called knowledge. Indeed, the word veda means \"knowledge.\" The words jïänena na sa lipyate indicate that by following the Vedic principles, one does not become involved in the actions and reactions of his fruitive activities."

            "content": "Everyone is therefore advised to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions and not irresponsibly. When a person within a state acts according to the laws and licenses of the government, he does not become involved in criminal activities. Man-made laws, however, are always defective because they are made by men who are prone to committing mistakes, being illusioned, cheating and having imperfect senses. The Vedic instructions are different because they do not have these four defects. Vedic instructions are not subject to mistakes. The knowledge of the Vedas is knowledge received directly from God, and there is consequently no question of illusion, cheating, mistakes or imperfect senses. All Vedic knowledge is perfect because it is received directly from God by the paramparä, disciplic succession. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is said: tene brahma hådä ya ädi-kavaye. The original creature of this universe, known as the ädi-kavi, or Lord Brahmä, was instructed by Kåñëa through the heart. After receiving these Vedic instructions from Lord Kåñëa Himself, Brahmä distributed the knowledge by the paramparä system to Närada, and Närada in turn distributed the knowledge to Vyäsa. In this way Vedic knowledge is perfect. If we act according to Vedic knowledge, there is no question of being involved in sinful activities."
