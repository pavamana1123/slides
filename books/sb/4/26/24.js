But for the servant of Muraripu [Kåñëa], I excuse no one within or beyond these three worlds. No one can freely move after offending you, for I am prepared to punish him.",

In other words, upon breaking the laws of the state, everyone can be punished by the government except the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas. Brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas never transgress the laws of the state or the laws of nature because they know perfectly well the resultant reactions caused by such law-breaking. Even though they may sometimes appear to violate the laws, they are not to be punished by the king. This instruction was given to King Präcénabarhiñat by Närada Muni. King Puraïjana was a representative of King Präcénabarhiñat, and Närada Muni was reminding King Präcénabarhiñat of his forefather, Mahäräja Påthu, who never chastised a brähmaëa or a Vaiñëava."

Pure consciousness can be revived by the process of sacrifice, charity, pious activities, etc., but when one pollutes his Kåñëa consciousness by offending a brähmaëa or a Vaiñëava, it is very difficult to revive. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has described the vaiñëava-aparädha, or offense to a Vaiñëava, as \"the mad elephant offense.\" One should be very careful not to offend a Vaiñëava or a brähmaëa. Even the great yogé Durväsä was harassed by the Sudarçana cakra when he offended the Vaiñëava Mahäräja Ambaréña, who was neither a brähmaëa nor a sannyäsé but an ordinary householder. Mahäräja Ambaréña was a Vaiñëava, and consequently Durväsä Muni was chastised."

This was the course that Durväsä Muni had to follow, for he surrendered unto Mahäräja Ambaréña. A vaiñëava-aparädha cannot be atoned for by any means other than by begging the pardon of the offended Vaiñëava."
