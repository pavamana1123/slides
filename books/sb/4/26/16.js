In material existence there is danger at every step. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is said: padaà padaà yad vipadäà na teñäm. This material world is not actually a place of residence for an intelligent person or a devotee because here there is danger at every step. Vaikuëöha is the real home for the devotee, for there is no anxiety and no danger. Good intelligence means becoming Kåñëa conscious. In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is said: kåñëa ye bhaje se baòa catura. Unless one is Kåñëa conscious, he cannot be called an intelligent person."

            "content": "Herein we see that King Puraïjana was searching after his good wife, who always helped him out of the dangerous situations that always occur in material existence. As already explained, a real wife is dharma-patné. That is, a woman accepted in marriage by ritualistic ceremony is called dharma-patné, which signifies that she is accepted in terms of religious principles. Children born of dharma-patné, or a woman married according to religious principles, inherit the property of the father, but children born of a woman who is not properly married do not inherit the father's property. The word dharma-patné also refers to a chaste wife. A chaste wife is one who never had any connection with men before her marriage. Once a woman is given the freedom to mingle with all kinds of men in her youth, it is very difficult for her to keep chaste. She generally cannot remain chaste. When butter is brought into the proximity of fire, it melts. The woman is like fire, and man is like the butter. But if one gets a chaste wife, accepted through a religious marriage ritual, she can be of great help when one is threatened by the many dangerous situations of life. Actually such a wife can become the source of all good intelligence. With such a good wife, the family's engagement in the devotional service of the Lord actually makes a home a gåhastha-äçrama, or household dedicated to spiritual cultivation."
