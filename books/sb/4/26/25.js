A woman generally becomes very attractive when her lips are colored with reddish saffron or vermillion. But when one's consciousness and intelligence are without any brilliant thoughts about Kåñëa, they become morose and lusterless, so much so that one cannot derive any benefit despite sharp intelligence."
