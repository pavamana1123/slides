            "content": "When a man comes into good consciousness and accepts a saintly person as a spiritual master, he hears many Vedic instructions in the form of philosophy, stories, narrations about great devotees and transactions between God and His devotees. In this way a man becomes refreshed in mind, exactly like a person who smears scented sandalwood pulp all over his body and decorates himself with ornaments. These decorations may be compared to knowledge of religion and the self. Through such knowledge one becomes detached from a materialistic way of life and engages himself in always hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Bhagavad-gétä and other Vedic literatures. The word sädhv-alaìkåta used in this verse indicates that one must be absorbed in knowledge gathered from the instructions of saintly persons. Just as King Puraïjana began to search out his better half, the Queen, one who is decorated with knowledge and instructions from saintly persons should try to search out his original consciousness, Kåñëa consciousness. One cannot return to Kåñëa consciousness unless he is favored by the instructions of a saintly person. Therefore Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura sings: sädhu-çästra-guru-väkya, cittete kariyä aikya. If we want to become saintly persons, or if we want to return to our original Kåñëa consciousness, we must associate with sädhu (a saintly person), çästra (authoritative Vedic literature) and guru (a bona fide spiritual master). This is the process."
