            "content": "It is recommended here that even if one cannot arrange to worship the forms of the Lord with all recommended paraphernalia, one can simply think about the form of the Lord and mentally offer everything recommended in the çästras, including flowers, candana pulp, conchshell, umbrella, fan and cämara. One can meditate upon offering and chant the twelve-syllable mantra, oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya. Since the mantra and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are nondifferent, one can worship the form of the Lord with the mantra in the absence of physical paraphernalia. The story of the brähmaëa who worshiped the Lord within his mind, as related in Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu, or The Nectar of Devotion, should be consulted in this connection. If paraphernalia is not present physically, one can think of the items and offer them to the Deity by chanting the mantra. Such are the liberal and potent facilities in the process of devotional service."
