    "translation": "The Lord is further described as having the mark of Çrévatsa, or the sitting place of the goddess of fortune, and His bodily hue is deep bluish. The Lord is a person, He wears a garland of flowers, and He is eternally manifest with four hands, which hold [beginning from the lower left hand] a conchshell, wheel, club and lotus flower.",

            "content": "Here in this verse the word puruñam is very significant. The Lord is never female. He is always male (puruña). Therefore the impersonalist who imagines the Lord's form as that of a woman is mistaken. The Lord appears in female form if necessary, but His perpetual form is puruña because He is originally male. The feminine feature of the Lord is displayed by goddesses of fortune—Lakñmé, Rädhäräëé, Sétä, etc. All these goddesses of fortune are servitors of the Lord; they are not the Supreme, as falsely imagined by the impersonalist. Lord Kåñëa in His Näräyaëa feature is always four handed. On the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, when Arjuna wanted to see His universal form, He showed this feature of four-handed Näräyaëa. Some devotees are of the opinion that Kåñëa is an incarnation of Näräyaëa, but the Bhägavata school says that Näräyaëa is a manifestation of Kåñëa."
