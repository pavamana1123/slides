A person constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord cannot be deviated from meditating on the form of the Lord, as described herein. The arcana-märga, or the devotional path prescribed in the Païcarätra system of devotional service for worshiping the Deity in the temple, makes the devotee think constantly of the Lord; that is samädhi, or trance. One who practices in this way cannot deviate from the service of the Lord, and that makes him perfect in the mission of human life."
