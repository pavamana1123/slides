            "content": "Sometimes when we hear that great sages and devotees go to the forest and engage themselves in devotional service or meditation, we become surprised: how can one live in the forest and not be taken care of by anyone? But the answer, given by a great authority, Närada Muni, is that such persons are well protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çaraëägati, or surrender, means acceptance or firm belief that wherever the surrendered soul lives he is always protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; he is never alone or unprotected. Dhruva Mahäräja's affectionate father thought his young boy, only five years old, to be in a very precarious position in the jungle, but Närada Muni assured him, \"You do not have sufficient information about the influence of your son.\" Anyone who engages in devotional service, anywhere within this universe, is never unprotected."
