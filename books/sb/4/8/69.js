            "content": "Here in this verse Närada Muni has described Dhruva Mahäräja as prabhu. This word is applicable to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes the spiritual master is addressed as Prabhupäda. Prabhu means \"the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\" and päda means \"post.\" According to Vaiñëava philosophy, the spiritual master occupies the post of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or in other words he is the bona fide representative of the Supreme Lord. Dhruva Mahäräja is also described here as prabhu because he is an äcärya of the Vaiñëava school. Another meaning of prabhu is \"master of the senses,\" just like the word svämé. Another significant word is suduñkaram, \"very difficult to perform.\" What was the task that Dhruva Mahäräja undertook? The most difficult task in life is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Dhruva Mahäräja would be able to do that. We must remember that Dhruva Mahäräja was not fickle; he was determined to execute his service and then come back. Every devotee, therefore, should be determined that in this life he will be able to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead and by that process go back home, back to Godhead. That is the perfection of the highest mission of life."
