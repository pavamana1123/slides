            "content": "The great sage Maitreya wanted to describe the pious activities of the kings. Priyavrata was the first son of Sväyambhuva Manu, and Uttänapäda was the second, but the great sage Maitreya immediately began to speak of Dhruva Mahäräja, the son of Uttänapäda, because Maitreya was very eager to describe pious activities. The incidents in the life of Dhruva Mahäräja are very attractive for devotees. From his pious actions, one can learn how one can detach himself from material possessions and how one can enhance one's devotional service by severe austerities and penances. By hearing the activities of pious Dhruva, one can enhance one's faith in God and can directly connect with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus one can very soon be elevated to the transcendental platform of devotional service. The example of Dhruva Mahäräja's austerities can immediately generate a feeling of devotional service in the hearts of the hearers."
