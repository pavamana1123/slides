Although Brahmä is jéva-tattva, he is empowered by the Lord, and therefore he is considered a plenary expansion of the Supreme Godhead. Sometimes it happens that when there is no suitable living being to be empowered to act as Brahmä, the Supreme Lord Himself appears as Brahmä. Brahmä is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Sväyambhuva Manu was the direct son of Brahmä. The great sage Maitreya is now going to explain about the descendants of this Manu, all of whom are widely celebrated for their pious activities. Before speaking of these pious descendants, Maitreya has already described the descendants of impious activities, representing anger, envy, unpalatable speech, quarrel, fear and death. Purposely, therefore, he is next relating the history of the life of Dhruva Mahäräja, the most pious king within this universe."
