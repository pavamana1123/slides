            "content": "It is understood herein that Adharma, Irreligion, was also a son of Brahmä, and he married his sister Måñä. This is the beginning of sex life between brother and sister. This unnatural combination of sex life can be possible in human society only where there is Adharma, or Irreligion. It is understood that in the beginning of creation Brahmä created not only saintly sons like Sanaka, Sanätana and Närada but also demonic offspring like Niråti, Adharma, Dambha and Falsity. Everything was created by Brahmä in the beginning. Regarding Närada, it is understood that because his previous life was very pious and his association very good, he was born as Närada. Others were also born in their own capacities, according to their backgrounds. The law of karma continues birth after birth, and when there is a new creation, the same karma comes back with the living entities. They are born in different capacities according to karma even though their father is originally Brahmä, who is the exalted qualitative incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
