            "content": "The system of brahmacarya has been current since the birth of Brahmä. A section of the population, especially male, did not marry at all. Instead of allowing their semen to be driven downwards, they used to lift the semen up to the brain. They are called ürdhva-retasaù, those who lift up. Semen is so important that if, by the yogic process, one can lift the semen up to the brain, he can perform wonderful work—one's memory is enabled to act very swiftly, and the duration of life is increased. Yogés can thus perform all kinds of austerity with steadiness and be elevated to the highest perfectional stage, even to the spiritual world. Vivid examples of brahmacärés who accepted this principle of life are the four sages Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanätana and Sanat-kumära, as well as Närada and others."

            "content": "Another significant phrase here is naite gåhän hy ävasan, \"they did not live at home.\" Gåha means \"home\" as well as \"wife.\" In fact, \"home\" means wife; \"home\" does not mean a room or a house. One who lives with a wife lives at home, otherwise a sannyäsé or brahmacäri, even though he may live in a room or in a house, does not live at home. That they did not live at home means that they did not accept a wife, and so there was no question of their discharging semen. Semen is meant to be discharged when one has a home, a wife and the intention to beget children, otherwise there is no injunction for discharging semen. These principles were followed from the beginning of creation, and such brahmacärés never created progeny. This narration has dealt with the descendants of Lord Brahmä from Manu's daughter Prasüti. prasüti's daughter was Däkñäyaëé, or Saté, in relation to whom the story of the Dakña yajïa was narrated. Maitreya is now explaining about the progeny of the sons of Brahmä. Out of the many sons of Brahmä, the brahmacäré sons headed by Sanaka and Närada did not marry at all, and therefore there is no question of narrating the history of their descendants."
