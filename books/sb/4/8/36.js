    "translation": "My dear lord, I am very impudent for not accepting your instructions, but this is not my fault. It is due to my having been born in a kñatriya family. My stepmother, Suruci, has pierced my heart with her harsh words. Therefore your valuable instruction does not stand in my heart.",

He said that his heart, having been pierced by the arrows of his stepmother's harsh words, felt so broken that nothing seemed valuable but his desire to counteract her insult. His stepmother had said that because he was born from the womb of Sunéti, a neglected queen of Mahäräja Uttänapäda, Dhruva Mahäräja was not fit to sit either on the throne or on his father's lap. In other words, according to his stepmother, he could not be declared king. Dhruva Mahäräja's determination, therefore, was to become king of a planet exalted even beyond that possessed by Lord Brahmä, the greatest of all the demigods."

            "content": "Dhruva Mahäräja indirectly informed the great sage Närada that there are four kinds of human spirit—the brahminical spirit, the kñatriya spirit, the vaiçya spirit and the çüdra spirit. The spirit of one caste is not applicable to the members of another. The philosophical spirit enunciated by Närada Muni might have been suitable for a brähmaëa spirit, but it was not suitable for a kñatriya. Dhruva frankly admitted that he was lacking in brahminical humility and was therefore unable to accept the philosophy of Närada Muni."

            "content": "The statements of Dhruva Mahäräja indicate that unless a child is trained according to his tendency, there is no possibility of his developing his particular spirit. It was the duty of the spiritual master or teacher to observe the psychological movement of a particular boy and thus train him in a particular occupational duty. Dhruva Mahäräja, having already been trained in the kñatriya spirit, would not accept the brahminical philosophy. In America we have practical experience of this incompatibility of the brahminical and kñatriya temperaments. The American boys, who have simply been trained as çüdras, are not at all fit to fight in battle. Therefore, when they are called to join the military, they refuse because they do not have kñatriya spirit. This is a cause of great dissatisfaction in society."

            "content": "That the boys do not have the kñatriya spirit does not mean that they are trained in brahminical qualities; they are trained as çüdras, and thus in frustration they are becoming hippies. However, as soon as they enter the Kåñëa consciousness movement being started in America, they are trained to meet the brahminical qualifications, even though they have fallen to the lowest conditions as çüdras. In other words, since the Kåñëa consciousness movement is open for everyone, people in general can attain the brahminical qualifications. This is the greatest need at the present moment, for now there are actually no brähmaëas or kñatriyas but only some vaiçyas and, for the most part, çüdras. The classification of society into brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras is very scientific. In the human social body, the brähmaëas are considered the head, the kñatriyas are the arms, the vaiçyas are the belly, and the çüdras are the legs. At the present moment the body has legs and a belly, but there are no arms or head, and therefore society is topsy-turvy. It is necessary to reestablish the brahminical qualifications in order to raise the fallen human society to the highest standard of spiritual consciousness."
