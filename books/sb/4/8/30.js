Çré Närada Muni, the supreme spiritual master, is testing Dhruva Mahäräja to see how determined he is to prosecute devotional service. This is the process of accepting a disciple. The great sage Närada has come to Dhruva under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to initiate him, yet he is testing Dhruva's determination to execute the process. It is a fact, however, that for a sincere person devotional service is very easy. But for one who is not determined and sincere, this process is very difficult."
