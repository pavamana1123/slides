It appears that the kñatriya blood within the body of Dhruva Mahäräja was naturally very active. If the brahminical, kñatriya or vaiçya culture is maintained in a family, naturally the sons and grandsons inherit the spirit of the particular class. Therefore, according to the Vedic system, the saàskära, or the reformatory system, is maintained very rigidly. If one fails to observe the reformatory measures current in the family, one is immediately degraded to a lower standard of life."
