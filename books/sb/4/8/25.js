            "content": "When Dhruva Mahäräja was talking with his mother, Sunéti, of all the incidents that had taken place in the palace, Närada was not present. Thus the question may be raised how Närada overheard all these topics. The answer is that Närada is trikäla-jïa; he is so powerful that he can understand the past, future and present of everyone's heart, just like the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, after understanding the strong determination of Dhruva Mahäräja, Närada came to help him. It may be explained in this way: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is present in everyone's heart, and as soon as He understands that a living entity is serious about entering devotional service, He sends His representative. In this way Närada was sent to Dhruva Mahäräja. This is explained in the Caitanya-caritämåta. Guru-kåñëa-prasäde päya bhakti-latä-béja:  by the grace of the spiritual master and Kåñëa, one can enter into devotional service. Because of Dhruva Mahäräja's determination, Kåñëa, the Supersoul, immediately sent His representative, Närada, to initiate him."
