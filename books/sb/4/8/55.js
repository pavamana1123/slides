In the Western countries, while engaged in propagating the Kåñëa consciousness movement, we were brought great unhappiness because we could not find tulasé leaves. We are very much obliged, therefore, to our disciple Çrématé Govinda däsé because she has taken much care to grow tulasé plants from seeds, and she has been successful by the grace of Kåñëa. Now tulasé plants are growing in almost every center of our movement."

            "content": "Tulasé leaves are very important in the method of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse the word salilaiù means \"by the water.\" Of course, Dhruva Mahäräja was worshiping on the bank of the Yamunä. The Yamunä and the Ganges are sacred, and sometimes devotees in India insist that the Deity must be worshiped with water of the Ganges or Yamunä. But here we understand deça-käla to mean \"according to time and country.\" In the Western countries there is no River Yamunä or Ganges—water from such sacred rivers is not available. Does this mean that the arcä worship should for that reason be stopped? No. Salilaiù refers to any water—whatever is available—but it must be very clear and collected purely. That water can be used. The other paraphernalia, such as flower garlands, fruits and vegetables, should be collected according to the country and according to their availability. Tulasé leaves are very important for satisfying the Lord, so as far as possible an arrangement should be made for growing tulasé leaves. Dhruva Mahäräja was advised to worship the Lord with the fruits and flowers available in the forest. In the Bhagavad-gétä Kåñëa frankly says that He accepts vegetables, fruits, flowers, etc. One should not offer Lord Väsudeva anything other than what is prescribed herein by the great authority Närada Muni. One cannot offer to the Deity according to one's whims; since these fruits and vegetables are available anywhere in the universe, we should observe this small point very attentively."
