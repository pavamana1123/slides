Now, Närada Muni is especially giving him directions how this worship of the Supreme Person can very quickly fructify. He recommends that Dhruva Mahäräja go to the bank of the Yamunä, where there is a forest of the name Madhuvana, and begin his meditation and worship there."

            "content": "Places of pilgrimage yield a special advantage for a devotee in quickly advancing his spiritual life. Lord Kåñëa lives everywhere, but still it is very easy to approach Him in holy places of pilgrimage because these places are inhabited by great sages. Lord Çré Kåñëa says that He lives wherever His devotees are chanting the glories of His transcendental activities. There are many places of pilgrimage in India, and especially prominent are Badaré-näräyaëa, Dvärakä, Rämeçvara and Jagannätha puré. These sacred places are called the four dhämas. Dhäma refers to a place where one can immediately contact the Supreme Lord. To go to Badaré-näräyaëa one has to pass through Hardwar on the path to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, there are other holy places of pilgrimage, such as Prayäga (Allahabad) and Mathurä, and the topmost of them all is Våndävana. Unless one is very advanced in spiritual life, it is recommended that he live in such holy places and execute devotional service there. But an advanced devotee like Närada Muni who is engaged in preaching work can serve the Supreme Lord anywhere. Sometimes he even goes to the hellish planets. Hellish conditions do not affect Närada Muni because he is engaged in greatly responsible activities in devotional service. According to the statement of Närada Muni, Madhuvana, which is still existing in the Våndävana area, in the district of Mathurä, is a most sacred place. Many saintly persons still live there and engage in the devotional service of the Lord."

There are five forests on the eastern bank of the Yamunä: Bhadravana, Bilvavana, Lauhavana, Bhäëòéravana and Mahävana. On the western side of the bank there are seven: Madhuvana, Tälavana, Kumudavana, Bahulävana, Kämyavana, Khadiravana and Våndävana. In those twelve forests there are different ghäöas, or bathing places. They are listed as follows: (1) Avimukta, (2) Adhirüòha, (3) Guhya-tértha, (4) Prayäga-tértha, (5) Kanakhala, (6) Tinduka-tértha, (7) Sürya-tértha, (8) Vaöasvämé, (9) Dhruva-ghäöa (Dhruva-ghäöa, where there are many nice trees of fruits and flowers, is famous because Dhruva Mahäräja meditated and underwent severe penances and austerities there in an elevated spot), (10) Åñi-tértha, (11) Mokña-tértha, (12) Budha-tértha, (13) Gokarëa, (14) Kåñëagaìgä, (15) Vaikuëöha, (16) Asi-kuëòa, (17) Catuù-sämudrika-küpa, (18) Akrüra-tértha (when Kåñëa and Balaräma were going to Mathurä in the chariot driven by Akrüra, all of them took baths in this ghäöa), (19) Yäjïika-vipra-sthäna, (20) Kubjä-küpa, (21) Raìga-sthala, (22) Maïcha-sthala, (23) Mallayuddha-sthäna, and (24) Daçäçvamedha."
