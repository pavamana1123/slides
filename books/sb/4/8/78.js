            "content": "In this verse the particular word brahma is very significant. Brahman refers to one who not only is the greatest, but has the potency to expand to an unlimited extent. How was it possible for Dhruva Mahäräja to capture Brahman within his heart? This question has been very nicely answered by Jéva Gosvämé. He says that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the origin of Brahman, for since He comprises everything material and spiritual, there cannot be anything greater than He. In the Bhagavad-gétä also the Supreme Godhead says, \"I am the resting place of Brahman.\" Many persons, especially the Mäyävädé philosophers, consider Brahman the biggest, all-expanding substance, but according to this verse and other Vedic literatures, such as Bhagavad-gétä, the resting place of Brahman is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the resting place of the sunshine is the sun globe. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, therefore, says that since the transcendental form of the Lord is the seed of all greatness, He is the Supreme Brahman. Since the Supreme Brahman was situated in the heart of Dhruva Mahäräja, he became heavier than the heaviest, and therefore everything trembled in all three worlds and in the spiritual world."

            "content": "The mahat-tattva, or the sum total of the material creation, is to be understood to be the ultimate end of all universes, including all the living entities therein. Brahman is the resort of the mahat-tattva, which includes all material and spiritual entities. It is described in this connection that the Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, is the master of both pradhäna and puruña. Pradhäna means subtle matter, such as ether. puruña means the spiritual spark living entities who are entangled in that subtle material existence. These may also be described as parä prakåti and aparä prakåti, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä. Kåñëa, being the controller of both the prakåtis, is thus the master of pradhäna and puruña. In the Vedic hymns also the Supreme Brahman is described as antaù-praviñöaù çästä. This indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is controlling everything and entering into everything. The Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38) further confirms this. Aëòäntara-stha-paramäëu-cayäntara-stham: He has entered not only the universes, but even the atom. In Bhagavad-gétä . Yoginäm api sarveñäm: of all yogés, the bhakti-yogé, who thinks of Kåñëa always within his heart and engages in His loving transcendental service, is the topmost. Ordinary yogés can exhibit wonderful material activities, known as añöa-siddhi, eight kinds of yogic perfection, but a pure devotee of the Lord can surpass these perfections by performing activities which can make the whole universe tremble."
