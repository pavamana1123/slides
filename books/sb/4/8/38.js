He also expressed his gladness that he had met such an exalted person as Närada, whose only concern was to illuminate the world, like the sun, which rotates all over the universe only for the purpose of benefiting the inhabitants of all planets. Närada Muni travels all over the universe for the sole purpose of performing the best welfare activity for the entire universe by teaching everyone how to become a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Dhruva Mahäräja felt fully assured that Närada Muni could fulfill his desire, even though the desire was very extraordinary."

Dhruva Mahäräja requested Närada Muni to be merciful to him. He pointed out that Närada travels all over the universe just for the purpose of doing good to all conditioned souls. He requested that Närada Muni show his mercy by awarding him the benefit of his particular desire. Dhruva Mahäräja was strongly determined to fulfill his desire, and it was for that purpose that he had left his home and palace."
