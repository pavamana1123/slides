    "translation": "Queen Suruci told Dhruva Mahäräja: My dear child, you do not deserve to sit on the throne or on the lap of the King. Surely you are also the son of the King, but because you did not take your birth from my womb, you are not qualified to sit on your father's lap.",

Rather, this privilege was dependent on one's having taken birth from her womb. In other words, she indirectly informed Dhruva Mahäräja that although he happened to be born of the King, he was considered an illegitimate son because of his birth from the womb of the other queen."
