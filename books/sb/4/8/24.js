But mere lamentation is useless—one should find out the means to mitigate one's lamentation. Thus both mother and son decided to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord because that is the only solution to all material problems. It is indicated in this connection that Dhruva Mahäräja left his father's capital city to go to a secluded place to search out the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is the instruction of Prahläda Mahäräja also that if one is seeking peace of mind he should free himself from all contamination of family life and take shelter of the Supreme Godhead by going to the forest. To the Gauòéya Vaiñëava this forest is the forest of Våndä, or Våndävana. If one takes shelter of Våndävana under Våndävaneçvaré, Çrématé Rädhäräëé, certainly all the problems of his life are solved very easily."
