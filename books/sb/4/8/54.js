One should install the physical forms of the Lord, and with the chanting of the mantra one should offer flowers and fruits and other varieties of foodstuffs exactly according to the rules and regulations prescribed by authorities. But this should be done in consideration of place, time, and attendant conveniences and inconveniences.",

            "content": "Oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya is known as the dvädaçäkñara-mantra. This mantra is chanted by Vaiñëava devotees, and it begins with praëava, or oàkära. There is an injunction that those who are not brähmaëas cannot pronounce the praëava mantra. But Dhruva Mahäräja was born a kñatriya. He at once admitted before Närada Muni that as a kñatriya he was unable to accept Närada's instruction of renunciation and mental equilibrium, which are the concern of a brähmaëa. Still, although not a brähmaëa but a kñatriya, Dhruva was allowed, on the authority of Närada, to pronounce the praëava oàkära. This is very significant. Especially in India, the caste brähmaëas object greatly when persons from other castes, who are not born in brähmaëa families, recite this praëava mantra. But here is tacit proof that if a person accepts the Vaiñëava mantra or Vaiñëava way of worshiping the Deity, he is allowed to chant the praëava mantra. In Bhagavad-gétä the Lord personally accepts that anyone, even one of a low species, can be elevated to the highest position and go back home, back to Godhead, simply if he worships properly."

            "content": "The prescribed rules, as stated here by Närada Muni, are that one should accept the mantra through a bona fide spiritual master and hear the mantra in the right ear. Not only should one chant or murmur the mantra, but in front of him he must have the Deity, or physical form of the Lord. Of course, when the Lord appears it is no longer a physical form. For example, when an iron rod is made red-hot in a fire, it is no longer iron; it is fire. Similarly, when we make a form of the Lord—whether of wood or stone or metal or jewels or paint, or even a form within the mind—it is a bona fide, spiritual, transcendental form of the Lord. Not only must one receive the mantra from the bona fide spiritual master like Närada Muni or his representative in the disciplic succession, but one must chant the mantra. And not only must one chant, but he should also offer whatever foodstuff is available in his part of the world, according to time and convenience."

It is specifically mentioned in this verse that one should take consideration of the time, place and available conveniences. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is going on throughout the entire world, and we also install Deities in different centers. Sometimes our Indian friends, puffed up with concocted notions, criticize, \"This has not been done. That has not been done.\" But they forget this instruction of Närada Muni to one of the greatest Vaiñëavas, Dhruva Mahäräja. One has to consider the particular time, country and conveniences. What is convenient in India may not be convenient in the Western countries. Those who are not actually in the line of äcäryas, or who personally have no knowledge of how to act in the role of äcärya, unnecessarily criticize the activities of the ISKCON movement in countries outside of India. The fact is that such critics cannot do anything personally to spread Kåñëa consciousness. If someone does go and preach, taking all risks and allowing all considerations for time and place, it might be that there are changes in the manner of worship, but that is not at all faulty according to çästra. Çrémad Véraräghava Äcärya, an äcärya in the disciplic succession of the Rämänuja-sampradäya, has remarked in his commentary that caëòälas, or conditioned souls who are born in lower than çüdra families, can also be initiated according to circumstances. The formalities may be slightly changed here and there to make them Vaiñëavas."

            "content": "Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu recommends that His name should be heard in every nook and corner of the world. How is this possible unless one preaches everywhere? The cult of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu is bhägavata-dharma, and He especially recommends kåñëa-kathä, or the cult of Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam. He recommends that every Indian, considering this task to be para-upakära, or welfare activity, take the Lord's message to other residents of the world. \"Other residents of the world\" does not refer only to those who are exactly like the Indian brähmaëas and kñatriyas, or like the caste brähmaëas, who claim to be brähmaëas because they were born in the families of brähmaëas. The principle that only Indians and Hindus should be brought into the Vaiñëava cult is a mistaken idea. There should be propaganda to bring everyone to the Vaiñëava cult. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is meant for this purpose. There is no bar to propagating the Kåñëa consciousness movement even among people who are born in caëòäla, mleccha or yavana families. Even in India, this point has been enunciated by Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé in his book Hari-bhakti-viläsa, which is småti and is the authorized Vedic guide for Vaiñëavas in their daily behavior. Sanätana Gosvämé says that as bell metal can turn to gold when mixed with mercury in a chemical process, so, by the bona fide dékñä, or initiation method, anyone can become a Vaiñëava. One should take initiation from a bona fide spiritual master coming in the disciplic succession, who is authorized by his predecessor spiritual master. This is called dékñä-vidhäna. Lord Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä, vyapäçritya: one should accept a spiritual master. By this process the entire world can be converted to Kåñëa consciousness."
