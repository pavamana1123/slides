    "translation": "My dear Lord, You are the topmost of all bestowers of all benediction, the oldest and supreme enjoyer amongst all enjoyers. You are the master of all the worlds' metaphysical philosophy, for You are the supreme cause of all causes, Lord Kåñëa. You are the greatest of all religious principles, the supreme mind, and You have a brain which is never checked by any condition. Therefore I repeatedly offer my obeisances unto You.",

Modern scientists have stopped their brainwork by discovering the theory of uncertainty, but factually for a living being there cannot be any brain activity which is not checked by time and space limitations. A living entity is called aëu, an atomic particle of the supreme soul, and therefore his brain is also atomic. It cannot accommodate unlimited knowledge. This does not mean, however, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, has a limited brain. What Kåñëa says and does is not limited by time and space. In Bhagavad-gétä  the Lord says:"

The great saintly personalities, sages and demigods are able to offer benedictions to ordinary living entities, but they in turn are benedicted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without being benedicted by Kåñëa, one cannot offer benediction to anyone else. The word manave, meaning \"unto the supreme Manu,\" is also significant. The supreme Manu in Vedic literature is Sväyambhuva Manu, who is an incarnation of Kåñëa. All the Manus are empowered incarnations of Kåñëa (manvantara-avatära). There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahmä, 420 in one month, all the Manus are directors of human society, ultimately Kåñëa is the supreme director of human society. In another sense, the word manave indicates the perfection of all kinds of mantras. The mantra delivers the conditioned soul from his bondage; so simply by chanting the mantra Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, one can gain deliverance from any condition."

Because so-called philosophers and scientists are unable to find the real cause, they foolishly say that everything happens by chance. In Brahma-saàhitä Kåñëa is described as the cause of all causes; therefore He is addressed herein as käraëätmane. His very personality is the original cause of everything, the root of everything and the seed of everything. As described in the Vedänta-sütra (1.1.2), janmädy asya yataù:  the Absolute Truth is the supreme cause of all emanations."

Without possessing inconceivable mystic powers, one cannot be accepted as God. In this age of Kali, those who have a little fragmental portion of mystic power claim to be God, but such pseudo Gods can only be accepted as fools, for only Kåñëa is the Supreme Person who possesses all mystic and yogic perfections. The säìkhya-yoga system popular at the present moment was propounded by the atheist Kapila, but the original säìkhya-yoga system was propounded by an incarnation of Kåñëa also named Kapila, the son of Devahüti. Similarly, Dattätreya, another incarnation of Kåñëa, also explained the säìkhya-yoga system. Thus Kåñëa is the origin of all säìkhya-yoga systems and mystic yoga powers."

Another significant word is dharmäya. Since Kåñëa is the original propounder of all kinds of religious principles, it is said: dharmaà tu säkñäd bhagavat-praëétam . No one can introduce a new type of religion, for religion is already there, having been established by Lord Kåñëa. In Bhagavad-gétä Kåñëa informs us of the original dharma and asks us to give up all kinds of religious principles. The real dharma is surrender unto Him. In the Mahäbhärata, it is also said:"
