    "translation": "The Lord's beauty resembles a dark cloud during the rainy season. As the rainfall glistens, His bodily features also glisten. Indeed, He is the sum total of all beauty. The Lord has four arms and an exquisitely beautiful face with eyes like lotus petals, a beautiful highly raised nose, a mind-attracting smile, a beautiful forehead and equally beautiful and fully decorated ears.",

            "content": "After the scorching heat of the summer season, it is very pleasing to see dark clouds in the sky. As confirmed in Brahma-saàhitä: barhävataàsam asitämbuda-sundaräìgam. The Lord wears a peacock feather in His hair, and His bodily complexion is just like a blackish cloud. The word sundara, or snigdha, means \"very pleasing.\" Kandarpa-koöi-kamanéya. Kåñëa's beauty is so pleasing that not even millions upon millions of Cupids can compare to it. The Lord's form as Viñëu is decorated in all opulence; therefore Lord Çiva is trying to see that most opulent form of Näräyaëa, or Viñëu. Generally the worship of the Lord begins with the worship of Näräyaëa, or Viñëu, whereas the worship of Lord Kåñëa and Rädhä is most confidential. Lord Näräyaëa is worshipable by the päïcarätrika-vidhi, or regulative principles, whereas Lord Kåñëa is worshipable by the bhägavata-vidhi. No one can worship the Lord in the bhägavata-vidhi without going through the regulations of the päïcarätrika-vidhi. Actually, neophyte devotees worship the Lord according to the päïcarätrika-vidhi, or the regulative principles enjoined in the Närada-païcarätra. Rädhä-Kåñëa cannot be approached by the neophyte devotees; therefore temple worship according to regulative principles is offered to Lakñmé-Näräyaëa. Although there may be a Rädhä-Kåñëa vigraha, or form, the worship of the neophyte devotees is acceptable as Lakñmé-Näräyaëa worship. Worship according to the päïcarätrika-vidhi is called vidhi-märga, and worship according to the bhägavata-vidhi principles is called räga-märga. The principles of räga-märga are especially meant for devotees who are elevated to the Våndävana platform."

            "content": "The inhabitants of Våndävana—the gopés, mother Yaçodä, Nanda Mahäräja, the cowherd boys, the cows and everyone else—are actually on the räga-märga or bhägavata-märga platform. They participate in five basic rasas-däsya, sakhya, vätsalya, mädhurya and çänta. But although these five rasas are found in the bhägavata-märga, the bhägavata-märga is especially meant for vätsalya and mädhurya, or paternal and conjugal relationships. Yet there is the viçralambha-sakhya, the higher fraternal worship of the Lord especially enjoyed by the cowherd boys. Although there is friendship between Kåñëa and the cowherd boys, this friendship is different from the aiçvarya friendship between Kåñëa and Arjuna. When Arjuna saw the viçva-rüpa, the gigantic universal form of the Lord, he was afraid for having treated Kåñëa as an ordinary friend; therefore he begged Kåñëa's pardon. However, the cowherd boys who are friends of Kåñëa in Våndävana sometimes ride on the shoulders of Kåñëa. They treat Kåñëa equally, just as they treat one another, and they are never afraid of Him, nor do they ever beg His pardon. Thus the räga-märga, or bhägavata-märga, friendship exists on a higher platform with Kåñëa, namely the platform of vipralambha friendship. Paternal friendship, paternal service and conjugal service are visible in the Våndävana räga-märga relationships."

Such persons are called sahajiyä. There are also demons who enjoy depicting Kåñëa and His pastimes with the gopés, taking advantage of Kåñëa by their licentious character. These demons who print books and write lyrics on the räga-märga principles are surely on the way to hell. Unfortunately, they lead others down with them. Devotees in Kåñëa consciousness should be very careful to avoid such demons. One should strictly follow the vidhi-märga regulative principles in the worship of Lakñmé-Näräyaëa, although the Lord is present in the temple as Rädhä-Kåñëa. Rädhä-Kåñëa includes Lakñmé-Näräyaëa; therefore when one worships the Lord according to the regulative principles, the Lord accepts the service in the role of Lakñmé-Näräyaëa. In The Nectar of Devotion full instructions are given about the vidhi-märga worship of Rädhä-Kåñëa, or Lakñmé-Näräyaëa. Although there are sixty-four kinds of offenses one can commit in vidhi-märga worship, in räga-märga worship there is no consideration of such offenses because the devotees on that platform are very much elevated, and there is no question of offense. But if we do not follow the regulative principles on the vidhi-märga platform and keep our eyes trained to spot offenses, we will not make progress."

Those who worship Lord Kåñëa describe Him as sujäta-ruciränanam. In the viñëu-tattva there are hundreds and thousands and millions of forms of the Supreme Lord, but of all these forms, the form of Kåñëa is the most beautiful. Thus for those who worship Kåñëa, the word sujäta-ruciränanam is used."

The hands holding a lotus flower and conchshell are meant for the devotees, whereas the other two hands, holding a disc and mace, or club, are meant for the demons. Actually all of the Lord's arms are auspicious, whether they are holding conchshells and flowers or clubs and discs. The demons killed by Lord Viñëu's cakra disc and club are elevated to the spiritual world, just like the devotees who are protected by the hands holding the lotus flower and conchshell. However, the demons who are elevated to the spiritual world are situated in the impersonal Brahman effulgence, whereas the devotees are allowed to enter into the Vaikuëöha planets. Those who are devotees of Lord Kåñëa are immediately elevated to the Goloka Våndävana planet."

            "content": "The Lord's beauty is compared to rainfall because when the rain falls in the rainy season, it becomes more and more pleasing to the people. After the scorching heat of the summer season, the people enjoy the rainy season very much. Indeed, they even come out of their doors in the villages and enjoy the rainfall directly. Thus the Lord's bodily features are compared to the clouds of the rainy season. The devotees enjoy the Lord's beauty because it is a collection of all kinds of beauties. Therefore the word sarva-saundarya-saìgraham is used. No one can say that the body of the Lord is wanting in beautiful parts. It is completely pürëam. Everything is complete: God's creation, God's beauty and God's bodily features. All these are so complete that all one's desires can become fully satisfied when one sees the beauty of the Lord. The word sarva-saundarya indicates that there are different types of beauties in the material and spiritual worlds and that the Lord contains all of them. Both materialists and spiritualists can enjoy the beauty of the Lord. Because the Supreme Lord attracts everyone, including demons and devotees, materialists and spiritualists, He is called Kåñëa. Similarly, His devotees also attract everyone. As mentioned in the Sad-gosvämé-stotra: dhérädhéra-jana-priyau—the Gosvämés are equally dear to the dhéra (devotees) and adhéra (demons). Lord Kåñëa was not very pleasing to the demons when He was present in Våndävana, but the six Gosvämés were pleasing to the demons when they were present in Våndävana. That is the beauty of the Lord's dealings with His devotees; sometimes the Lord gives more credit to His devotees than He takes for Himself. For instance, on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, Lord Kåñëa fought simply by giving directions. Yet it was Arjuna who took the credit for fighting. Nimitta-mätraà bhava savyasäcin: \"You, O Savyasäcé [Arjuna], can be but an instrument in the fight.\"  Everything was arranged by the Lord, but the credit of victory was given to Arjuna. Similarly, in the Kåñëa consciousness movement, everything is happening according to the predictions of Lord Caitanya, but the credit goes to Lord Caitanya's sincere servants. Thus the Lord is described herein as sarva-saundarya-saìgraham."
