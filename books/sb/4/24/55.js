            "content": "The word satäm refers to transcendentalists. There are three kinds of transcendentalists: the jïäné, yogé and bhakta. Out of these three, the bhakta is selected as the most suitable candidate to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is emphasized herein that only one who is outside devotional service would not engage in searching for the lotus feet of the Lord. Foolish people sometimes maintain that God may be attained in any way—either by karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, dhyäna-yoga, etc.—but here it is clearly stated that it is impossible to obtain the mercy of the Lord by any means but bhakti-yoga. The word durärädhya is especially significant. It is very difficult to attain the lotus feet of the Lord by any method other than bhakti-yoga."
