    "translation": "The great sage Vidura continued: O best of the brähmaëas, it is very difficult for living entities encaged within this material body to have personal contact with Lord Çiva. Even great sages who have no material attachments do not contact him, despite their always being absorbed in meditation to attain his personal contact.",

However, Lord Çiva does descend on a special occasion when he is ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard, it is stated in the Padma Puräëa that Lord Çiva appeared as a brähmaëa in the age of Kali to preach the Mäyäväda philosophy, which is nothing but a type of Buddhist philosophy. It is stated in Padma Puräëa:"

            "content": "Lord Çiva, speaking to Pärvaté-devé, foretold that he would spread the Mäyäväda philosophy in the guise of a sannyäsé brähmaëa just to eradicate Buddhist philosophy. This sannyäsé was Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya. In order to overcome the effects of Buddhist philosophy and spread Vedänta philosophy, Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya had to make some compromise with the Buddhist philosophy, and as such he preached the philosophy of monism, for it was required at that time. Otherwise there was no need for his preaching Mäyäväda philosophy. At the present moment there is no need for Mäyäväda philosophy or Buddhist philosophy, and Lord Caitanya rejected both of them. This Kåñëa consciousness movement is spreading the philosophy of Lord Caitanya and rejecting the philosophy of both classes of Mäyävädé. Strictly speaking, both Buddhist philosophy and Çaìkara's philosophy are but different types of Mäyäväda dealing on the platform of material existence. Neither of these philosophies has spiritual significance. There is spiritual significance only after one accepts the philosophy of Bhagavad-gétä, which culminates in surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally people worship Lord Çiva for some material benefit, and although they cannot see him personally, they derive great material profit by worshiping him."
