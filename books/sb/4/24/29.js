    "translation": "A person who executes his occupational duty properly for one hundred births becomes qualified to occupy the post of Brahmä, and if he becomes more qualified, he can approach Lord Çiva. A person who is directly surrendered to Lord Kåñëa, or Viñëu, in unalloyed devotional service is immediately promoted to the spiritual planets. Lord Çiva and other demigods attain these planets after the destruction of this material world.",

Let us begin tracing the evolutionary process from the point of devastation (pralaya), when the whole universe is filled with water. At that time there are many fishes and other aquatics, and from these aquatics evolve creepers, trees, etc. From these, insects and reptiles evolve, and from them birds, beasts and then human beings and finally civilized human beings. Now, the civilized human being is at a junction where he can make further evolutionary progress in spiritual life. Here it is stated (sva-dharma-niñöhaù) that when a living entity comes to a civilized form of life, there must be sva-dharma, social divisions according to one's work and qualifications. This is indicated in Bhagavad-gétä :"

            "content": "In civilized human society there must be the divisions of brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra, and everyone must properly execute his occupational duty in accordance with his division. Here it is described (svadharma-niñöhaù) that it does not matter whether one is a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra. If one sticks to his position and properly executes his particular duty, he is considered a civilized human being. Otherwise he is no better than an animal. It is also mentioned herein that whoever executes his occupational duty (sva-dharma) for one hundred births (for instance, if a brähmaëa continues to act as a brähmaëa) becomes eligible for promotion to Brahmaloka, the planet where Lord Brahmä lives. There is also a planet called Çivaloka, or Sadäçivaloka, which is situated in a marginal position between the spiritual and material worlds. If, after being situated in Brahmaloka, one becomes more qualified, he is promoted to Sadäçivaloka. Similarly, when one becomes even more qualified, he can attain the Vaikuëöhalokas. The Vaikuëöhalokas are targets for everyone, even the demigods, and they can be attained by a devotee who has no desire for material benefit. As indicated in Bhagavad-gétä . A devotee who is fully in Kåñëa consciousness, who is not attracted by any other loka, or planet, including Brahmaloka and Çivaloka, is immediately transferred to Kåñëaloka (mäm eti). That is the highest perfection of life and the perfection of the evolutionary process."
