In Våndävana there is Lord Çiva's temple called Gopéçvara. The gopés used to worship not only Lord Çiva but Kätyäyané, or Durgä, as well, but their aim was to attain the favor of Lord Kåñëa. A devotee of Lord Kåñëa does not disrespect Lord Çiva, but worships Lord Çiva as the most exalted devotee of Lord Kåñëa. Consequently whenever a devotee worships Lord Çiva, he prays to Lord Çiva to achieve the favor of Kåñëa, and he does not request material profit. In Bhagavad-gétä  it is said that generally people worship demigods for some material profit. Kämais tais tair håta jïänäù. Driven by material lust, they worship demigods, but a devotee never does so, for he is never driven by material lust. That is the difference between a devotee's respect for Lord Çiva and an asura's respect for him. The asura worships Lord Çiva, takes some benediction from him, misuses the benediction and ultimately is killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who awards him liberation."

            "content": "Because Lord Çiva is a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he loves all the devotees of the Supreme Lord. Lord Çiva told the Pracetäs that because they were devotees of the Lord, he loved them very much. Lord Çiva was not kind and merciful only to the Pracetäs; anyone who is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very dear to Lord Çiva. Not only are the devotees dear to Lord Çiva, but he respects them as much as he respects the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, devotees of the Supreme Lord also worship Lord Çiva as the most dear devotee of Lord Kåñëa. They do not worship him as a separate Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the list of näma-aparädhas that it is an offense to think that the chanting of the name of Hari and the chanting of Hara, or Çiva, are the same. The devotees must always know that Lord Viñëu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that Lord Çiva is His devotee. A devotee should be offered respect on the level of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and sometimes even more respect. Indeed, Lord Räma, the Personality of Godhead Himself, sometimes worshiped Lord Çiva. If a devotee is worshiped by the Lord, why should a devotee not be worshiped by other devotees on the same level with the Lord? This is the conclusion. From this verse it appears that Lord Çiva blesses the asuras simply for the sake of formality. Actually he loves one who is devoted to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
