    "translation": "The three sons of Mahäräja Antardhäna were named Pävaka, Pavamäna and Çuci. Formerly these three personalities were the demigods of fire, but due to the curse of the great sage Vasiñöha, they became the sons of Mahäräja Antardhäna. As such, they were as powerful as the fire-gods, and they attained the destination of mystic yoga power, being again situated as the demigods of fire.",

            "content": "In the Bhagavad-gétä  it is stated that one who falls down from yoga practice is elevated to the heavenly planets, and after enjoying the material facilities there he again comes down to the earthly planet and takes birth in a very rich family or a very pious brähmaëa family. Thus it is to be understood that when demigods fall down, they come to earth as sons of very rich and pious families. In such families, the living entity gets an opportunity to execute Kåñëa consciousness and thereby gain promotion to his desired goal. The sons of Mahäräja Antardhäna had been the demigods in charge of fire, and they regained their former position and by mystic power returned to the heavenly planets."
