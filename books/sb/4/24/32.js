He personally chanted the mantra so that the mantra would be more powerful, and he advised that the mantra be chanted by the King's sons (räja-putras). When a mantra is chanted by a great devotee, the mantra becomes more powerful. Although the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra is powerful in itself, a disciple upon initiation receives the mantra from his spiritual master, for when the mantra is chanted by the spiritual master, it becomes more powerful. Lord Çiva advised the sons of the King to hear him attentively, for inattentive hearing is offensive."
