            "content": "In this verse sädhavaù (meaning \"pious\" or \"well behaved\") is very important, especially at the present moment. It is derived from the word sädhu. A perfect sädhu is one who is always engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Präcénabarhi's sons are described as sädhavaù because of their complete obedience to their father. The father, king and spiritual master are supposed to be representatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such they have to be respected as the Supreme Lord. It is the duty of the father, the spiritual master and the king to regulate their subordinates in such a way that they ultimately become fully unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Lord. That is the duty of the superiors, and it is the duty of the subordinates to obey their orders perfectly and in a disciplined way. The word çirasä (\"on their heads\") is also significant, for the Pracetäs accepted the orders of their father and carried them on their heads, which means they accepted them in complete surrender."
