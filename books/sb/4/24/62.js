    "translation": "My dear Lord, Your universal form consists of all five elements, the senses, mind, intelligence, false ego (which is material) and the Paramätmä, Your partial expansion, who is the director of everything. Yogis other than the devotees—namely the karma-yogé and jïäna-yogé—worship You by their respective actions in their respective positions. It is stated both in the Vedas and in the çästras that are corollaries of the Vedas, and indeed everywhere, that it is only You who are to be worshiped. That is the expert version of all the Vedas.",

In the Second Canto, Third Chapter, of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, it is stated that those who desire material benefits are recommended to worship different types of demigods, and in conclusion the Bhägavatam recommends:"

Even when one performs yajïas, as stated here (kriyä-kaläpaiù), he should always remember that the demigods are but agents of the Supreme Lord. Actually the worshipful Lord is Viñëu, Yajïeçvara.

The word kovidäù is very significant, for it indicates the devotees of the Lord. Only the devotees know perfectly that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, is all-pervading. Within the material energy, He is represented by the five material elements as well as the mind, intelligence and ego. He is also represented by another energy—the living entities—and all these manifestations in the spiritual and material world combined are but representations of the different energies of the Lord. The conclusion is that the Lord is one and that He is expanded in everything. This is understood by the Vedic version: sarvaà khalv idaà brahma. One who knows this concentrates all his energy in worshiping Lord Viñëu."
