Simply by offering prayers to the Supreme Lord one can become perfect, even though engaged in his occupational duty. The real purpose of life is to become a devotee of the Lord. It does not matter where one is situated. Whether one is a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya, çüdra, American, Englishman, Indian, etc., one can execute devotional service anywhere and everywhere in the material existence simply by offering prayers unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra is also a prayer, for a prayer addresses the Supreme Personality of Godhead by His name and invokes good fortune by petitioning the Lord to allow one to engage in His devotional service. The Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra also says, \"My dear Lord Kåñëa, my dear Lord Räma, O energy of the Lord, Hare, kindly engage me in Your service.\" Although one may be situated in a lowly position, he can execute devotional service under any circumstance, as stated, ahaituky apratihatä: \"Devotional service cannot be checked by any material condition.\"  Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu also recommended this process:"
