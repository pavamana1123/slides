    "translation": "The Pracetäs were fortunate to see Lord Çiva, the chief of the demigods, emerging from the water with his associates. His bodily luster was just like molten gold, his throat was bluish, and he had three eyes, which looked very mercifully upon his devotees. He was accompanied by many musicians, who were glorifying him. As soon as the Pracetäs saw Lord Çiva, they immediately offered their obeisances in great amazement and fell down at the lotus feet of the lord.",

            "content": "The word vibudhänugaiù indicates that Lord Çiva is always accompanied by the denizens of the higher planets known as Gandharvas and Kinnaras. They are very expert in musical science, and Lord Çiva is worshiped by them constantly. In pictures, Lord Çiva is generally painted white, but here we find that the color of his skin is not exactly white but like molten gold, or a glowing yellowish color. Because Lord Çiva is always very, very merciful, his name is Äçutoña. Amongst all the demigods, Lord Çiva can be pacified even by the lowest class of men, who need only offer him obeisances and leaves of a bael tree. Thus his name is Äçutoña, which means that he is pleased very quickly."

            "content": "Generally those who are very fond of material prosperity approach Lord Çiva for such benediction. The lord, being very merciful, quickly awards all the blessings the devotee asks of him. The demons take advantage of this leniency and sometimes take benedictions from Lord Çiva which can be very dangerous to others. For instance, Våkäsura took a benediction from Lord Çiva by which he could kill everyone he touched on the head. Although Lord Çiva sometimes very liberally gives such benedictions to his devotees, the difficulty is that the demons, being very cunning, sometimes want to experiment improperly with such benedictions. For instance, after receiving his benediction, Våkäsura tried to touch the head of Lord Çiva. Devotees of Lord Viñëu, however, have no desire for such benedictions, and Lord Viñëu does not give His devotees benedictions which would cause disturbance to the whole world."
