Although Lord Brahmä has a long life-span (4,320,000,000 years constitute twelve hours in a day of Brahmä), Brahmä is afraid of death and consequently engages in the devotional service of the Lord. Similarly, all the Manus who appear and disappear during the day of Brahmä are also engaged in the Lord's devotional service. In Brahmä's one day, fourteen Manus appear and disappear. The first Manu is Sväyambhuva Manu. Each Manu lives for seventy-one yugas, each consisting of some 4,320,000 years. Although the Manus have such a long life-span, they still prepare for the next life by engaging in the devotional service of the Lord. In this age human beings only live for sixty or eighty years, and even this small life-span is gradually decreasing. Therefore it is even more imperative for human beings to take to the worship of the lotus feet of the Lord by constantly chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra, as recommended by Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu."

This is not new in this present age, for even in the days of yore Prahläda Mahäräja, who was engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, was harassed by his demoniac father, Hiraëyakaçipu. The atheists are always prepared to harass a devotee; therefore Caitanya Mahäprabhu suggested that one be very tolerant of these people. Nonetheless, one has to continue chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra and preaching the chanting of this mantra because such preaching and chanting constitute the perfection of life. One should chant and preach about the urgency of making this life perfect in all respects. One should thus engage in the devotional service of the Lord and follow in the footsteps of previous äcäryas, beginning with Lord Brahmä and others."
