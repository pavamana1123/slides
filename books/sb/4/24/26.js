            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, or Kåñëa, is known as bhakta-vatsala, and herein we find Lord Çiva described as dharma-vatsala. Of course, the word dharma-vatsala refers to a person who lives according to religious principles. That is understood. Nonetheless, these two words have additional significance. Sometimes Lord Çiva has to deal with persons who are in the modes of passion and ignorance. Such persons are not always very much religious and pious in their activities, but since they worship Lord Çiva for some material profit, they sometimes obey the religious principles. As soon as Lord Çiva sees that his devotees are following religious principles, he blesses them. The Pracetäs, sons of Präcénabarhi, were naturally very pious and gentle, and consequently Lord Çiva was immediately pleased with them. Lord Çiva could understand that the princes were sons of Vaiñëavas, and as such Lord Çiva offered prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead as follows."
