            "content": "Lord Brahmä was created by Lord Viñëu; then Lord Brahmä created Lord Çiva and other great sages, headed by Bhågu Muni. These great sages included Bhågu, Maréci, Ätreya, Vasiñöha and others. All these great sages were in charge of creating population. Since there were not very many living entities in the beginning, Viñëu entrusted Brahmä with the business of creation, and Brahmä in his turn created many hundreds and thousands of demigods and great sages to continue with the creation. At the same time, Lord Brahmä cautioned all his sons and disciples by reciting the prayers now recited by Lord Çiva. The material creation means material engagement, but material engagements can be counteracted if we always remember our relationship with the Lord as that relationship is described in these prayers recited by Lord Çiva. In this way we can remain constantly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus despite our engagement in the creation, we cannot be deviated from the path of Kåñëa consciousness. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is especially meant for this purpose. In this material world everyone is engaged in some particular occupational duty which is prescribed in the varëäçrama-dharma. Brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas, çüdras and everyone are engaged in their occupational duty, but if one remembers his first duty—keeping in constant contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead—everything will be successful. If one simply executes the rules and regulations of the varëäçrama-dharma in the role of a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra and keeps busy and does not remember one's eternal relationship with the Lord, one's business and activities as well as occupational duties will simply be a waste of time. This is confirmed in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"
