After the death of Mahäräja Påthu, his eldest son, Vijitäçva, became emperor of the world. King Vijitäçva was very affectionate toward his younger brothers, and therefore he wanted them to rule different directions of the world. From time immemorial the eldest son generally becomes king after the death of the previous king. When the Päëòavas ruled the earth, Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, the eldest son of King Päëòu, became emperor, and his younger brothers assisted him. Similarly, King Vijitäçva's younger brothers were appointed to govern the different directions of the world."
