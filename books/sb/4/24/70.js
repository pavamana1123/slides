Kértanéyaù sadä hariù:  \"The holy name of the Lord should be chanted twenty-four hours daily.\" Therefore in this Kåñëa consciousness movement we request the devotees to chant at least sixteen rounds on their beads daily. Actually one has to chant twenty-four hours daily, just like Öhäkura Haridäsa, who was chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra three hundred thousand times daily. Indeed, he had no other business. Some of the Gosvämés, like Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé, were also chanting very rigidly and also offering obeisances very rigidly. As stated in Çréniväsäcärya's prayer to the six Gosvämés (Ñaò-gosvämy-añöaka): saìkhyä-pürvaka-näma-gäna-natibhiù kälävasäné-kåtau. The word saìkhyä-pürvaka means \"maintaining a numerical strength.\" Not only was Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé chanting the holy name of the Lord, but he was also offering obeisances in the same prolific numbers."

            "content": "Because the princes were ready to enter into some severe austerity in order to worship the Lord, Lord Çiva advised them to constantly chant of and meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is significant that Lord Çiva personally offered his prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead just as he was taught by his father, Lord Brahmä. Similarly, he was also preaching to the princes according to the paramparä system. One not only should practice the instructions received from the spiritual master but should also distribute this knowledge to one's disciples."

            "content": "The words ätmänam ätma-sthaà sarva-bhüteñv avasthitam are also significant. The Personality of Godhead is the origin of all living entities. Because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, He is the father of all of them. One can search out the Supreme Lord very easily within one's heart, for He is situated in every living entity's heart. In this verse the process of worshiping the Lord is considered to be very easy and complete, for anyone can sit down anywhere and in any condition of life and simply chant the holy names of the Lord. By chanting and hearing, one automatically engages in meditation."
