These authorities are Svayambhü, Närada, Çambhu, Kumära, Kapila, Manu, Prahläda, Janaka, Bhéñma, Bali, Vaiyäsaki, or Çukadeva Gosvämé, and Yamaräja. The impersonalists, who generally worship Lord Çiva, should learn of the transcendental sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1) of the Lord. Here Lord Çiva kindly describes the details of the Lord's bodily features. Thus the impersonalists' argument that the Lord has no form cannot be accepted under any circumstance."
