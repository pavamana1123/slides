The void of the impersonalists, which has no variegatedness, is not at all pleasing compared with such a scene. Actually one has to attain the perfection of sac-cid-änanda (BS 5.1), eternity, bliss and knowledge. Because the impersonalists deny these varieties of creation, they cannot actually enjoy transcendental bliss. The place where the Pracetäs arrived was the abode of Lord Çiva. Impersonalists are generally worshipers of Lord Çiva, but Lord Çiva is never without variety in his abode. Thus wherever one goes, whether to the planet of Lord Çiva, Lord Viñëu or Lord Brahmä, there is variety to be enjoyed by persons full in knowledge and bliss."
