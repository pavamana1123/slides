    "translation": "My dear Lord, the king in charge of the heavenly kingdom is also desirous of obtaining the ultimate goal of life-devotional service. Similarly, You are the ultimate destination of those who identify themselves with You [ahaà brahmäsmi]. However, it is very difficult for them to attain You, whereas a devotee can very easily attain Your Lordship.",

This indicates that it is very difficult for one to attain the ultimate goal of life and reach the supreme destination, Vaikuëöhaloka or Goloka Våndävana, simply by studying Vedänta philosophy or Vedic literature. However, this highest perfectional stage can be attained by the devotees very easily. That is the meaning of vedeñu durlabham adurlabham ätma-bhaktau. The same point is confirmed by Lord Çiva in this verse. The Lord is very difficult for the karma-yogés, jïäna-yogés and dhyäna-yogés to attain. Those who are bhakti-yogés, however, have no difficulty at all. In the word sväräjyasya, svar refers to Svargaloka, the heavenly planet, and sväräjya refers to the ruler of the heavenly planet, Indra. Generally, karmés desire elevation to heavenly planets, but King Indra desires to become perfect in bhakti-yoga. Those who identify themselves as ahaà brahmäsmi (\"I am the Supreme Brahman, one with the Absolute Truth\") also ultimately desire to attain perfect liberation in the Vaikuëöha planets or Goloka Våndävana. In Bhagavad-gétä  it is said:"

Simply by practicing bhakti-yoga one can understand the Supreme Lord in truth, but without such understanding, one cannot enter the spiritual kingdom. One may be elevated to the heavenly planets or may realize himself as Brahman (ahaà brahmäsmi), but that is not the end of realization. One must realize the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by bhakti-yoga; then real perfection of life is attained."
