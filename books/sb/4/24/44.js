We have various senses—the powers of seeing, tasting, smelling, touching, etc.—and all the propensities of our senses can be satisfied when the senses are engaged in the service of the Lord. Håñékeëa håñékeça-sevanaà bhaktir ucyate: \"Bhakti means engaging all the senses in the service of the master of the senses, Håñékeça.\" (Närada-païcarätra) These material senses, however, cannot be engaged in the service of the Lord; therefore one has to become free from all designations. Sarvopädhi-vinirmuktaà tatparatvena nirmalam . One has to become free from all designation or false egotism and thus become purified. When we engage our senses in the service of the Lord, the desires or the inclinations of the senses can be perfectly fulfilled. Lord Çiva therefore wants to see the Lord in a form which is inconceivable to the Bauddha philosophers, or the Buddhists."

            "content": "The impersonalists and the voidists also have to see the form of the Absolute. In Buddhist temples there are forms of Lord Buddha in meditation, but these are not worshiped like the forms of the Lord in Vaiñëava temples (forms like Rädhä-Kåñëa, Sétä-Räma or Lakñmé-Näräyaëa). Amongst the different sampradäyas (Vaiñëava sects) either Rädhä-Kåñëa or Lakñmé-Näräyaëa is worshiped. Lord Çiva wants to see that form perfectly, just as the devotees want to see it. The words rüpaà priyatamaà svänäm are specifically mentioned here, indicating that Lord Çiva wants to see that form which is very dear to the devotees. The word svänäm is especially significant because only the devotees are very, very dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The jïänés, yogés and karmés are not particularly dear, for the karmés simply want to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their order supplier. The jïänés want to see Him to become one with Him, and the yogés want to see Him partially represented within their heart as Paramätmä, but the bhaktas, or the devotees, want to see Him in His complete perfection. As stated in Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38):"

The conclusion is that Lord Çiva wants to see Him in complete perfection and not in the impersonalist or voidist way. Although the Lord is one in His various forms (advaitam acyutam anädim), still His form as the young enjoyer of the gopés and companion of the cowherd boys (kiçora-mürti) is the most perfect form. Thus Vaiñëavas accept the form of the Lord in His Våndävana pastimes as the chief form."
