    "translation": "Lord Çiva, the most powerful demigod, second only to Lord Viñëu, is self-sufficient. Although he has nothing to aspire for in the material world, for the benefit of those in the material world he is always busily engaged everywhere and is accompanied by his dangerous energies like goddess Kälé and goddess Durgä.",

Consequently, Lord Çiva has a Vaiñëava sampradäya, the disciplic succession known as the Rudra-sampradäya. Just as there is a Brahma-sampradäya coming directly from Lord Brahmä, the Rudra-sampradäya comes directly from Lord Çiva. Lord Çiva is one of the twelve great personalities, as stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

His disciplic succession is also known as the Viñëu Svämé-sampradäya, and the current Viñëu Svämé-sampradäya is also known as the Vallabha-sampradäya. The current Brahma-sampradäya is known as the Madhva-Gauòéya-sampradäya. Even though Lord Çiva appeared to preach Mäyäväda philosophy, at the end of his pastime in the form of Çaìkaräcärya, he preached the Vaiñëava philosophy: bhaja govindaà bhaja govindaà bhaja govindaà müòha-mate. He stressed worshiping Lord Kåñëa, or Govinda, three times in this verse and especially warned his followers that they could not possibly achieve deliverance, or mukti, simply by word jugglery and grammatical puzzles. If one is actually serious to attain mukti, he must worship Lord Kåñëa. That is Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya's last instruction."

Material energy—goddess Durgä, or goddess Kälé—is always under his control. Goddess Kälé and Durgä serve him by killing all the asuras, or demons. Sometimes Kälé becomes so infuriated that she indiscriminately kills all kinds of asuras. There is a popular picture of goddess Kälé in which she wears a garland composed of the heads of the asuras and holds in her left hand a captured head and in her right hand a great khaòga, or chopper, for killing asuras. Great wars are symbolic representations of Kälé's devastation of the asuras and are actually conducted by the goddess Kälé."

Asuras do not know the secret of the energy of Lord Çiva, and they prefer to worship goddess Kälé or Durgä or Lord Çiva for material benefit. Due to their demoniac character, they are reluctant to surrender to Lord Kåñëa, as indicated by Bhagavad-gétä :"

In another popular picture the goddess Kälé is sometimes seen standing on the prostrate body of Lord Çiva, which indicates that sometimes Lord Çiva has to fall down flat in order to stop goddess Kälé from killing the asuras. Since Lord Çiva controls the great material energy (goddess Durgä), worshipers of Lord Çiva attain very opulent positions within this material world. Under Lord Çiva's direction, a worshiper of Lord Çiva gets all kinds of material facilities. In contrast, a Vaiñëava, or worshiper of Lord Viñëu, gradually becomes poorer in material possessions because Lord Viñëu does not trick His devotees into becoming materially entangled by possessions. Lord Viñëu gives His devotees intelligence from within, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä :"

His potency, the goddess Durgä, is described as keeping all living entities in the darkness of ignorance (yä devé sarva-bhüteñu nidra-rüpaà saàsthitä). Both Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva are incarnations of Lord Viñëu, but Lord Brahmä is in charge of the creation whereas Lord Çiva is in charge of the destruction, which he carries out with the help of his material energy, goddess Kälé, or goddess Durgä. Thus in this verse Lord Çiva is described as being accompanied by dangerous potencies (çaktyä ghorayä), and that is the actual position of Lord Çiva."
