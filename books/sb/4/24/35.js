    "translation": "My dear Lord, You are the origin of the subtle material ingredients, the master of all integration as well as the master of all disintegration, the predominating Deity named Saìkarñaëa, and the master of all intelligence, known as the predominating Deity Pradyumna. Therefore, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",

            "content": "The whole universe is maintained by the integrating power of the Supreme Lord, who is known in that capacity by the name Saìkarñaëa. The material scientists may have discovered the law of gravity, which maintains the integration of objects within the material energy, yet the master of all integration can create devastation by the disintegrating blazing fire emanating from His mouth. A description of this can be found in the Eleventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, wherein the universal form of the Lord is described. The master of integration is also the destroyer of this world by virtue of His disintegrating energy. Saìkarñaëa is the master of integration and disintegration, whereas Pradyumna, another feature of Lord Väsudeva, is responsible for universal growth and maintenance. The word sükñmäya is significant because within this gross material body there are subtle material bodies—namely mind, intelligence and ego. The Lord in His different features (Väsudeva, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Saìkarñaëa) maintains both the gross and subtle material elements of this world. As mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä, the gross material elements are earth, water, fire, air and ether, and the subtle material elements are mind, intelligence and ego. All of them are controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Väsudeva, Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, and this will be further explained in the following verse."
