            "content": "As stated in the previous verse (kriyä-käëòeñu niñëätaù), Mahäräja Barhiñat dived very deeply into the fruitive activities of sacrifice. This means that as soon as he finished one yajïa in one place, he began performing another yajïa in the immediate vicinity. At the present moment there is a similar need to perform saìkértana-yajïa all over the world. The Kåñëa consciousness movement has started performing saìkértana-yajïa in different places, and it has been experienced that wherever saìkértana-yajïa is performed, many thousands of people gather and take part in it. Imperceptible auspiciousness achieved in this connection should be continued all over the world. The members of the Kåñëa consciousness movement should perform saìkértana-yajïas one after another, so much that all the people of the world will either jokingly or seriously chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, and thus they will derive the benefit of cleansing the heart. The holy name of the Lord (harer näma ) is so powerful that whether it is chanted jokingly or seriously the effect of vibrating this transcendental sound will be equally distributed. It is not possible at the present moment to perform repeated yajïas as Mahäräja Barhiñat performed, but it is within our means to perform saìkértana-yajïa, which does not cost anything. One can sit down anywhere and chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. If the surface of the globe is overflooded with the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra, the people of the world will be very, very happy."
