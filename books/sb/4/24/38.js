Lord Çiva prays to Lord Aniruddha to give him strength so that he will not taste anything but the prasäda of the Lord. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has sung a verse indicating that the tongue is the most formidable enemy among all the senses. If one can control the tongue, he can easily control the other senses. The tongue can be controlled only by eating prasäda offered to the Deity. Lord Çiva's prayer to Lord Aniruddha is meant for this purpose (tåpti-däya); he prays to Lord Aniruddha to help him be satisfied by eating only prasäda offered to the Lord."
