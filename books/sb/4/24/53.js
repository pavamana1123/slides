            "content": "It is said that the transcendental name, form, pastimes and entourage of the Lord cannot be appreciated by the blunt material senses; therefore one has to engage himself in devotional service so that the senses may be purified and one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here, however, it is indicated that those who are constantly engaged in meditating on the lotus feet of the Lord are certainly purified of the material contamination of the senses and are thus able to see the Supreme Lord face to face. The word \"meditation\" is very popular in this age amongst the common people, but they do not know the actual meaning of meditation. However, from Vedic literature we learn that the yogés are always absorbed in meditation upon the lotus feet of the Lord. Dhyänävasthita-tad-gatena manasä paçyanti yaà yoginaù . This is the real business of the yogés: to think of the lotus feet of the Lord. Lord Çiva therefore advises that one who is actually serious about purification must engage himself in this type of meditation or in the mystic yoga system, which will help him not only to see the Lord within constantly but to see Him face to face and become His associate in Vaikuëöhaloka or Goloka Våndävana."

            "content": "The word sva-dharmam (as in sva-dharmam anutiñöhatäm) indicates that the system of varëäçrama—which indicates the occupational duties of the brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra and which is the perfect institution for humanity—must be supported by bhakti-yoga if one at all wants security in life. Generally people think that simply by executing the occupational duties of a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra or the duty of a brahmacäré, gåhastha, vänaprastha or sannyäsé one becomes fearless or securely attains liberation, but factually unless all these occupational duties are accompanied by bhakti-yoga, one cannot become fearless. In Bhagavad-gétä there are descriptions of karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, bhakti-yoga, dhyäna-yoga, etc., but unless one comes to the point of bhakti-yoga, these other yogas cannot help one attain the highest perfection of life. In other words, bhakti-yoga is the only means for liberation. We find this conclusion also in Caitanya-caritämåta in a discussion between Lord Caitanya and Rämänanda Räya regarding a human being's liberation from this material world. In that discussion Rämänanda Räya referred to the execution of varëäçrama-dharma, and Lord Caitanya indicated that the varëäçrama-dharma was simply external (eho bähya). Lord Caitanya wanted to impress upon Rämänanda Räya that simply by executing the duties of varëäçrama-dharma one is not guaranteed liberation. Finally Rämänanda Räya referred to the process of bhakti-yoga: sthäne sthitäù çruti-gatäà tanu-väì-manobhiù . Regardless of one's condition of life, if he practices bhakti-yoga, which begins with hearing (çruti-gatäm) the transcendental messages of the Lord through the mouths of devotees, he gradually conquers the unconquerable God."

            "content": "God is known to be unconquerable, but one who submissively hears the words of a self-realized soul conquers the unconquerable. The conclusion is that if one is serious about liberation, he not only should execute the occupational duties of varëäçrama-dharma but should also engage in bhakti-yoga by beginning hearing from a realized soul. This process will help the devotee conquer the unconquerable Supreme Personality of Godhead and become His associate after giving up the material body."
