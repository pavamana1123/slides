            "content": "It is especially significant that Lord Çiva is a pure devotee of Lord Väsudeva. Vaiñëavänäà yathä çambhuù: \"Amongst all Vaiñëavas, Lord Çiva is the topmost.\" Consequently Lord Çiva has a sampradäya, a Vaiñëava disciplic succession, called the Rudra-sampradäya. At the present moment those who belong to the Viñëu Svämé-sampradäya of Vaiñëavas come from Rudra, Lord Çiva. To become a devotee of Lord Kåñëa, Väsudeva, is very, very difficult. The word especially used in this connection is durärädhyam. The worship of the demigods is not very difficult, but becoming a devotee of Lord Väsudeva, Kåñëa, is not so easy. However, if one adheres to the principles and follows in the footsteps of the higher authorities, as advised by Lord Çiva, one can easily become a devotee of Lord Väsudeva. This is also confirmed by Prahläda Mahäräja. Devotional service cannot be practiced by a mental speculator. Devotional service is a special attainment which can be acquired only by a person who has surrendered unto a pure devotee. As confirmed by Prahläda Mahäräja, mahéyasäà päda-rajo-'bhiñekaà niñkiïcanänäà na våëéta yävat: \"Unless one accepts the dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee, who is free from all material contamination, one cannot enter into the devotional service of the Lord.\" "
