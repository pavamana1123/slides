At the meeting of Naimiñäraëya, where Süta Gosvämé spoke Çrémad-Bhägavatam to all the great sages, Süta Gosvämé was also asked about the talks between Mahäräja Parékñit and Çukadeva Gosvämé, for the sages believed that the talks between Çukadeva Gosvämé and Mahäräja Parékñit must have been as important as the talks between Lord Kåñëa and Arjuna. As everyone is still eager to learn the subject of Bhagavad-gétä in order to become perfectly enlightened, Vidura was similarly eager to learn from the great sage Maitreya about the talks between Lord Çiva and the Pracetäs."
