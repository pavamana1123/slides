Indra was not visible to others when he was stealing the horse, but Mahäräja Påthu's son Vijitäçva could see him. Yet despite his knowing that Indra was taking away his father's horse, Vijitäçva did not attack him. This indicates that Mahäräja Vijitäçva respected the right persons. Although Indra was stealing the horse from his father, Vijitäçva knew perfectly well that Indra was not an ordinary thief. Since Indra was a great and powerful demigod and servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vijitäçva purposefully excused him due to sentiment only, even though Indra was acting wrongly. Thus Indra became very pleased with Vijitäçva at that time. The demigods have the great mystic power of being able to appear and disappear according to their will, and since Indra was very pleased with Vijitäçva, he bestowed this mystic power upon him. Thus Vijitäçva became known as Antardhäna."
