            "content": "Lord Çiva is rarely seen by common men, and similarly a person who is fully surrendered unto Väsudeva, Kåñëa, is also very rarely seen because a person who is fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord is very rare (sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù). Consequently Lord Çiva came especially to see the Pracetäs because they were fully surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva. Väsudeva is also mentioned in the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam in the mantra, oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya. Since Väsudeva is the ultimate truth, Lord Çiva openly proclaims that one who is a devotee of Lord Väsudeva, who is surrendered to Lord Kåñëa, is actually very dear to him. Lord Väsudeva, Kåñëa, is worshipable not only by ordinary living entities but by demigods like Lord Çiva, Lord Brahmä and others. Yaà brahmä-varuëendra-rudra-marutaù stuvanti divyaiù stavaiù . Kåñëa is worshiped by Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva, Varuëa, Indra, Candra and all other demigods. That is also the situation with a devotee. Indeed, one who takes to Kåñëa consciousness immediately becomes very dear to anyone who is simply finding out and beginning to understand what Kåñëa consciousness actually is. Similarly, all the demigods are also trying to find out who is actually surrendered to Lord Väsudeva. Because the Pracetä princes were surrendered to Väsudeva, Lord Çiva willingly came forth to see them."

Indeed, he struggles so hard to enjoy himself that he cannot even enjoy the material resources. Thus he is sometimes called prakåti, or jéva, for he is situated in the marginal potency. When the living entity is covered with the three modes of material nature, he is called jéva-saàjïita. There are two kinds of living entities: one is called kñara, and the other is akñara. Kñara refers to those who have fallen down and become conditioned, and akñara refers to those who are not conditioned. The vast majority of living entities live in the spiritual world and are called akñara. They are in the position of Brahman, pure spiritual existence. They are different from those who have been conditioned by the three modes of material nature."

            "content": "Being above both the kñara and akñara, Lord Kåñëa, Väsudeva, is described in Bhagavad-gétä : sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja. The word säkñät, meaning \"directly,\" is very significant. There are many so-called devotees, but actually they are only karmés and jïänés, for they are not directly devotees of Lord Kåñëa. The karmés sometimes offer the results of their activities to Lord Väsudeva, and this offering is called karmärpaëam. These are considered to be fruitive activities, for the karmés consider Lord Viñëu to be one of the demigods like Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä. Because they consider Lord Viñëu to be on the same level with the demigods, they contend that surrendering to the demigods is as good as surrendering unto Väsudeva. This contention is denied herein because if it were true, Lord Çiva would have said that surrender unto him, Lord Väsudeva, Viñëu or Brahmä is the same. However, Lord Çiva does not say this because he himself surrenders unto Väsudeva, and whoever else surrenders unto Väsudeva is very, very dear to him. This is expressed herein openly. The conclusion is that a devotee of Lord Çiva is not dear to Lord Çiva, but a devotee of Lord Kåñëa is very dear to Lord Çiva."
