Sädhu-saìga, or association with a devotee, means always engaging in Kåñëa consciousness by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra and by acting for Kåñëa. Specifically, chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra purifies one, and this chanting is therefore recommended by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Ceto-darpaëa-märjanam: . He whose heart is purified can see that the whole cosmic manifestation is but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but he whose heart is contaminated sees things differently. Therefore by sat-saìga, or association with devotees, one becomes perfectly pure in heart."

            "content": "One who is pure in heart is never attracted by the external energy, which urges the individual soul to try to dominate material nature. The pure heart of a devotee is never disturbed when he executes devotional service in the form of hearing, chanting, remembering, etc. In all, there are nine processes one can follow in the execution of devotional service. In any case, a pure-hearted devotee is never disturbed. The bhakti-yoga process must be carried out by avoiding the ten offenses one can commit while chanting the mahä-mantra and the sixty-four offenses one can commit while worshiping the Deity. When a devotee strictly follows the rules and regulations, Bhaktidevé becomes very much satisfied with him, and at that time he is never disturbed by anything external. A devotee is also called a muni. The word muni means \"thoughtful.\" A devotee is as thoughtful as a nondevotee is speculative. The nondevotee's speculation is impure, but a devotee's thoughts are pure. Lord Kapila and Çukadeva Gosvämé are also called muni, and Vyäsadeva is addressed as Mahämuni. A devotee is addressed as muni, or thoughtful, when he purely understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conclusion is that when one's heart is purified by the association of devotees and by the avoidance of the offenses committed when chanting and worshiping the Lord, the transcendental name, form and activities of the Lord are revealed by the Lord."
