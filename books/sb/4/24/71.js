    "translation": "My dear princes, in the form of a prayer I have delineated the yoga system of chanting the holy name. All of you should take this important stotra within your minds and promise to keep it in order to become great sages. By acting silently like a great sage and by giving attention and reverence, you should practice this method.",

There are so many rules and regulations for the haöha-yoga system that it is practically impossible to perform it in this age. The alternative system of bhakti-yoga is very easy not only in this age but in others as well, for this yoga system was advocated long ago by Lord Çiva when he advised the princes, the sons of Mahäräja Präcénabarhiñat. The bhakti-yoga system is not newly introduced, for even five thousand years ago Lord Kåñëa recommended this bhakti-yoga as the topmost yoga. As Kåñëa tells Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä :"

We should either talk of Kåñëa or chant Hare Kåñëa undeviatingly. This is called muni-vrata. The intelligence must be very sharp (samähita-dhiyaù) and should always be acting in Kåñëa consciousness. The words etad abhyasatädåtäù indicate that if one takes these instructions from a spiritual master with great reverence (ädåta) and practices them accordingly, he will find this bhakti-yoga process to be very, very easy."
