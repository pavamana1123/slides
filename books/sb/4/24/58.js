            "content": "The Ganges water is celebrated as being able to eradicate all kinds of sinful reactions. In other words, when a person takes his bath in the Ganges, he becomes freed from all life's contaminations. The Ganges water is celebrated in this way because it emanates from the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, those who are directly in touch with the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who are absorbed in the chanting of His glories are freed from all material contamination. Such unalloyed devotees are able to show mercy to the common conditioned soul. Çréla Våndävana däsa Öhäkura has sung that the devotees of Lord Caitanya are so powerful that each one of them can deliver a universe. In other words, it is the business of devotees to preach the glories of the Lord and deliver all conditioned souls to the platform of çuddha-sattva, pure goodness. Here the word su-sattva means çuddha-sattva, the transcendental stage beyond material goodness. By his exemplary prayers, Lord Çiva teaches us that our best course it to take shelter of Lord Viñëu and His Vaiñëava devotees."
