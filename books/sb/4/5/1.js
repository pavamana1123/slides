But such a compromise was not attained, and Saté was deliberately insulted by her father by not being received properly when she visited his house without being invited. Saté herself could have killed her father, Dakña, because she is the personified material energy and has immense power to kill and create within this material universe. In the Brahma-saàhitä her strength is described: she is capable of creating and dissolving many universes. But although she is so powerful, she acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, as His shadow. It would not have been difficult for Saté to punish her father, but she thought that since she was his daughter, it was not proper for her to kill him. Thus she decided to give up her own body, which she had obtained from his, and Dakña did not even check her."

            "content": "When Saté passed away, giving up her body, the news was conveyed by Närada to Lord Çiva. Närada always carries the news of such events because he knows their import. When Lord Çiva heard that his chaste wife, Saté, was dead, he naturally became exceedingly angry. He also understood that Bhågu Muni had created the Åbhudeva demigods by uttering the mantras of the Yajur Veda and that these demigods had driven away all of his soldiers who were present in the arena of sacrifice. Therefore, he wanted to reply to this insult, and thus he decided to kill Dakña because he was the cause of the death of Saté."
