            "content": "In this verse Dakña has been described as mahätmä. The word mahätmä has been commented upon by different commentators in various manners. Véraräghava Äcärya has indicated that this word mahätmä means \"steady in heart.\" That is to say that Dakña was so stronghearted that even when his beloved daughter was prepared to lay down her life, he was steady and unshaken. But in spite of his being so stronghearted, he was perturbed when he saw the various disturbances created by the gigantic black demon. Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura remarks in this connection that even if one is called mahätmä, a great soul, unless he exhibits the symptoms of a mahätmä, he should be considered a durätmä, or a degraded soul. In Bhagavad-gétä  the word mahätmä describes the pure devotee of the Lord: mahätmänas tu mäà pärtha daivéà prakåtim äçritäù. A mahätmä is always under the guidance of the internal energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus how could such a misbehaved person as Dakña be a mahätmä? A mahätmä is supposed to have all the good qualities of the demigods, and thus Dakña, lacking those qualities, could not be called a mahätmä; he should instead be called durätmä, a degraded soul. The word mahätmä to describe the qualifications of Dakña is used sarcastically."
