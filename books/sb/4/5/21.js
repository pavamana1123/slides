    "translation": "Just as Baladeva knocked out the teeth of Dantavakra, the King of Kaliìga, during the gambling match at the marriage ceremony of Aniruddha, Vérabhadra knocked out the teeth of both Dakña, who had shown them while cursing Lord Çiva, and Püñä, who by smiling sympathetically had also shown his teeth.",

            "content": "Here a reference is made to the marriage of Aniruddha, a grandson of Lord Kåñëa's. He kidnapped the daughter of Dantavakra, and thereafter he was arrested. Just as he was to be punished for the kidnapping, the soldiers from Dvärakä arrived, headed by Balaräma, and a fight ensued amongst the kñatriyas. This sort of fight was very common, especially during marriage ceremonies, when everyone was in a challenging spirit. In that challenging spirit, a fight was sure to occur, and in such fights there was commonly killing and misfortune. After finishing such fighting, the parties would come to a compromise, and everything would be settled. This Dakña yajïa was similar to such events. Now all of them—Dakña and the demigods Bhaga and Püñä and Bhågu Muni—were punished by the soldiers of Lord Çiva, but later everything would come to a peaceful end. So this spirit of fighting between one another was not exactly inimical. Because everyone was so powerful and wanted to show his strength by Vedic mantra or mystic power, all these fighting skills were very elaborately exhibited by the different parties at the Dakña yajïa."
