    "translation": "When that gigantic demon asked with folded hands, \"What shall I do, my lord?\" Lord Çiva, who is known as Bhütanätha, directly ordered, \"Because you are born from my body, you are the chief of all my associates. Therefore, kill Dakña and his soldiers at the sacrifice.\"",

By brahma-tejas, brahminical strength, Bhågu Muni had created the Åbhu demigods, who had driven away the soldiers of Lord Çiva stationed in the arena. When Lord Çiva heard that his soldiers had been driven away, he created the tall black demon Vérabhadra to retaliate. There is sometimes a competition between the mode of goodness and the mode of ignorance. That is the way of material existence. Even when one is situated in the mode of goodness, there is every possibility that his position will be mixed with or attacked by the mode of passion or ignorance. That is the law of material nature. Although pure goodness, or çuddha-sattva, is the basic principle in the spiritual world, pure manifestation of goodness is not possible in this material world. Thus, the struggle for existence between different material qualities is always present. This quarrel between Lord Çiva and Bhågu Muni, centering around Prajäpati Dakña, is the practical example of such competition between the different qualitative modes of material nature."
