This description indicates that the strength of Lord Çiva is so great that Dakña's power could not be set in comparison to it. At the time of dissolution, Lord Çiva, with his trident in hand, dances over the rulers of the different planets, and his hair is scattered, just as the clouds are scattered over all directions in order to plunge the different planets into incessant torrents of rain. In the last phase of dissolution, all the planets become inundated with water, and that inundation is caused by the dancing of Lord Çiva. This dance is called the pralaya dance, or dance of dissolution. Prasüti could understand that the dangers ahead resulted not only from Dakña's having neglected her daughter, but also because of his neglecting the prestige and honor of Lord Çiva."
