He was so cruel that he would not save her youngest daughter, Saté, from the act of committing suicide in the presence of her sisters. Saté's mother could understand how much Saté had been pained by the insult of her father. Saté had been present along with the other daughters, and Dakña had purposely received all of them but her because she happened to be the wife of Lord Çiva. This consideration convinced the wife of Dakña of the danger which was now ahead, and thus she knew that Dakña must be prepared to die for his heinous act."
