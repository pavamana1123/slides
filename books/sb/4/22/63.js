From this verse it appears that Påthu Mahäräja's reputation was so great that ladies all over the universe would hear of it with great pleasure. At the same time, his glories were heard all over the universe by the devotees, and they were as pleasing as Lord Rämacandra's glories. Lord Rämacandra's kingdom is still existing, and recently there was a political party in India named the Rämaräjya party, which wanted to establish a kingdom resembling the kingdom of Räma. Unfortunately, modern politicians want the kingdom of Räma without Räma Himself. Although they have banished the idea of God consciousness, they still expect to establish the kingdom of Räma. Such a proposal is rejected by devotees. Påthu Mahäräja's reputation was heard by saintly persons because he exactly represented Lord Rämacandra, the ideal king."
