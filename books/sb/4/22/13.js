            "content": "Mahäräja Påthu did not ask the Kumäras about their good fortune, for the Kumäras are always auspicious by dint of their life in celibacy. Since they are always engaged on the path of liberation, there was no question of ill fortune. In other words, brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas who are strictly following the path of spiritual advancement are always fortunate. The question was asked by Påthu Mahäräja for his own sake, since he was in the position of a gåhastha and in charge of the royal authority. Kings are not only gåhasthas, who are generally absorbed in sense gratification, but are sometimes employed to kill animals in hunting because they have to practice the killing art, otherwise it is very difficult for them to fight their enemies. Such things are not auspicious. Four kinds of sinful activities—associating with woman for illicit sex, eating meat, intoxication and gambling—are allowed for the kñatriyas. For political reasons, sometimes they have to take to these sinful activities. Kñatriyas do not refrain from gambling. One vivid example is the Päëòavas. When the Päëòavas were challenged by the opposite party, Duryodhana, to gamble and risk their kingdom, they could not refrain, and by that gambling they lost their kingdom, and their wife was insulted. Similarly, the kñatriyas cannot refrain from fighting if challenged by the opposite party. Therefore Påthu Mahäräja, taking consideration of all these facts, inquired whether there is any auspicious path. Gåhastha life is inauspicious because gåhastha means consciousness for sense gratification, and as soon as there is sense gratification, one's position is always full of dangers. This material world is said to be padaà padaà yad vipadäà na teñäm, dangerous in every step . Everyone in this material world is struggling hard for sense gratification. Clearing all these points, Mahäräja Påthu inquired from the four Kumäras about the fallen conditioned souls who are rotting in this material world due to their past bad or inauspicious activities. Is there any possibility for their auspicious spiritual life? In this verse, the word indriyärthärtha-vedinäm is very significant. It indicates persons whose only aim is to satisfy the senses. They are also described as patitänäm, or fallen. Only one who stops all activities for sense gratification is considered to be elevated. Another significant word is sva-karmabhiù. One becomes fallen by dint of his own past bad activities. Everyone is responsible for his fallen condition because of his own activities. When activities are changed to devotional service, one's auspicious life begins."
