            "content": "As a householder, Påthu Mahäräja had five sons by his wife, Arci, and all these sons were begotten as he desired them. They were not born whimsically or by accident. How one can beget children according to one's own desire is practically unknown in the present age (Kali-yuga). In this regard the secret of success depends on the parents' acceptance of the various purificatory methods known as saàskäras. The first saàskära, the garbhädhäna-saàskära, or child-begetting saàskära, is compulsory, especially for the higher castes, the brähmaëas and the kñatriyas. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, sex life which is not against religious principles is Kåñëa Himself, and according to religious principles, when one wants to beget a child he must perform the garbhädhäna-saàskära before having sex. The mental state of the father and mother before sex will certainly affect the mentality of the child to be begotten. A child who is begotten out of lust may not turn out as the parents desire. As stated in the çästras, yathä yonir yathä béjam. Yathä yoniù indicates the mother, and yathä béjam indicates the father. If the mental state of the parents is prepared before they have sex, the child which they will beget will certainly reflect their mental condition. It is therefore understood by the words ätma-sammatän that both Påthu Mahäräja and Arci underwent the garbhädhäna purificatory process before begetting children, and thus they begot all their sons according to their desires and purified mental states. Påthu Mahäräja did not beget his children out of lust, nor was he attracted to his wife for sense gratificatory purposes. He begot the children as a gåhastha for the future administration of his government all over the world."
