Therefore Påthu Mahäräja remembered the causeless mercy of the Lord and thus welcomed the arrival of the Kumäras, who were fulfilling the Lord's prediction. In other words, when the Lord makes a prediction, He fulfills that prediction through some of His devotees. Similarly, Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu predicted that both His glorious names and the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra would be broadcast in all the towns and villages of the world. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura and Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Prabhupäda desired to fulfill this great prediction, and we are following in their footsteps."

The Lord Himself promises, and His confidential devotees execute the promise. The Lord makes so many promises for the benefit of suffering humanity. Although the Lord is very compassionate upon suffering humanity, human beings are generally not very anxious to serve Him. The relationship is something like that between the father and the son; the father is always anxious for the welfare of the son, even though the son forgets or neglects the father. The word anukampinä is significant; the Lord is so compassionate upon the living entities that He comes Himself into this world in order to benefit fallen souls."

            "content": "Thus it is out of compassion that the Lord appears in His different forms. Lord Çré Kåñëa appeared on this planet out of compassion for fallen souls; Lord Buddha appeared out of compassion for the poor animals who were being killed by the demons; Lord Nåsiàhadeva appeared out of compassion for Prahläda Mahäräja. The conclusion is that the Lord is so compassionate upon the fallen souls within this material world that He comes Himself or sends His devotees and His servants to fulfill His desire to have all the fallen souls come back home, back to Godhead. Thus Lord Çré Kåñëa instructed Bhagavad-gétä to Arjuna for the benefit of the entire human society. Intelligent men should therefore seriously consider this Kåñëa consciousness movement and fully utilize the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä as preached without adulteration by His pure devotees."
