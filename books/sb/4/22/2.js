            "content": "The four Kumäras are described herein as siddheçvarän, which means \"masters of all mystic power.\" One who has attained perfection in yoga practice immediately becomes master of the eight mystic perfections—to become smaller than the smallest, to become lighter than the lightest, to become bigger than the biggest, to achieve anything one desires, to control everything, etc. These four Kumäras, as siddheçvaras, had achieved all the yogic perfectional achievements, and as such they could travel in outer space without machines. While they were coming to Mahäräja Påthu from other planets, they did not come by airplane, but personally. In other words, these four Kumäras were also spacemen who could travel in space without machines. The residents of the planet known as Siddhaloka can travel in outer space from one planet to another without vehicles. However, the special power of the Kumäras mentioned herewith is that whatever place they went to would immediately become sinless. During the reign of Mahäräja Påthu, everything on the surface of this globe was sinless, and therefore the Kumäras decided to see the King. Ordinarily they do not go to any planet which is sinful."
