The Lord is already in the heart of everyone, but the Vaiñëavas and the brähmaëas actually perceive and see Him always in ecstasy. Therefore brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas are carriers of Viñëu. Wherever they go, Lord Viñëu, Lord Çiva or the devotees of Lord Viñëu are all carried. The four Kumäras are brähmaëas, and they visited the place of Mahäräja Påthu. Naturally Lord Viñëu and His devotees were also present. Under the circumstances, the conclusion is that when the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas are pleased with a person, Lord Viñëu is also pleased. This is confirmed by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura in his eight stanzas on the spiritual master: yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädaù. By pleasing the spiritual master, who is both brähmaëa and Vaiñëava, one pleases the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased, then one has nothing more to achieve either in this world or after death."
