    "translation": "Påthu Mahäräja continued: How can such persons, who have rendered unlimited service by explaining the path of self-realization in relation to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and whose explanations are given for our enlightenment with complete conviction and Vedic evidence, be repaid except by folded palms containing water for their satisfaction? Such great personalities can be satisfied only by their own activities, which are distributed amongst human society out of their unlimited mercy.",

All living entities are within the clutches of the illusory energy. Forgetting their real identity, they hover in material existence, transmigrating from one body to another in search of a peaceful life. Since these living entities have very little knowledge of self-realization, they are not getting any relief, although they are very anxious to attain peace of mind and some substantial happiness. Saintly persons like the Kumäras, Närada, Prahläda, Janaka, Çukadeva Gosvämé and Kapiladeva, as well as the followers of such authorities as the Vaiñëava äcäryas and their servants, can render a valuable service to humanity by disseminating knowledge of the relationship between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity. Such knowledge is the perfect benediction for humanity."

Therefore Påthu Mahäräja requested the Kumäras to be satisfied by their own benevolent activities in delivering souls from the clutches of mäyä. The King saw that there was no other way to satisfy them for their exalted activities. The word vinoda-pätram can be divided into two words, vinä and uda-pätram, or can be understood as one word, vinoda-pätram, which means \"joker.\" A joker's activities simply arouse laughter, and a person who tries to repay the spiritual master or teacher of the transcendental message of Kåñëa becomes a laughingstock just like a joker because it is not possible to repay such a debt. The best friend and benefactor of all people is one who awakens humanity to its original Kåñëa consciousness."
