The term karma-yoga is often used in Bhagavad-géta—, and herein Mahäräja Påthu is giving a practical example of what karma-yoga actually is. The first requirement for the proper execution of karma-yoga is given herein. phalaà brahmaëi sannyasya (or vinyasya): one must give the fruits of his activities to the Supreme Brahman, Parabrahman, Kåñëa. By doing so, one actually situates himself in the renounced order of life, sannyäsa. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , giving up the fruits of one's activities to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called sannyäsa."

In this material world a person is always thinking of the proprietorship of everything he accumulates or works for. When the fruits of one's activities are rendered to the service of the Lord, one is actually practicing karma-yoga. Anyone can practice karma-yoga, but it is especially easy for the householder, who can install the Deity of the Lord in the home and worship Him according to the methods of bhakti-yoga. This method includes nine items: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping the Deity, praying, carrying out orders, serving Kåñëa as friend and sacrificing everything for Him."

Events in the material world are not taking place blindly. If one always remains a servant of Kåñëa and engages everything in His service, one is accepted as jévan-mukta, a liberated soul, even during his lifetime within the material world. Generally liberation takes place after one gives up this body, but one who lives according to the example of Påthu Mahäräja is liberated even in this lifetime. In Kåñëa consciousness the results of one's activities depend on the will of the Supreme Person. Indeed, in all cases the result is not dependent on one's own personal dexterity but is completely dependent on the will of the Supreme. This is the real significance of phalaà brahmaëi sannyasya. A soul dedicated to the service of the Lord should never think of himself as the personal proprietor or the superintendent. A dedicated devotee should prosecute his work according to the rules and regulations described in devotional service. The results of his activities are completely dependent on the supreme will of the Lord."
