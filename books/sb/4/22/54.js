Similarly, there is a predominating deity of the moon and of the various planets. Actually the predominating deities in all the other planets are descendants from the predominating deities of the sun and moon. On this planet earth there are two kñatriya dynasties, and one comes from the predominating deity of the sun and the other from the predominating deity of the moon. These dynasties are known as Sürya-vaàça and Candra-vaàça respectively. When monarchy existed on this planet, the chief member was one of the members of the Sürya dynasty, or Sürya-vaàça, and the subordinate kings belonged to the Candra-vaàça. However, Mahäräja Påthu was so powerful that he could exhibit all the qualities of the predominating deities in other planets."

The Vedic literature, however, repeatedly informs us that the moon is full of highly elevated inhabitants who are counted amongst the demigods. We are therefore always in doubt about what kind of moon adventure the modern scientists of this planet earth have undertaken."
