The ultimate goal of life is described in Bhagavad-gétä  as paraà dåñövä nivartate. One can cease material activities when he actually has the taste for devotional service. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu also recommended love of Godhead as the ultimate goal of life (premä pum-artho mahän). Without increasing love of Godhead, one cannot achieve the perfectional stage of the transcendental position."
