            "content": "In the beginning of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is said: muhyanti yat sürayaù. Great demigods like Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva, Indra and Candra are sometimes bewildered trying to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It so happened that when Kåñëa was present on this planet, Lord Brahmä and King Indra also mistook Him. And what to speak of great yogés or jïänés who conclude that the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is impersonal? In the same way, great personalities and Vaiñëavas like the four Kumäras are also invisible to ordinary persons, although they are traveling all over the universe in different planetary systems. When Sanätana Gosvämé went to see Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, he could not be recognized by Candraçekhara Äcärya. The conclusion is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone's heart, and His pure devotees, the Vaiñëavas, are also traveling all over the world, but those who are under the modes of material nature cannot understand the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the source of this cosmic manifestation, or the Vaiñëavas. It is said, therefore, that one cannot see the Supreme Personality of Godhead or a Vaiñëava with these material eyes. One has to purify his senses and engage in the service of the Lord. Then gradually one can realize who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who is a Vaiñëava."
