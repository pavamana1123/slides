Like the great sage Närada, the Kumäras do not require any machine to travel in space. There are also residents of Siddhaloka who can travel in space without machines. Since they can go from one planet to another, they are called siddhas; that is to say they have acquired all mystic and yogic powers. Such great saintly persons who have attained complete perfection in mystic yoga are not visible in this age on earth because humanity is not worthy of their presence. The Kumäras, however, praised the characteristics of Mahäräja Påthu and his great devotional attitude and humility. The Kumäras were greatly satisfied by King Påthu's method of worship. It was by the grace of Mahäräja Påthu that the common citizens in his domain could see the Kumäras flying in outer space."
