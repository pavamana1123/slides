To see personally the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His pure devotee is not an ordinary incident. When such things happen, they should be understood to be caused by previous pious activity, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä : yeñäà tv anta-gataà päpaà janänäà puëya-karmaëäm. One who is completely freed from all the resultant actions of sinful activities and who is absorbed only in pious activities can engage in devotional service. Although Mahäräja Påthu's life was full of pious activities, he was wondering how his audience with the Kumäras happened. He could not imagine what kind of pious activities he had performed. This is a sign of humility on the part of King Påthu, whose life was so full of pious activities that even Lord Viñëu came to see him and predicted that the Kumäras would also come."
