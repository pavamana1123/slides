It is very well known that whatever Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu taught in His life as äcärya, He Himself practiced. When He was preaching as a devotee, although He was detected by several great personalities to be the incarnation of Kåñëa, He never agreed to be addressed as an incarnation. Even though one may be an incarnation of Kåñëa, or especially empowered by Him, he should not advertise that he is an incarnation. People will automatically accept the real truth in due course of time. Påthu Mahäräja was the ideal Vaiñëava king; therefore he taught others by his personal behavior how to receive and respect saintly persons like the Kumäras. When a saintly person comes to one's home, it is the Vedic custom first to wash his feet with water and then sprinkle this water over the heads of oneself and one's family. Påthu Mahäräja did this, for he was an exemplary teacher of the people in general."
