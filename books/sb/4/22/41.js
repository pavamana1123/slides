            "content": "In this verse the word ätma-medhasä is commented upon by Çrépäda Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, who says that ätmani means \"unto Lord Kåñëa, paramätmani.\" Lord Kåñëa is Paramätmä. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù (BS 5.1). Therefore one whose mind is acting fully in Kåñëa consciousness is called ätma-medhäù. This may be contrasted to the word gåha-medhé, which refers to one whose brain is always engrossed with thoughts of material activities. The ätma-medhäù is always thinking of Kåñëa's activities in Kåñëa consciousness. Since Sanat-kumära, who was a son of Lord Brahmä, was fully Kåñëa conscious, he could point out the path of spiritual advancement. The word ätma-gatiù refers to that path of activities by which one can make progress in understanding Kåñëa."
