            "content": "When saintly persons go from door to door to see those who are too much materially engaged, it is to be understood that they do not go to ask anything for their personal benefit. It is a fact that saintly persons go to materialists just to give real information of the auspicious. Mahäräja Påthu was assured of this fact; therefore instead of wasting time by asking the Kumäras about their welfare, he preferred to inquire from them whether he could soon be relieved from the dangerous position of materialistic existence. This was not, however, a question personally for Påthu Mahäräja. It was raised to teach the common man that whenever one meets a great saintly person, one should immediately surrender unto him and inquire about relief from the material pains of existence. Therefore Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, saàsära-viñänale, diväniçi hiyä jvale, juòäite nä kainu upäya: \"we are always suffering from material pangs, and our hearts are burning, but we cannot find any way out of it.\" The materialistic person can also be called a tapasvé, which means someone who is always suffering from material pains. One can get rid of all these material pains only when he takes shelter of the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra. This is also explained by Narottama däsa Öhäkura: golokera prema-dhana, hari-näma-saìkértana, rati nä janmila kene täya. Narottama däsa Öhäkura regretted that he did not pursue his attraction for the transcendental vibration of the Hare Kåñëa mantra. The conclusion is that all persons in this material world are suffering from material pains, and if one wants to get rid of them, he must associate with saintly persons, pure devotees of the Lord, and chant the mahä-mantra, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. That is the only auspicious way for materialistic persons."
