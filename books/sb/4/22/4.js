    "translation": "When the great sages accepted their reception, according to the instructions of the çästras, and finally took their seats offered by the King, the King, influenced by the glories of the sages, immediately bowed down. Thus he worshiped the four Kumäras.",

            "content": "The four Kumäras are paramparä spiritual masters of the Vaiñëava sampradäya. Out of the four sampradäyas, namely Brahma-sampradäya, Çré-sampradäya, Kumära-sampradäya and Rudra-sampradäya, the disciplic succession of spiritual master to disciple known as the Kumära-sampradäya is coming down from the four Kumäras. So Påthu Mahäräja was very respectful to the sampradäya-äcäryas. As it is said by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, säkñäd-dharitvena samasta-çästraiù: a spiritual master, or the paramparä-äcärya, should be respected exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word vidhivat is significant in this verse. This means that Påthu Mahäräja also strictly followed the injunctions of the çästra in receiving a spiritual master, or äcärya, of the transcendental disciplic succession. Whenever an äcärya is seen, one should immediately bow down before him. Påthu Mahäräja did this properly; therefore the words used here are praçrayänata-kandharaù. Out of humility, he bowed down before the Kumäras."
