    "translation": "Mahäräja Påthu offered his welcome to the four Kumäras, addressing them as the best of the brähmaëas. He welcomed them, saying: From the beginning of your birth you strictly observed the vows of celibacy, and although you are experienced in the path of liberation, you are keeping yourselves just like small children.",

            "content": "The specific importance of the Kumäras is that they were brahmacärés, living the life of celibacy from birth. They kept themselves as small children about four or five years old because by growing into youth one's senses sometimes become disturbed and celibacy becomes difficult. The Kumäras therefore purposefully remained children because in a child's life the senses are never disturbed by sex. This is the significance of the life of the Kumäras, and as such Mahäräja Påthu addressed them as the best of the brähmaëas. Not only were the Kumäras born of the best brähmaëa (Lord Brahmä), but they are addressed herein as dvija-çreñöhäù (\"the best of the brähmaëas\") on account of their being Vaiñëavas also. As we have already explained, they have their sampradäya (disciplic succession), and even to date the sampradäya is being maintained and is known as the Nimbärka-sampradäya. Out of the four sampradäyas of the Vaiñëava äcäryas, the Nimbärka-sampradäya is one. Mahäräja Påthu specifically appreciated the position of the Kumäras because they maintained the brahmacarya vow from the very beginning of their birth. Mahäräja Påthu, however, expressed his great appreciation of Vaiñëavism by addressing the Kumäras as vaiñëava-çreñöhäù. In other words, everyone should offer respect to a Vaiñëava without considering his source of birth. Vaiñëave jäti-buddhiù. No one should consider a Vaiñëava in terms of birth. The Vaiñëava is always the best of the brähmaëas, and as such one should offer all respects to a Vaiñëava, not only as a brähmaëa but as the best of the brähmaëas."
