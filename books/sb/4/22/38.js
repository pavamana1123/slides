    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests Himself as one with the cause and effect within this body, but one who has transcended the illusory energy by deliberate consideration, which clears the misconception of a snake for a rope, can understand that the Paramätmä is eternally transcendental to the material creation and situated in pure internal energy. Thus the Lord is transcendental to all material contamination. Unto Him only must one surrender.",

            "content": "This verse is specifically stated to defy the Mäyäväda conclusion of oneness without differentiation between the individual soul and the Supersoul. The Mäyäväda conclusion is that the living entity and the Supersoul are one; there is no difference. The Mäyävädés proclaim that there is no separate existence outside the impersonal Brahman and that the feeling of separation is mäyä, or an illusion, by which one considers a rope to be a snake. The rope-and-the-snake argument is generally offered by the Mäyävädé philosophers. Therefore these words, which represent vivarta-väda, are specifically mentioned herein. Actually Paramätmä, the Supersoul, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is eternally liberated. In other words, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is living within this body along with the individual soul, and this is confirmed in the Vedas. They are likened to two friends sitting on the same tree. Yet Paramätmä is above the illusory energy. The illusory energy is called bahiraìgä çakti, or external energy, and the living entity is called taöasthä çakti, or marginal potency. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, the material energy, represented as earth, water, air, fire, sky, etc., and the spiritual energy, the living entity, are both energies of the Supreme Lord. Even though the energies and the energetic are identical, the living entity, individual soul, being prone to be influenced by the external energy, considers the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be one with himself."

            "content": "The word prapadye is also significant in this verse, for it refers to the conclusion of the Bhagavad-gétä . This prapadye or çaraëaà vraja refers to the individual's surrender to the Supersoul. The individual soul, when surrendered, can understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although situated within the heart of the individual soul, is superior to the individual soul. The Lord is always transcendental to the material manifestation, even though it appears that the Lord and the material manifestation are one and the same. According to the Vaiñëava philosophy, He is one and different simultaneously. The material energy is a manifestation of His external potency, and since the potency is identical with the potent, it appears that the Lord and individual soul are one; but actually the individual soul is under the influence of material energy, and the Lord is always transcendental to it. Unless the Lord is superior to the individual soul, there is no question of prapadye, or surrender unto Him. This word prapadye refers to the process of devotional service. Simply by nondevotional speculation on the rope and the snake, one cannot approach the Absolute Truth. Therefore devotional service is stressed as more important than deliberation or mental speculation to understand the Absolute Truth."
