            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped with the words namo brahmaëya-deväya, which indicate that the Supreme Lord accepts the brähmaëas as worshipable gods. The Supreme Lord is worshiped by everyone, yet to teach others He worships the brähmaëas. Everyone should follow the instructions of the brähmaëas, for their only business is to spread çabda-brahma, or Vedic knowledge, all over the world. Whenever there is a scarcity of brähmaëas to spread Vedic knowledge, chaos throughout human society results. Since brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas are direct servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they do not depend on others. In actuality, everything in the world belongs to the brähmaëas, and out of their humility the brähmaëas accept charity from the kñatriyas, or kings, and the vaiçyas, or merchants. Everything belongs to the brähmaëas, but the kñatriya government and the mercantile people keep everything in custody, like bankers, and whenever the brähmaëas need money, the kñatriyas and vaiçyas should supply it. It is like a savings account with money which the depositor can draw out at his will. The brähmaëas, being engaged in the service of the Lord, have very little time to handle the finances of the world, and therefore the riches are kept by the kñatriyas, or the kings, who are to produce money upon the brähmaëas' demand. Actually the brähmaëas or Vaiñëavas do not live at others' cost; they live by spending their own money, although it appears that they are collecting this money from others. Kñatriyas and vaiçyas have no right to give charity, for whatever they possess belongs to the brähmaëas. Therefore charity should be given by the kñatriyas and vaiçyas under the instructions of the brähmaëas. Unfortunately at the present moment there is a scarcity of brähmaëas, and since the so-called kñatriyas and vaiçyas do not carry out the orders of the brähmaëas, the world is in a chaotic condition."

            "content": "The second line of this verse indicates that the kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras eat only by virtue of the brähmaëa's mercy; in other words, they should not eat anything which is forbidden by the brähmaëas. The brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas know what to eat, and by their personal example they do not eat anything which is not offered first to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They eat only prasäda, or remnants of the food offered to the Lord. The kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras should eat only kåñëa-prasäda, which is afforded them by the mercy of the brähmaëas. They cannot open slaughterhouses and eat meat, fish or eggs or drink liquor, or earn money for this purpose without authorization. In the present age, because society is not guided by brahminical instruction, the whole population is only absorbed in sinful activities. Consequently, everyone is deservedly being punished by the laws of nature. This is the situation in this age of Kali."
