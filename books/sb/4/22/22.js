In the Eighteenth Chapter : sa me yuktatamo mataù. This yuktatama indicates the topmost of all yogés—the devotees, who can also be called yogeçvara. In this verse, yogeçvara-upäsanä means to render service to a pure devotee. Thus Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, chäòiyä vaiñëava-sevä nistära päyeche kebä: without serving a pure devotee, one cannot advance in spiritual life. Prahläda Mahäräja also has said:"

By serving him only, one can transcend the qualitative material condition. In this verse it is recommended (yogeçvara-upäsanayä) that one serve the lotus feet of the topmost yogé, or the devotee. To serve the topmost devotee means to hear from him about the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To hear the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from the mouth of a pure devotee is to acquire a pious life. In Bhagavad-gétä  it is also said that without being pious one cannot engage in devotional service."

For work in devotional service the first item is ädau gurv-äçrayam: one should accept a bona fide spiritual master, and from the bona fide spiritual master inquire about one's transcendental occupational duties (sad-dharma-påcchä) and follow in the footsteps of great saintly persons, devotees (sädhu-märga-anugamanam). These are the instructions given in Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu by Rüpa Gosvämé."

In this way one has to increase his conviction about devotional service. Then it will be very easy to increase attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
