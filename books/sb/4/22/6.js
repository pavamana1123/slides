            "content": "The Kumäras are described herein as the elder brothers of Lord Çiva. When the Kumäras were born out of the body of Lord Brahmä, they were requested to get married and increase the population. In the beginning of the creation there was a great need of population; therefore Lord Brahmä was creating one son after another and ordering them to increase. However, when the Kumäras were requested to do so, they declined. They wanted to remain brahmacäré throughout life and be engaged fully in the devotional service of the Lord. The Kumäras are called naiñöhika-brahmacäré, meaning they are never to marry. Because of their refusal to marry, Lord Brahmä became so angry that his eyes became reddish. From between his eyes, Lord Çiva, or Rudra, appeared. The mode of anger is consequently known as rudra. Lord Çiva also has a sampradäya party, known as the Rudra-sampradäya, and they are also known as Vaiñëavas."
