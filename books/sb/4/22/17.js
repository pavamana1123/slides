A speech should be composed of selected words, very sweet to hear and appropriate to the situation. Such speech is called meaningful. All these good qualifications are present in Påthu Mahäräja's speech because he is a perfect devotee. It is said, yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä sarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù: \"For one who has unflinching devotional faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is engaged in His service, all good qualities become manifest in his person.\"  Thus the Kumäras were very much pleased, and Sanat-kumära began to speak as follows."
