    "translation": "In his personal behavior, Påthu Mahäräja exhibited all good qualities, and in spiritual knowledge he was exactly like Båhaspati. In self-control he was like the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. As far as his devotional service was concerned, he was a great follower of devotees who were attached to cow protection and the rendering of all service to the spiritual master and the brähmaëas. He was perfect in his shyness and in his gentle behavior, and when he engaged in some philanthropic activity, he worked as if he were working for his own personal self.",

            "content": "When Lord Caitanya talked to Särvabhauma Bhaööäcärya, the Lord honored him as the incarnation of Båhaspati. Båhaspati is the chief priest of the heavenly kingdom, and he is a follower of the philosophy known as brahma-vada, or Mäyäväda. Båhaspati is also a great logician. It appears from this statement that Mahäräja Påthu, although a great devotee constantly engaged in the loving service of the Lord, could defeat all kinds of impersonalists and Mäyävädés by his profound knowledge of Vedic scriptures. We should learn from Mahäräja Påthu that a Vaiñëava, or devotee, must not only be fixed in the service of the Lord, but, if required, must be prepared to argue with the impersonalist Mäyävädés with all logic and philosophy and defeat their contention that the Absolute Truth is impersonal."

            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ideal self-controller or brahmacäré. When Kåñëa was elected to be president of the Räjasüya yajïa performed by Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, Grandfather Bhéñmadeva praised Lord Kåñëa as the greatest brahmacäré. Because Grandfather Bhéñmadeva was a brahmacäré, he was quite fit to distinguish a brahmacäré from a vyabhicäré. Although Påthu Mahäräja was a householder and father of five children, he was still considered to be most controlled. One who begets Kåñëa conscious children for the benefit of humanity is actually a brahmacäré. One who simply begets children like cats and dogs is not a proper father. The word brahmacäré also refers to one who acts on the platform of Brahman, or devotional service. In the impersonal Brahman conception, there is no activity, yet when one performs activities in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is to be known as brahmacäré. Thus Påthu Mahäräja was an ideal brahmacäré and gåhastha simultaneously. Viñvaksenänuvartiñu refers to those devotees who are constantly engaged in the service of the Lord. Other devotees must follow in their footsteps. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura said, ei chaya gosäïi yära, mui tära däsa. He is prepared to become the disciple of anyone who follows in the footsteps of the six Gosvämés."

Påthu Mahäräja was also very humble, meek and gentle, and whenever he performed any philanthropic work or welfare activity for the general public, he would labor exactly as if he were tending to his own personal necessities. In other words, his philanthropic activities were not for the sake of show but were performed out of personal feeling and commitment. All philanthropic activities should be thus performed."
