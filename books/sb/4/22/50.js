Being perfect in the Lord's devotional service, he could execute his prescribed duties with complete perfection as befitted the time and circumstance and his financial strength and personal ability. In this regard, the word karmäëi in this verse is significant. Påthu Mahäräja's activities were not ordinary, for they were in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has advised that things which are favorable to devotional service should not be rejected, nor should activity favorable for devotional service be considered ordinary work or fruitive activity. For example, an ordinary worker conducts business in order to earn money for his sense gratification. A devotee may perform the same work in exactly the same way, but his aim is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. Consequently his activities are not ordinary."

            "content": "Påthu Mahäräja's activities were therefore not ordinary but were all spiritual and transcendental, for his aim was to satisfy the Lord. Just as Arjuna, who was a warrior, had to fight to satisfy Kåñëa, Påthu Mahäräja performed his royal duties as king for the satisfaction of Kåñëa. Indeed, whatever he did as emperor of the whole world was perfectly befitting a pure devotee. It is therefore said by a Vaiñëava poet, vaiñëavera kriyämudrä vijïe nä bujhäya: no one can understand the activities of a pure devotee. A pure devotee's activities may appear like ordinary activities, but behind them there is profound significance—the satisfaction of the Lord. In order to understand the activities of a Vaiñëava, one has to become very expert. Mahäräja Påthu did not allow himself to function outside the institution of four varëas and four äçramas, although as a Vaiñëava he was a paramahaàsa, transcendental to all material activities. He remained at his position as a kñatriya to rule the world and at the same time remained transcendental to such activities by satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Concealing himself as a pure devotee, he externally manifested himself as a very powerful and dutiful king. In other words, none of his activities were carried out for his own sense gratification; everything he did was meant for the satisfaction of the senses of the Lord. This is clearly explained in the next verse."
