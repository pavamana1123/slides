In Bhagavad-gétä  it is confirmed that Lord Brahmä created all living entities, including human beings and demigods, and advised them to perform yajïa according to their material desires (saha-yajïäù prajäù såñövä). These performances are called yajïas because their ultimate goal is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu. The purpose of performing yajïas is to get material benefit, but because the aim is to simultaneously satisfy the Supreme Lord, such yajïas have been recommended in the Vedas. Such performances are, of course, known as karma-käëòa, or material activities, and all material activities are certainly contaminated by the three modes of material nature. Generally the karma-käëòa ritualistic ceremonies are performed in the mode of passion, yet the conditioned souls, both human beings and demigods, are obliged to perform these yajïas because without them one cannot be happy at all."

This is very important because even a little endeavor to please Lord Viñëu is bhakti and is of great value. A tinge of bhakti purifies the material nature of the performances, which by devotional service gradually come to the transcendental position. Therefore although such yajïas are superficially material activities, the results are transcendental. Such yajïas as Sürya-yajïa, Indra-yajïa and Candra-yajïa are performed in the names of the demigods, but these demigods are bodily parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The demigods cannot accept sacrificial offerings for themselves, but they can accept them for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as a departmental tax collector of a government cannot collect taxes for his personal account but can realize them for the government. Any yajïa performed with this complete knowledge and understanding is described in Bhagavad-gétä as brahmärpaëam, or a sacrifice offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since no one but the Supreme Lord can enjoy the results of sacrifice, the Lord says that He is the actual enjoyer of all sacrifices (bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäà sarva-loka-maheçvaram :"

Viñëur ärädhyate panthäù (Viñëu Puräëa 3.8.9). Anything material or spiritual done for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord is understood to be an actual yajïa, and by performing such yajïas one gets liberation from material bondage. The direct method of getting liberation from material bondage is devotional service, comprising the nine following methods:"

For example, medical science knows some things superficially, but doctors do not know exactly how things happen in the body. Lord Kåñëa, however, knows everything in detail. Therefore His knowledge is vijïäna-ghana because it does not have any of the defects of material science. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is viçuddha-vijïäna-ghana, concentrated transcendental knowledge; therefore, even though He accepts karma-käëòéya materialistic yajïas, He always remains in a transcendental position. Therefore, the mention of aneka-guëa refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead's many transcendental qualities, for He is not affected by the material qualities. The different kinds of material paraphernalia or physical elements are also gradually transformed into spiritual understanding because ultimately there is no difference between material and spiritual qualities, for everything emanates from the Supreme Spirit. This is realized by a gradual process of realization and purification. One vivid example of this is Dhruva Mahäräja, who took to meditation in the forest to achieve material benefit but ultimately became spiritually advanced and did not want any benediction for material profit. He was simply satisfied with the association of the Supreme Lord. Äçaya means \"determination.\" Generally a conditioned soul has the determination for material profit, but when these desires for material profit are satisfied through performance of yajïa, one gradually achieves the spiritual platform. Then his life becomes perfect. Çrémad-Bhägavatam  therefore recommends:"
