Påthu Mahäräja has already explained that the chief duty of the government is to see that everyone executes his respective duty and is elevated to the platform of Kåñëa consciousness. The government should be so conducted that automatically one is elevated to Kåñëa consciousness. King Påthu therefore wanted his citizens to cooperate fully with him, for if they assented, they would enjoy the same profit as he after death. If Påthu Mahäräja, as a perfect king, were elevated to the heavenly planets, the citizens who cooperated by approving of his methods would also be elevated with him. Since the Kåñëa consciousness movement going on at the present moment is genuine, perfect and authorized and is following in the footsteps of Påthu Mahäräja, anyone who cooperates with this movement or accepts its principles will get the same result as the workers who are actively propagating Kåñëa consciousness."
