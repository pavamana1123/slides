            "content": "Narottama däsa Öhäkura states that one has to ascertain the right path for his activities by following in the footsteps of great saintly persons and books of knowledge under the guidance of a spiritual master (sädhu-çästra-guru-väkya). A saintly person is one who follows the Vedic injunctions, which are the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word guru refers to one who gives proper direction under the authority of the Vedic injunctions and according to the examples of the lives of great personalities. The best way to mold one's life is to follow in the footsteps of the authorized personalities like those mentioned herein by Påthu Mahäräja, beginning with Sväyambhuva Manu. The safest path in life is to follow such great personalities, especially those mentioned in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The mahäjanas, or great personalities, are Brahmä, Lord Çiva, Närada Muni, Manu, the Kumäras, Prahläda Mahäräja, Bali Mahäräja, Yamaräja, Bhéñma, Janaka, Çukadeva Gosvämé and Kapila Muni."
