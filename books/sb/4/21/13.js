            "content": "In this verse the most significant point is that although King Påthu's residential quarters were in India, between the rivers Ganges and Yamunä, the demigods also participated in the great sacrifice he performed. This indicates that formerly the demigods used to come to this planet. Similarly, great personalities like Arjuna, Yudhiñöhira and many others used to visit higher planetary systems. Thus there was interplanetary communication via suitable airplanes and space vehicles."
