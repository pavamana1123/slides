Although one's duration of life is limited in years, if by chance one becomes a devotee, he surpasses the duration prescribed for his life; indeed, sometimes yogés die according to their wish, not according to the laws of material nature. Another feature of a devotee is that he lives forever because of his infallible devotion to the Lord. It is said, kértir yasya sa jévati: \"One who leaves a good reputation behind him lives forever.\" Specifically, one who is reputed as a devotee of the Lord undoubtedly lives forever. When Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu was talking with Rämänanda Räya, Caitanya Mahäprabhu inquired, \"What is the greatest reputation?\" Rämänanda Räya replied that a person who is reputed as a great devotee has the greatest reputation, for a devotee not only lives forever in the Vaikuëöha planets, but by his reputation he also lives forever within this material world."
