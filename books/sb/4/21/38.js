In the lower stages of ignorance and passion, it is difficult to appreciate or understand the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Lord is described herein as the worshipable Deity for persons in brahminical and Vaiñëava culture."

Without knowing and respecting these, one cannot realize the science of God, and without this knowledge, any welfare activities or humanitarian propaganda cannot be successful. The Lord is puruña, or the supreme enjoyer. Not only is He the enjoyer when He appears as a manifested incarnation, but He is the enjoyer since time immemorial, from the very beginning (purätanaù), and eternally (nityam). Yac-caraëäbhivandanät: Påthu Mahäräja said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead attained this opulence of eternal fame simply by worshiping the lotus feet of the brähmaëas. In the Bhagavad-gétä it is said that the Lord does not need to work to achieve material gain. Since He is perpetually supremely perfect, He does not need to obtain anything, but still it is said that He obtained His opulences by worshiping the lotus feet of the brähmaëas. These are His exemplary actions. When Lord Çré Kåñëa was in Dvärakä, He offered His respects by bowing down at the lotus feet of Närada. When Sudämä Vipra came to His house, Lord Kåñëa personally washed his feet and gave him a seat on His personal bed. Although He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa offered His respects to Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and Kunté. The Lord's exemplary behavior is to teach us. We should learn from His personal behavior how to give protection to the cow, how to cultivate brahminical qualities and how to respect the brähmaëas and the Vaiñëavas. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä , yad yad äcarati çreñöhas tat tad evetaro janaù: \"If the leading personalities behave in a certain manner, others follow them automatically.\" Who can be more of a leading personality than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and whose behavior could be more exemplary? It is not that He needed to do all these things to acquire material gain, but all of these acts were performed just to teach us how to behave in this material world."

Within this material world, the mahattamas, or great personalities, are Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, but He is above them all. Näräyaëaù paro'vyaktät: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in a transcendental position, above everything created within this material world. His opulence, His riches, His beauty, His wisdom, His knowledge, His renunciation and His reputation are all jagat-pavitram, universally purifying. The more we discuss His opulences, the more the universe becomes purer and purer. In the material world, the opulences possessed by a material person are never fixed. Today one may be a very rich man, but tomorrow he may become poor; today one is very famous, but tomorrow he may be infamous. Materially obtained opulences are never fixed, but all six opulences perpetually exist in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not only in the spiritual world, but also in this material world. Lord Kåñëa's reputation is fixed, and His book of wisdom, Bhagavad-gétä, is still honored. Everything pertaining to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally existing."
