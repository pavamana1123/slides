    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is everlastingly independent and who exists in everyone's heart, is very pleased with those who follow in His footsteps and engage without reservation in the service of the descendants of brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas, for He is always dear to brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas and they are always dear to Him.",

He does not need any service from anyone because He is complete, but it is in our own interest to offer all kinds of services to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These services can be offered to the Supreme Person not directly but through the service of brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura sings, chäòiyä vaiñëava-sevä nistära päyeche kebä, which means that unless one serves the Vaiñëavas and brähmaëas, one cannot get liberation from the material clutches. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura also says, yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädaù: by satisfying the senses of the spiritual master, one can satisfy the senses of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus this behavior is not only mentioned in scriptures but also followed by äcäryas. Påthu Mahäräja advised his citizens to follow the exemplary behavior of the Lord Himself and thus engage in the service of brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas."
