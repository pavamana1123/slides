    "translation": "In brahminical culture a brähmaëa's transcendental position is eternally maintained because the injunctions of the Vedas are accepted with faith, austerity, scriptural conclusions, full sense and mind control, and meditation. In this way the real goal of life is illuminated, just as one's face is fully reflected in a clear mirror.",

In the age of Kali, taking advantage of the fact that by feeding a brähmaëa one obtains a more effective result than by performing sacrifices, a class of men with no brahminical qualifications claim the eating privilege known as brähmaëa-bhojana simply on the basis of their birth in brähmaëa families. In order to distinguish this class of men from the real brähmaëas, Mahäräja Påthu is giving an exact description of a brähmaëa and brahminical culture. One should not take advantage of his position simply to live like a fire without light. A brähmaëa must be fully conversant with the Vedic conclusion, which is described in Bhagavad-gétä.

His situation is transcendental, for he is free from the four defects of conditional life, which are the tendencies to commit mistakes, to be illusioned, to cheat and to possess imperfect senses. A perfect Vaiñëava, or Kåñëa conscious person, is always in this transcendental position because he speaks according to Kåñëa and His representative. Because Vaiñëavas speak exactly according to the tune of Kåñëa, whatever they say is free from these four defects. For example, Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä that everyone should always think of Him, everyone should become His devotee, offer Him obeisances and worship Him, and ultimately everyone should surrender unto Him. These devotional activities are transcendental and free from mistakes, illusion, cheating and imperfection. Therefore anyone who is a sincere devotee of Lord Kåñëa and who preaches this cult, speaking only on the basis of Kåñëa's instructions, is understood to be virajam, or free from the defects of material contamination. A genuine brähmaëa or Vaiñëava therefore depends eternally on the conclusion of the Vedas or Vedic versions presented by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. Only from Vedic knowledge can we understand the actual position of the Absolute Truth, who, as described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, is manifested in three features—namely impersonal Brahman, localized Paramätmä and, at last, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This knowledge is perfect from time immemorial, and the brahminical or Vaiñëava culture depends on this principle eternally. One should therefore study the Vedas with faith, not only for one's personal knowledge, but for the sake of spreading this knowledge and these activities through real faith in the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Vedas."

            "content": "The word maìgala (\"auspicious\") in this verse is very significant. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé quotes that to do what is good and to reject what is not good is called maìgala, or auspicious. To do what is good means to accept everything favorable to the discharge of devotional service, and to reject what is not good means to reject everything not favorable for discharging devotional service. In our Kåñëa consciousness movement, we accept this principle by rejecting four prohibited items—namely illicit sex life, intoxication, gambling and flesh—eating—and accepting the daily chanting of at least sixteen rounds of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra and daily meditation three times a day by chanting the Gäyatré mantra. In this way one can keep his brahminical culture and spiritual strength intact. By following these principles of devotional service strictly, chanting twenty-four hours a day the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—one makes positive progress in spiritual life and ultimately becomes completely fit to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. Because the ultimate goal of studying or understanding the Vedic knowledge is to find Kåñëa, one who follows the Vedic principles as described above can from the very beginning see all the features of Lord Kåñëa, the Absolute Truth, very distinctly, as one can see one's own face completely reflected in a clear mirror. The conclusion is, therefore, that a brähmaëa does not become a brähmaëa simply because he is a living entity or is born in a brähmaëa family; he must possess all the qualities mentioned in the çästras and practice the brahminical principles in his life. Thus he ultimately becomes a fully Kåñëa conscious person and can understand what Kåñëa is. How a devotee continuously sees Kåñëa face to face within his heart is described in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38) as follows:"
