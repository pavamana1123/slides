    "translation": "Whoever acquires the brahminical qualifications—whose only wealth is good behavior, who is grateful and who takes shelter of experienced persons—gets all the opulence of the world. I therefore wish that the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His associates be pleased with the brähmaëa class, with the cows and with me.",

Thus it is clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead respects and protects the brähmaëas and brahminical culture, as well as the cows; in other words, wherever there are brähmaëas and brahminical culture, there are cows and cow protection. In a society or civilization in which there are no brähmaëas or brahminical culture, cows are treated as ordinary animals and slaughtered, at the sacrifice of human civilization. The specific mention of the word gaväm by Påthu Mahäräja is significant because the Lord is always associated with cows and His devotees. In pictures Lord Kåñëa is always seen with cows and His associates such as the cowherd boys and the gopés. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot be alone. Therefore Påthu Mahäräja said, sänucaraç ca, indicating that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always associated with His followers and devotees."

            "content": "A devotee acquires all the good qualities of the demigods; he is guëäyanam, the reservoir of all good qualities. His only asset is good behavior, and he is grateful. Gratitude for the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is one of the qualities of brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas. Everyone should feel grateful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He is maintaining all living entities and supplying all their necessities. As stated in the Vedas (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13), eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän: the supreme one is supplying all necessities to the living entities. The living entity who is therefore grateful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly qualified with good characteristics."

            "content": "The word våddhäçrayam is very significant in this verse. Våddha refers to one who is advanced in knowledge. There are two kinds of old men—he who is advanced in years and he who is experienced in knowledge. One who is advanced in knowledge is actually våddha (jïäna-våddha); one does not become våddha simply by advancing in age. Våddhäçrayam, a person who takes shelter of a superior person who is advanced in knowledge, can acquire all the good qualities of a brähmaëa and be trained in good behavior. When one actually attains good qualities, becomes grateful for the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and takes shelter of a bona fide spiritual master, he is endowed with all opulence. Such a person is a brähmaëa or Vaiñëava. Therefore Påthu Mahäräja invokes the blessings and mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with His associates, devotees, Vaiñëavas, brähmaëas and cows."
