The first procedure in receiving guests is to wash their feet, and it is learned from Vedic literature that one time when Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira performed a räjasüya-yajïa, Kåñëa took charge of washing the feet of the visitors. Similarly, Mahäräja Påthu also arranged for the proper reception of the demigods, the saintly sages, the brähmaëas and the great kings."
