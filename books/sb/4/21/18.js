    "translation": "As Mahäräja Påthu was being initiated to perform the sacrifice, he had to leave aside his valuable dress, and therefore his natural bodily beauty was visible. It was very pleasing to see him put on a black deerskin and wear a ring of kuça grass on his finger, for this increased the natural beauty of his body. It appears that Mahäräja Påthu observed all the regulative principles before he performed the sacrifice.",
