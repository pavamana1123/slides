While performing a fire sacrifice, one pronounces the word svähä in mantras such as indräya svähä and ädityäya svähä. These mantras are uttered to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead through demigods such as Indra and Aditya, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead says:"

Therefore to feed brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas is to feed the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly. It may be concluded that instead of offering fire sacrifices, one should offer foodstuffs to brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas, for that process is more effective than fire yajïa. The vivid example of this principle in action was given by Advaita Prabhu. When He performed the çräddha ceremony for His father, He first of all called Haridäsa Öhäkura and offered him food. It is the practice that after finishing the çräddha ceremony, one should offer food to an elevated brähmaëa. But Advaita Prabhu offered food first to Haridäsa Öhäkura, who had taken his birth in a Muhammadan family. Therefore Haridäsa Öhäkura asked Advaita Prabhu why He was doing something which might jeopardize His position in brähmaëa society. Advaita Prabhu replied that He was feeding millions of first-class brähmaëas by offering the food to Haridäsa Öhäkura. He was prepared to talk with any learned brähmaëa on this point and prove definitely that by offering food to a pure devotee like Haridäsa Öhäkura, He was equally as blessed as He would have been by offering food to thousands of learned brähmaëas. When performing sacrifices, one offers oblations to the sacrificial fire, but when such oblations are offered to Vaiñëavas, they are certainly more effective."
