Since there was a great assembly in the arena of sacrifice, there were different types of men present, but he was especially interested in speaking to those who were not atheists. It has already been explained in the previous verses that Påthu Mahäräja advised the citizens to become adhokñaja-dhiyaù, which means God conscious, or Kåñëa conscious, and in this verse he specifically presents the authority of çästra, even though his father was a number one atheist who did not abide by the injunctions mentioned in the Vedic çästras, who practically stopped all sacrificial performances and who so disgusted the brähmaëas that they not only dethroned him but cursed and killed him. Atheistic men do not believe in the existence of God, and thus they understand everything which is happening in our daily affairs to be due to physical arrangement and chance. Atheists believe in the atheistic Säìkhya philosophy of the combination of prakåti and puruña. They believe only in matter and hold that matter under certain conditions of amalgamation gives rise to the living force, which then appears as puruña, the enjoyer; then, by a combination of matter and the living force, the many varieties of material manifestation come into existence. Nor do atheists believe in the injunctions of the Vedas. According to them, all the Vedic injunctions are simply theories that have no practical application in life. Taking all this into consideration, Påthu Mahäräja suggested that theistic men will solidly reject the views of the atheists on the grounds that there cannot be many varieties of existence without the plan of a superior intelligence. Atheists very vaguely explain that these varieties of existence occur simply by chance, but the theists who believe in the injunctions of the Vedas must reach all their conclusions under the direction of the Vedas."

The rules and regulations set up for the execution of the duties of brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras or brahmacärés, gåhasthas, vänaprasthas and sannyäsés are all meant to satisfy the Supreme Lord. At the present moment, although the so-called brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras have lost their original culture, they claim to be brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras by birthright. Yet they have rejected the proposition that such social and spiritual orders are especially meant for worship of Lord Viñëu. The dangerous Mäyäväda theory set forth by Çaìkaräcärya—that God is impersonal—does not tally with the injunctions of the Vedas. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu therefore described the Mäyävädé philosophers as the greatest offenders against the Personality of Godhead. According to the Vedic system, one who does not abide by the orders of the Vedas is called a nästika, or atheist. When Lord Buddha preached his theory of nonviolence, he was obliged to deny the authority of the Vedas, and for this reason he was considered by the followers of the Vedas to be a nästika. But although Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu very clearly enunciated that the followers of Lord Buddha's philosophy are nästikas, or atheists, because of their denial of the authority of the Vedas, He considered the Çaìkarites, who wanted to establish Vedic authority by trickery and who actually followed the Mäyäväda philosophy of Buddha's school, to be more dangerous than the Buddhists themselves. The Çaìkarite philosophers' theory that we have to imagine a shape of God is more dangerous than denial of the existence of God. Notwithstanding all the philosophical theorizing by atheists or Mäyävädés, the followers of Kåñëa consciousness rigidly live according to the injunctions given in Bhagavad-gétä, which is accepted as the essence of all Vedic scripture. In Bhagavad-gétä  it is said:"

In this verse it is clearly said that persons who are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are the lowest of mankind and are very mischievous. Under the regulative principles of the Supreme, such mischievous persons are thrown into the darkest region of material existence and are born of asuras, or atheists. Birth after birth, such asuras go still further down, finally to animal forms like those of tigers or similar ferocious beasts. Thus for millions of years they have to remain in darkness without knowledge of Kåñëa."

He is a person like all other living entities, but He is the leader or the best of all living beings. That is stated in the Vedas also. Nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13). He is the chief of all eternals, the chief of all living entities, and He is complete and full. He has no need to derive benefit by interfering with the affairs of other living entities, but because He is the maintainer of all, He has the right to bring them to the proper standard so that all living entities may become happy. A father wants all of his children to become happy under his direction. Similarly, God, or Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has the right to see that all living entities are happy. There is no possibility of becoming happy within this material world. The father and the sons are eternal, but if a living entity does not come to the platform of his eternal life of bliss and knowledge, there is no question of happiness. Although Puruñottama, the best of all living entities, has no benefit to derive from the common living entities, He does have the right to discriminate between their right and wrong ways. The right way is the path of activities meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as we have already discussed (svanuñöhitasya dharmasya saàsiddhir hari-toñaëam ). A living entity may engage in any occupational duty, but if he wants to have perfection in his duties, he must satisfy the Supreme Lord. As such, one who pleases Him gets better facilities for living, but one who displeases Him gets involved in undesirable situations."

Yajïärthät karmaëo'nyatra loko'yaà karma-bandhanaù: \"Work done as a sacrifice for Viñëu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world.\"  Karma-bandhanaù, or the bondage of karma, is administered under the regulations of the stringent laws of material nature. Material existence is a struggle to conquer the impediments put forth by material nature. The asuras are always fighting to overcome these impediments, and by the illusory power of material nature the foolish living entities work very hard within this material world and take this to be happiness. This is called mäyä. In that hard struggle for existence, they deny the existence of the supreme authority, Puruñottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Material existence, or the sense gratification process, is conducted according to the type of body we are given by prakåti, or material nature.

Varieties of life, therefore, develop not by chance but by prearrangement. There is a plan, which is already outlined in the Vedic knowledge.
