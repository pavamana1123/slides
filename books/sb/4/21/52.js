This is admitted in this verse by the citizens of Mahäräja Påthu, who could maintain the wonderful situation of his government due to his position in pure goodness. The word vivåddha-sattväya is significant. In the material world there are three qualities—namely goodness, passion and ignorance. One has to be raised from the platform of ignorance to the platform of goodness by devotional service. There is no other means for elevating one from the lowest stage of life to the highest stage but the execution of devotional service; as advised in the previous chapters of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, one can raise himself from the lowest position to the highest simply by associating with devotees and hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam regularly from their mouths."

            "content": "\"When one engages in devotional service in the first stages of hearing and chanting, the Lord, who is in everyone's heart, helps the devotee in cleansing his heart.\"  In the gradual cleansing process, one is relieved of the influence of passion and ignorance and is situated on the platform of goodness. The result of association with the qualities of passion and ignorance is that one becomes lusty and greedy. But when one is elevated to the platform of goodness, he is satisfied in any condition of life and is without lust and greed. This mentality indicates one's situation on the platform of goodness. One has to transcend this goodness and raise himself to the pure goodness called vivåddha-sattva, or the advanced stage of goodness. In the advanced stage of goodness one can become Kåñëa conscious. Therefore Mahäräja Påthu is addressed here as vivåddha-sattva, or one who is situated in the transcendental position. But Mahäräja Påthu, although situated in the transcendental position of a pure devotee, came down to the position of brähmaëa and kñatriya for the benefit of human society and thus gave protection to the entire world by his personal prowess. Although he was a king, a kñatriya, because he was a Vaiñëava he was also a brähmaëa. As a brähmaëa he could give proper instruction to the citizens, and as a kñatriya he could rightly give protection to all of them. Thus the citizens of Mahäräja Påthu were protected in all respects by the perfect king."
