            "content": "In this verse the word sädhavaù (\"all great souls\") is very significant. When a person is very great and famous, many unscrupulous persons become his enemies, for envy is the nature of materialists. In any meeting there are different classes of men, and it is to be supposed, therefore, that because Påthu Mahäräja was very great, he must have had several enemies present in the assembly, although they could not express themselves. Mahäräja Påthu, however, was concerned with persons who were gentle, and therefore he first addressed all the honest persons, not caring for the envious. He did not, however, present himself as a royal authority empowered to command everyone, for he wanted to present his statement in humble submission before the assembly of great sages and saintly persons. As a great king of the entire world, he could have given them orders, but he was so humble, meek and honest that he presented his statement for approval in order to clarify his mature decision. Everyone within this material world is conditioned by the modes of material nature and therefore has four defects. But although Påthu Mahäräja was above all these, still, like an ordinary conditioned soul, he presented his statements to the great souls, sages and saintly persons present there."
