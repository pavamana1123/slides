Since the Vedic society is divided into four classes of men—the brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras—their means of livelihood are also mentioned in the scriptures. The brähmaëas should live by spreading knowledge and should therefore take contributions from their disciples, whereas a king should give protection to the citizens for their development to the highest standard of life, and he can therefore levy taxes from them; businessmen or mercantile men, because they produce foodstuffs for the whole of society, can take a little profit from this, whereas the çüdras, who cannot work as either brähmaëas, kñatriyas or vaiçyas, should give service to the higher classes of society and be provided by them with a supply of the necessities of life."

Great souls are naturally inclined to do good to others, and a Vaiñëava especially is the most compassionate and merciful personality in society. Therefore we offer our respects to a Vaiñëava leader as follows:"

He is patita-pävana, the deliverer of all fallen souls, because if the king or the head of the government follows in the footsteps of the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas, who are naturally leaders in missionary work, the vaiçyas will also follow in the footsteps of the Vaiñëavas and brähmaëas, and the çüdras will give them service. Thus the entire society becomes a perfect human institution for combined progress to the highest perfection of life."
