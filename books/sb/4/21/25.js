By doing so, you will protect your own interests, and you will bestow mercy upon your king for his welfare after death.",

The king and citizens should both be Kåñëa conscious, otherwise both of them will be doomed to lower species of life after death. A responsible government must teach Kåñëa consciousness very vigorously for the benefit of all. Without Kåñëa consciousness, neither the state nor the citizens of the state can be responsible. Påthu Mahäräja therefore specifically requested the citizens to act in Kåñëa consciousness, and he was also very anxious to teach them how to become Kåñëa conscious. A summary of Kåñëa consciousness is given in Bhagavad-gétä :"
