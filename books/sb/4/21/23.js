            "content": "Mahäräja Påthu gives special stress to the word brahma-vädinaù (\"by the experts in the Vedic knowledge\"). Brahma refers to the Vedas, which are also known as çabda-brahma, or transcendental sound. Transcendental sound is not ordinary language, although it appears to be written in ordinary language. Evidence from the Vedic literature should be accepted as final authority. In the Vedic literature there is much information, and of course there is information about the execution of a king's duty. A responsible king who executes his appointed duty by giving proper protection to all living entities on his planet is promoted to the heavenly planetary system. This is also dependent upon the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. It is not that if one executes his duty properly he is automatically promoted, for promotion depends upon the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It must ultimately be concluded that one can achieve the desired result of his activities upon satisfying the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed in the First Canto, Second Chapter, of Çrémad-Bhägavatam: \nataù pumbhir dvija-çreñöhä\nvarëäçrama-vibhägaçaù\nsvanuñöhitasya dharmasya\nsaàsiddhir hari-toñaëam\nThe perfection of one's execution of his appointed duties is the ultimate satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. The word käma-sandohäù means \"achievement of the desired result.\" Everyone desires to achieve the ultimate goal of life, but in modern civilization the great scientists think that man's life has no plan. This gross ignorance is very dangerous and makes civilization very risky. People do not know the laws of nature, which are the rulings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they are atheists of the first order, they have no faith in the existence of God and His rulings and therefore do not know how nature is working. This gross ignorance of the mass of people, including even the so-called scientists and philosophers, makes life a risky situation in which human beings do not know whether they are making progress in life. According to Çrémad-Bhägavatam , they are simply progressing to the darkest region of material existence. Adänta-gobhir viçatäà tamisram. The Kåñëa consciousness movement has therefore been started to give philosophers, scientists, and people in general the proper knowledge about the destiny of life. Everyone should take advantage of this movement and learn the real goal of life."
