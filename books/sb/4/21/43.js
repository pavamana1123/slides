    "translation": "O respectable personalities present here, I beg the blessings of all of you that I may perpetually carry on my crown the dust of the lotus feet of such brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas until the end of my life. He who can carry such dust on his head is very soon relieved of all the reactions which arise from sinful life, and eventually he develops all good and desirable qualities.",

Yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä/ sarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù . Unless one takes the dust of the lotus feet of a pure Vaiñëava on one's head, one cannot understand what the Supreme Personality of Godhead is, and unless one knows the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one's life remains imperfect. A great soul who has fully surrendered to the Supreme Lord after understanding Him fully and after repeatedly undergoing austerities and penances for many, many lives is very rare. The crown of a king is simply a big load if the king or head of the state does not actually bear the dust of the lotus feet of brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas. In other words, if a liberal king like Påthu Mahäräja does not follow the instructions of brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas or does not follow the brahminical culture, he is simply a burden on the state, for he cannot benefit the citizens. Mahäräja Påthu is the perfect example of an ideal chief executive."
