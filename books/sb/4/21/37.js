    "translation": "The brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas are personally glorified by their characteristic powers of tolerance, penance, knowledge and education. By dint of all these spiritual assets, Vaiñëavas are more powerful than royalty. It is therefore advised that the princely order not exhibit its material prowess before these two communities and should avoid offending them.",

            "content": "Påthu Mahäräja has explained in the previous verse the importance of devotional service for both the rulers and the citizens of the state. Now he explains how one can be steadily fixed in devotional service. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, while instructing Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, has compared the devotional service of the Lord with a creeper. A creeper has a feeble stem and requires the support of another tree to grow, and while growing, it requires sufficient protection so that it may not be lost. While describing the system of protection for the creeper of devotional service, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has especially stressed protection from offenses unto the lotus feet of Vaiñëavas. Such offenses are called vaiñëava-aparädha. Aparädha means \"offense.\" If one commits vaiñëava-aparädhas, all of his progress in devotional service will be checked. Even though one is very much advanced in devotional service, if he commits offenses at the feet of a Vaiñëava, his advancement is all spoiled. In the çästras it is found that a very great yogé, Durväsä Muni, committed a vaiñëava-aparädha and thus for one full year had to travel all over the universe, even to Vaikuëöhaloka, to defend himself from the offense. At last, even when he approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vaikuëöha, he was refused protection. Therefore one should be very careful about committing offenses at the feet of a Vaiñëava. The most grievous type of vaiñëava-aparädha is called gurv-aparädha, which refers to offenses at the lotus feet of the spiritual master. In the chanting of the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this gurv-aparädha is considered the most grievous offense. Guror avajïä çruti-çästra-nindanam (Padma Puräëa). Among the ten offenses committed against the chanting of the holy name, the first offenses are disobedience of the spiritual master and blasphemy of the Vedic literature."

            "content": "The simple definition of Vaiñëava is given by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu: a person who immediately reminds one of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is a Vaiñëava. In this verse, both Vaiñëavas and brähmaëas are mentioned. A Vaiñëava is a learned brähmaëa and is therefore designated as brähmaëa-vaiñëava, brähmaëa-paëòita or as a Vaiñëava and brähmaëa. In other words, a Vaiñëava is supposed to be a brähmaëa already, but a brähmaëa may not be a pure Vaiñëava. When a person understands his pure identity, brahma jänäti, he immediately becomes a brähmaëa. In the brähmaëa stage, one's understanding of the Absolute Truth is mainly based on the impersonal view. When a brähmaëa, however, rises to the platform of personal understanding of the Supreme Godhead, he becomes a Vaiñëava. A Vaiñëava is transcendental even to a brähmaëa. In the material conception, the position of a brähmaëa is the highest in human society, but a Vaiñëava is transcendental even to a brähmaëa. Both the brähmaëa and Vaiñëava are spiritually advanced. A brähmaëa's qualifications are mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä as truthfulness, mental equanimity, control of the senses, the power of tolerance, simplicity, knowledge of the Absolute Truth, firm faith in the scriptures, and practical application of the brahminical qualities in life. In addition to all these qualifications, when one fully engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he becomes a Vaiñëava. Påthu Mahäräja warns his citizens who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the Lord to take care against offenses to the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas. Offenses at their lotus feet are so destructive that even the descendants of Yadu who were born in the family of Lord Kåñëa were destroyed due to offenses at their feet. The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot tolerate any offense at the lotus feet of brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas. Sometimes, due to their powerful positions, princes or government servants neglect the position of brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas, not knowing that because of their offense they will be ruined."
