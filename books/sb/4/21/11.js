    "translation": "The great saintly sage Maitreya told Vidura: My dear Vidura, King Påthu lived in the tract of land between the two great rivers Ganges and Yamunä. Because he was very opulent, it appeared that he was enjoying his destined fortune in order to diminish the results of his past pious activities.",

            "content": "The terms \"pious\" and \"impious\" are applicable only in reference to the activities of an ordinary living being. But Mahäräja Påthu was a directly empowered incarnation of Lord Viñëu; therefore he was not subject to the reactions of pious or impious activities. As we have already explained previously, when a living being is specifically empowered by the Supreme Lord to act for a particular purpose, he is called a çaktyäveça-avatära. Påthu Mahäräja was not only a çaktyäveça-avatära but also a great devotee. A devotee is not subjected to the reactions resulting from past deeds. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is said, karmäëi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhäjäm: (BS 5.54) for devotees the results of past pious and impious activities are nullified by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words ärabdhän eva mean \"as if achieved by past deeds,\" but in the case of Påthu Mahäräja there was no question of reaction to past deeds, and thus the word eva is used here to indicate comparison to ordinary persons. In Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says, avajänanti mäà müòhäù . This means that sometimes people misunderstand an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be an ordinary man. The Supreme Godhead, His incarnations or His devotees may pose themselves as ordinary men, but they are never to be considered as such. Nor should an ordinary man not supported by authorized statements of the çästras and äcäryas be accepted as an incarnation or devotee. By the evidence of çästra, Sanätana Gosvämé detected Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu to be a direct incarnation of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although Lord Caitanya never disclosed the fact. It is therefore generally recommended that the äcärya, or guru, should not be accepted as an ordinary man."
