    "translation": "By regular service to the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas, one can clear the dirt from his heart and thus enjoy supreme peace and liberation from material attachment and be satisfied. In this world there is no fruitive activity superior to serving the brähmaëa class, for this can bring pleasure to the demigods, for whom the many sacrifices are recommended.",

Therefore it is essential to render service to the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas to achieve the perfection of self-satisfaction. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura therefore says:"

The spiritual master is the best brähmaëa. At present, in the age of Kali, it is very difficult to render service to the brähmaëa-kula, or the brähmaëa class. The difficulty, according to the Varäha Puräëa, is that demons, taking advantage of Kali-yuga, have taken birth in brähmaëa families. Räkñasäù kalim äçritya jäyante brahma-yoniñu (Varäha Puräëa). In other words, in this age there are many so-called caste brähmaëas and caste Gosvämés who, taking advantage of the çästra and of the innocence of people in general, claim to be brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas by hereditary right. One will not derive any benefit by rendering service to such false brähmaëa-kulas. One must therefore take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and his associates and should also render service to them, for such activity will greatly help the neophyte in attaining full satisfaction. This has been very clearly explained by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura in his explanation of the verse vyavasäyätmikä buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana . By actually following the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga as recommended by Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura, one can very quickly come to the transcendental platform of liberation, as explained in this verse (atyanta-çamam)."

            "content": "The particular use of the word anativelam (\"without delay\") is very significant because simply by serving brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas one can get liberation. There is no need to undergo severe penances and austerities. The vivid example of this is Närada Muni himself. In his previous birth, he was simply a maidservant's son, but he got the opportunity to serve exalted brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas, and thus in his next life he not only became liberated, but became famous as the supreme spiritual master of the entire Vaiñëava disciplic succession. According to the Vedic system, therefore, it is customarily recommended that after performing a ritualistic ceremony, one should feed the brähmaëas."
