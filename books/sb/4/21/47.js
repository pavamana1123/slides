    "translation": "Similarly, Hiraëyakaçipu, who by dint of his sinful activities always defied the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, entered into the darkest region of hellish life; but by the grace of his great son, Prahläda Mahäräja, he also was delivered and went back home, back to Godhead.",

The rendering of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in expectation of a good reward is deprecated by Prahläda Mahäräja as mercantile business. Because Prahläda Mahäräja was a Vaiñëava, he did not ask a benediction for his personal self but was very affectionate toward his father. Although his father tortured him and would have killed him had he himself not been killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Prahläda Mahäräja begged pardon for him from the Lord. This favor was immediately granted by the Lord, and Hiraëyakaçipu was delivered from the darkest region of hellish life, and he returned back home, back to Godhead, by the grace of his son. Prahläda Mahäräja is the topmost example of a Vaiñëava, who is always compassionate toward sinful persons suffering a hellish life within this material world. Kåñëa is therefore known as para-duùkha-duùkhé kåpämbudhiù, or one who is compassionate toward others' suffering and who is an ocean of mercy. Like Prahläda Mahäräja, all pure devotees of the Lord come to this material world with full compassion to deliver the sinful. They undergo all kinds of tribulations, suffering them with tolerance, because that is another qualification of a Vaiñëava, who tries to deliver all sinful persons from the hellish conditions of material existence. Vaiñëavas are therefore offered the following prayer:"
