    "translation": "Lord Brahmä, the master of the entire universe, arrived there accompanied by all the demigods and their chiefs. Seeing the lines of Lord Viñëu's palm on King Påthu's right hand and impressions of lotus flowers on the soles of his feet, Lord Brahmä could understand that King Påthu was a partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One whose palm bears the sign of a disc, as well as other such lines, should be considered a partial representation or incarnation of the Supreme Lord.",

            "content": "There is a system by which one can detect an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nowadays it has become a cheap fashion to accept any rascal as an incarnation of God, but from this incident we can see that Lord Brahmä personally examined the hands and feet of King Påthu for specific signs. In their prophecies the learned sages and brähmaëas accepted Påthu Mahäräja as a plenary partial expansion of the Lord. During the presence of Lord Kåñëa, however, a king declared himself Väsudeva, and Lord Kåñëa killed him. Before accepting someone as an incarnation of God, one should verify his identity according to the symptoms mentioned in the çästras. Without these symptoms the pretender is subject to be killed by the authorities for pretending to be an incarnation of God."
