In the çästras it is said that Garuòa (the carrier of Lord Viñëu) and Lord Çiva and Ananta are all very powerful incarnations of the Brahman feature of the Lord. Similarly, Çacépati, or Indra, the King of heaven, is an incarnation of the lusty feature of the Lord. Aniruddha is an incarnation of the Lord's mind. Similarly, King Påthu is an incarnation of the ruling force of the Lord. Thus the saintly persons and great sages predicted the future activities of King Påthu, who was already explained as a partial incarnation of a plenary expansion of the Lord."
