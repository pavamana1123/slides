People in the material world are very fond of the goddess of fortune, and they want her favor in the form of riches. They should know, however, that the goddess of fortune is inseparable from Lord Viñëu. Materialists should understand that the goddess of fortune should be worshiped along with Lord Viñëu and should not be regarded separately. Materialists seeking the favor of the goddess of fortune must worship Lord Viñëu and Lakñmé together to maintain material opulence. If a materialist follows the policy of Rävaëa, who wanted to separate Sétä from Lord Rämacandra, the process of separation will vanquish him. Those who are very rich and have taken favor of the goddess of fortune in this world must engage their money in the service of the Lord. In this way they can continue in their opulent position without disturbance."
