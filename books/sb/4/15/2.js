They removed all the reactions of King Vena's sinful activities by seeing that King Vena first gave birth to Bähuka, described in the previous chapter. After King Vena's body was thus purified, a male and female came out of it, and the great sages could understand that this was an expansion of Lord Viñëu. This expansion, of course, was not viñëu-tattva but a specifically empowered expansion of Lord Viñëu known as äveça."
