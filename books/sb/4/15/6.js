There are innumerable such personalities, but not all of them are direct viñëu-tattva plenary expansions of the Lord. Many living entities are classified among the çakti-tattvas. Such incarnations, empowered for specific purposes, are known as çaktyäveça-avatäras. King Påthu was such a çaktyäveça-avatära of the Lord. Similarly, Arci, King Påthu's wife, was a çaktyäveça-avatära of the goddess of fortune."
