The çüdras are sometimes called black, or kåñëa. The brähmaëas are called çukla, or white, and the kñatriyas and the vaiçyas are a mixture of black and white. However, those who are extraordinarily white are said to have skin produced out of white leprosy. It may be concluded that white or a golden hue is the color of the higher caste, and black is the complexion of the çüdras."
