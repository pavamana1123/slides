    "translation": "The great sages began to think that although a brähmaëa is peaceful and impartial because he is equal to everyone, it is still not his duty to neglect poor humans. By such neglect, a brähmaëa's spiritual power diminishes, just as water kept in a cracked pot leaks out.",

They are generally unaware of the happenings within the material world because they are always busy in their activities for spiritual advancement. Nonetheless, when there is a calamity in human society, they cannot remain impartial. If they do not do something to relieve the distressed condition of human society, it is said that due to such neglect their spiritual knowledge diminishes. Almost all the sages go to the Himalayas for their personal benefit, but Prahläda Mahäräja said that he did not want liberation alone. He decided to wait until he was able to deliver all the fallen souls of the world."

A qualified brähmaëa is naturally very learned, but when his learning is advanced in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes a brähmaëa-vaiñëava. Unless one becomes a Vaiñëava, one's perfection of brahminical culture is incomplete."

Therefore the semen in the family must be protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Keçava. As such, the sages wanted to take some steps to relieve the situation. For want of a king, everything was being disturbed and turned topsy-turvy."
