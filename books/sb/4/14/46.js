We should, however, know that even these sinful men (who are sometimes called Kirätas) can be delivered from their sinful condition to the topmost Vaiñëava platform by the mercy of a pure devotee. Engagement in the transcendental loving devotional service of the Lord can make anyone, however sinful he may be, fit to return home, back to Godhead. One has only to become free from all contamination by the process of devotional service. In this way everyone can become fit to return home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä :"
