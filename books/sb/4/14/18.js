The activities of the government head, or king, as well as the activities of the citizens, should be so directed that ultimately everyone engages in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The king, or government head, is supposed to be the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is therefore supposed to see that things go on nicely and that the citizens are situated in the scientific social order comprised of four varëas and four äçramas. In the Viñëu Puräëa it is stated that unless people are educated or situated in the scientific social order comprised of four varëas (brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra) and four äçramas (brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa), society can never be considered real human society, nor can it make any advancement towards the ultimate goal of human life. It is the duty of the government to see that things go on in terms of varëa and äçrama. As stated herein, bhagavän yajïa-püruñaù—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the yajïa-püruña. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä :"

In this way everyone can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu. The king, or government head, has to see that the citizens are thus engaged. In other words, the state or the government must not deviate from its duty by declaring that the state is a secular one, which has no interest in whether or not the people advance in varëäçrama-dharma. Today people engaged in government service and people who rule over the citizens have no respect for the varëäçrama-dharma. They complacently feel that the state is secular. In such a government, no one can be happy. The people must follow the varëäçrama-dharma, and the king must see that they are following it nicely."
