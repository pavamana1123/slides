            "content": "In this verse the word añöa-vibhütibhiù, meaning \"by eight opulences,\" is very important. The king is supposed to possess eight kinds of opulences. By dint of mystic yoga practice, kings generally acquired these eight opulences. These kings were called räjarñis, kings who were also great sages. By practicing mystic yoga, a räjarñi could become smaller than the smallest, greater than the greatest, and could get whatever he desired. A räjarñi could also create a kingdom, bring everyone under his control and rule everyone. These were some of the opulences of a king. King Vena, however, was not practiced in yoga, but he became very proud of his royal position nonetheless. Because he was not very considerate, he began to misuse his power and insult great personalities."
