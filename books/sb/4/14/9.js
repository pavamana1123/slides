    "translation": "Thinking to save the state from irregularity, the sages began to consider that it was due to a political crisis that they made Vena king although he was not qualified.

            "content": "In Bhagavad-gétä  it is stated that even in the renounced order one should not give up sacrifice, charity and penance. The brahmacärés must perform sacrifices, the gåhasthas must give in charity, and those in the renounced order of life (the vänaprasthas and sannyäsés) must practice penance and austerities. These are the procedures by which everyone can be elevated to the spiritual platform. When the sages and saintly persons saw that King Vena had stopped all these functions, they became concerned about the people's progress. Saintly people preach God consciousness, or Kåñëa consciousness, because they are anxious to save the general populace from the dangers of animalistic life. There must be a good government to see that the citizens are actually executing their religious rituals, and thieves and rogues must be curbed. When this is done, the people can advance peacefully in spiritual consciousness and make their lives successful."
