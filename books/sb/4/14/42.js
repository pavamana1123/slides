            "content": "The purity of hereditary succession is called amogha-vérya. The pious seminal succession in the twice-born families of the brähmaëas and kñatriyas especially, as well as in the families of vaiçyas also, must be kept very pure by the observation of the purificatory processes beginning with garbhädhäna-saàskära, which is observed before conceiving a child. Unless this purificatory process is strictly observed, especially by the brähmaëas, the family descendants become impure, and gradually sinful activities become visible in the family. Mahäräja Aìga was very pure because of the purification of semen in the family of Mahäräja Dhruva. However, his semen became contaminated in association with his wife, Sunéthä, who happened to be the daughter of death personified. Because of this polluted semen, King Vena was produced. This was a catastrophe in the family of Dhruva Mahäräja. All the saintly persons and sages considered this point, and they decided to take action in this matter, as described in the following verses."
