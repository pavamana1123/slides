    "translation": "The reciters continued: Dear King, you are a direct incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viñëu, and by His causeless mercy you have descended on this earth. Therefore it is not possible for us to actually glorify your exalted activities. Although you have appeared through the body of King Vena, even great orators and speakers like Lord Brahmä and other demigods cannot exactly describe the glorious activities of Your Lordship.",

            "content": "In this verse the word mäyayä means \"by your causeless mercy.\" The Mäyävädé philosophers explain the word mäyä as meaning \"illusion\" or \"falseness.\" However, there is another meaning of mäyä—that is, \"causeless mercy.\" There are two kinds of mäyä-yogamäyä and mahämäyä. Mahämäyä is an expansion of yogamäyä, and both these mäyäs are different expressions of the Lord's internal potencies. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord appears through His internal potencies (ätma-mäyayä). We should therefore reject the Mäyäväda explanation that the Lord appears in a body given by the external potency, the material energy. The Lord and His incarnation are fully independent and can appear anywhere and everywhere by virtue of the internal potency. Although born out of the so-called dead body of King Vena, King Påthu was still an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the Lord's internal potency. The Lord can appear in any family. Sometimes He appears as a fish incarnation (matsya-avatära) or a boar incarnation (varäha-avatära). Thus the Lord is completely free and independent to appear anywhere and everywhere by His internal potency. It is stated that Ananta, an incarnation of the Lord who has unlimited mouths, cannot reach the end of His glorification of the Lord, although Ananta has been describing the Lord since time immemorial. So what to speak of demigods like Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and others? It is said that the Lord is çiva-viriïci-nutam -always worshiped by demigods like Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä. If the demigods cannot find adequate language to express the glories of the Lord, then what to speak of others? Consequently reciters like the süta and mägadha felt inadequate to speak about King Påthu."

            "content": "By glorifying the Lord with exalted verses, one becomes purified. Although we are unable to offer prayers to the Lord in an adequate fashion, our duty is to make the attempt in order to purify ourselves. It is not that we should stop our glorification because demigods like Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva cannot adequately glorify the Lord. Rather, as stated by Prahläda Mahäräja, everyone should glorify the Lord according to his own ability. If we are serious and sincere devotees, the Lord will give us the intelligence to offer prayers properly."
