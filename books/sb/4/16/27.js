Just as there are many united states in various parts of the world, in olden days the entire world was ruled through many states, but there was a supreme emperor who ruled over all subsidiary states. As soon as there were some discrepancies in the maintenance of the varëäçrama system, the emperor would immediately take charge of the small states."

            "content": "The word utpäöita-loka-çalyaù indicates that Mahäräja Påthu completely uprooted all the miseries of his citizens. The word çalya means \"piercing thorns.\" There are many kinds of miserable thorns that pierce the citizens of a state, but all competent rulers, even up to the reign of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, uprooted all the miserable conditions of the citizens. It is stated that during the reign of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira there did not even exist severe cold or scorching heat, nor did the citizens suffer from any kind of mental anxiety. This is the standard of good government. Such a peaceful and prosperous government, devoid of anxiety, was established by Påthu Mahäräja. Thus the inhabitants of both saintly and demoniac planets were all engaged in glorifying the activities of Mahäräja Påthu. Persons or nations anxious to spread their influence all over the world should consider this point. If one is able to eradicate completely the threefold miseries of the citizens, he should aspire to rule the world. One should not aspire to rule for any political or diplomatic consideration."
