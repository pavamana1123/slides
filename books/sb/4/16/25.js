When a person is properly instructed by a spiritual master and understands transcendental bliss, he enjoys life. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä na çocati na käìkñati. When one attains to the Brahman platform, he neither hankers nor laments. He actually partakes of transcendental, blissful enjoyment. Although King Påthu was an incarnation of Viñëu, he nonetheless taught the people in his kingdom to take instructions from a spiritual master who represents the disciplic succession. Thus one can become fortunate and enjoy a blissful life even within this material world. In this verse the verb vidanti is sometimes taken to mean \"understanding.\" Thus when a person understands Brahman, or the supreme source of everything, he enjoys a blissful life."
