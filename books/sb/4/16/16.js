This Sanskrit word indicates that one can be older by the advancement of knowledge. King Påthu was very respectful to the brähmaëas, and he protected them. He also protected persons advanced in age. Whatever the King would decide to do, no one would be able to stop. That is called dåòha-saìkalpa, or dåòha-vrata."
