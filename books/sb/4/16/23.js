    "translation": "When the lion travels in the forest with its tail turned upward, all menial animals hide themselves. Similarly, when King Påthu will travel over his kingdom and vibrate the string of his bow, which is made of the horns of goats and bulls and is irresistible in battle, all demoniac rogues and thieves will hide themselves in all directions.",

In India, kñatriya kings are still called siìgh, which means \"lion.\" Unless rogues, thieves and other demoniac people in a state are afraid of the executive head, who rules the kingdom with a strong hand, there cannot be peace or prosperity in the state. Thus it is most regrettable when a woman becomes the executive head instead of a lionlike king. In such a situation the people are considered very unfortunate."
