Although Mahäräja Påthu was simply enthroned on the royal seat and was not at that time exhibiting his godly powers, the reciters like the süta, the mägadha and the vandé understood that King Påthu was an incarnation of God. They could understand this by the instructions given by the great sages and learned brähmaëas. We have to understand the incarnations of God by the instructions of authorized persons. We cannot manufacture a God by our own concoctions. As stated by Narottama däsa Öhäkura, sädhu-çästra-guru: one has to test all spiritual matters according to the instructions of saintly persons, scriptures and the spiritual master. The spiritual master is one who follows the instructions of his predecessors, namely the sädhus, or saintly persons. A bona fide spiritual master does not mention anything not mentioned in the authorized scriptures. Ordinary people have to follow the instructions of sädhu, çästra and guru. Those statements made in the çästras and those made by the bona fide sädhu or guru cannot differ from one another."

            "content": "Reciters like the süta and the mägadha were confidentially aware that King Påthu was an incarnation of the Personality of Godhead. Although the King denied such praise because he was not at that time exhibiting his godly qualities, the reciters did not stop praising him. Rather, they were very pleased with the King, who, although actually an incarnation of God, was so humble and delightful in his dealings with devotees. In this connection we may note that previously  it was mentioned that King Påthu was smiling and was in a pleasant mood while speaking to the reciters. Thus we have to learn from the Lord or His incarnation how to become gentle and humble. The King's behavior was very pleasing to the reciters, and consequently the reciters continued their praise and even foretold the King's future activities, as they had been instructed by the sädhus and sages."
