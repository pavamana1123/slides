    "translation": "King Påthu was born of the dead body of King Vena as fire is produced from araëi wood. Thus King Påthu will always remain just like fire, and his enemies will not be able to approach him. Indeed, he will be unbearable to his enemies, for although staying very near him, they will never be able to approach him but will have to remain as if far away. No one will be able to overcome the strength of King Påthu.",

Although born of his dead father, King Påthu would still remain just like fire. Just as fire is not easily approached, King Påthu would be unapproachable by his enemies, even though they would appear to be very near him."
