            "content": "In this verse the word yathärkaù indicates that the sun is not fixed but is rotating in its orbit, which is set by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä and also in other parts of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. In the Fifth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that the sun rotates in its own orbit at the rate of sixteen thousand miles per second. Similarly, Brahma-saàhitä states, yasyäjïayä bhramati sambhåta-käla-cakraù: the sun rotates in its own orbit according to the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conclusion is that the sun is not fixed in one place. As far as Påthu Mahäräja is concerned, it is indicated that his ruling power would extend all over the world. The Himalaya Mountains, from which the sunrise is first seen, are called udayäcala or udayädri. It is herein indicated that Påthu Mahäräja's reign over the world would cover even the Himalaya Mountains and extend to the borders of all oceans and seas. In other words, his reign would cover the entire planet."

            "content": "Another significant word in this verse is naradeva. As described in previous verses, the qualified king—be he King Påthu or any other king who rules over the state as an ideal king—should be understood to be God in human form. According to Vedic culture, the king is honored as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because he represents Näräyaëa, who also gives protection to the citizens. He is therefore nätha, or the proprietor. Even Sanätana Gosvämé gave respect to the Nawab Hussain Shah as naradeva, although the Nawab was Muhammadan. A king or governmental head must therefore be so competent to rule over the state that the citizens will worship him as God in human form. That is the perfectional stage for the head of any government or state."
