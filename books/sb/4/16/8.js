            "content": "King Påthu is very appropriately compared to the sun and the demigod Indra. King Indra of the heavenly planets is in charge of distributing water over the earth and other planetary systems. It is indicated that King Påthu would arrange for the distribution of rainfall personally if Indra failed to discharge his duty properly. Sometimes the King of heaven, Indra, would become angry at the inhabitants of the earth if they did not offer sacrifices to appease him. King Påthu, however, being an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, did not depend on the mercy of the heavenly King. It is foretold herein that if there would be a scarcity of rain, King Påthu would manage to counteract the deficiency by virtue of his godly powers. Such powers were also exhibited by Lord Kåñëa when He was present in Våndävana. Indeed, when Indra poured incessant water on Våndävana for seven days, the inhabitants were protected by Kåñëa, who raised Govardhana Hill over their heads as a great umbrella. Thus Lord Kåñëa is also known as Govardhana-dhäré."
