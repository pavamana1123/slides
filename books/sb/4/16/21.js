            "content": "As far as reputation is concerned, King Påthu is already known as the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word ädi-räjam means \"the original king.\" The original king is Näräyaëa, or Lord Viñëu. People do not know that the original king, or Näräyaëa, is actually the protector of all living entities. As confirmed in the Vedas: eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13). Actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead is maintaining all living entities. The king, or naradeva, is His representative. As such, the king's duty is to personally supervise the distribution of wealth for the maintenance of all living entities. If he does so, he will be as reputable as Näräyaëa. As mentioned in this verse (tad-yaçaù), Påthu Mahäräja was actually carrying with him the reputation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because he was actually reigning over the world in that capacity."
