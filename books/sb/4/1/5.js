            "content": "Sväyambhuva Manu was very glad to see that his daughter Äküti had given birth to both a boy and girl. He was afraid that he would take one son and that because of this his son-in-law Ruci might be sorry. Thus when he heard that a daughter was born along with the boy, he was very glad. Ruci, according to his promise, returned his male child to Sväyambhuva Manu and decided to keep the daughter, whose name was Dakñiëä. One of Lord Viñëu's names is Yajïa because He is the master of the Vedas. The name Yajïa comes from yajuñäà patiù, which means \"Lord of all sacrifices.\" In the Yajur Veda there are different ritualistic prescriptions for performing yajïas, and the beneficiary of all such yajïas is the Supreme Lord, Viñëu. Therefore it is stated in Bhagavad-gétä , yajïärthät karmaëaù: one should act, but one should perform one's prescribed duties only for the sake of Yajïa, or Viñëu. lf one does not act for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or if one does not perform devotional service, then there will be reactions to all one's activities. It does not matter if the reaction is good or bad; if our activities are not dovetailed with the desire of the Supreme Lord, or if we do not act in Kåñëa consciousness, then we shall be responsible for the results of all our activities. There is always a reaction to every kind of action, but if actions are performed for Yajïa, there is no reaction. Thus if one acts for Yajïa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is not entangled in the material condition, for it is mentioned in the Vedas and also in Bhagavad-gétä that the Vedas and the Vedic rituals are all meant for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. From the very beginning one should try to act in Kåñëa consciousness; that will free one from the reactions of material activities."
