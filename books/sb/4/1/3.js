            "content": "The word brahma-varcasvé is very significant. Ruci was a brähmaëa, and he executed the brahminical duties very rigidly. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, the brahminical qualifications are control of the senses, control of the mind, cleanliness within and without, development of spiritual and material knowledge, simplicity, truthfulness, faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, etc. There are many qualities which indicate a brahminical personality, and it is understood that Ruci followed all the brahminical principles rigidly. Therefore he is specifically mentioned as brahma-varcasvé. One who is born of a brähmaëa father but does not act as a brähmaëa is called, in Vedic language, a brahma-bandhu, and is calculated to be on the level of çüdras and women. Thus in the Bhägavatam we find that Mahäbhärata was specifically compiled by Vyäsadeva for stré-çüdra-brahma-bandhu . Stré means women, çüdra means the lower class of civilized human society, and brahma-bandhu means persons who are born in the families of brähmaëas but do not follow the rules and regulations carefully. All of these three classes are called less intelligent; they have no access to the study of the Vedas, which are specifically meant for persons who have acquired the brahminical qualifications. This restriction is based not upon any sectarian distinction but upon qualification. The Vedic literatures cannot be understood unless one has developed the brahminical qualifications. It is regrettable, therefore, that persons who have no brahminical qualifications and have never been trained under a bona fide spiritual master nevertheless comment on Vedic literatures like the Çrémad-Bhägavatam and other puräëas, for such persons cannot deliver their real message. Ruci was considered a first-class brähmaëa; therefore he is mentioned here as brahma-varcasvé, one who had full prowess in brahminical strength."
