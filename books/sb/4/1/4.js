    "translation": "Of the two children born of Äküti, the male child was directly an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His name was Yajïa, which is another name of Lord Viñëu. The female child was a partial incarnation of Lakñmé, the goddess of fortune, the eternal consort of Lord Viñëu.",

Here it is stated that both the Lord and Lakñmé, who are eternal consorts, appeared from Äküti simultaneously. Both the Lord and His consort are beyond this material creation, as confirmed by many authorities (näräyaëaù paro 'vyaktät); therefore their eternal relationship cannot be changed, and Yajïa, the boy born of Äküti, later married the goddess of fortune."
