Soma was a partial representation of Lord Brahmä, Dattätreya was a partial representation of Lord Viñëu, and Durväsä was a partial representation of Lord Çiva.",

The three sons born of Anasüyä—Dattätreya, Durväsä and Soma—were born as partial representations of these three demigods. Ätma is not in the category of the demigods or living entities because He is Viñëu; therefore He is described as vibhinnäàça-bhütänäm. The Supersoul, Viñëu, is the seed-giving father of all living entities, including Brahmä and Lord Çiva. Another meaning of the word ätma may be accepted in this way: the principle who is the Supersoul in every ätma, or, one may say, the soul of everyone, became manifested as Dattätreya, because the word aàça, part and parcel, is used here."

            "content": "In Bhagavad-gétä the individual souls are also described as parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or Supersoul, so why not accept that Dattätreya was one of those parts? Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä are also described here as parts, so why not accept all of them as ordinary individual souls? The answer is that the manifestations of Viñëu and those of the ordinary living entities are certainly all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and no one is equal to Him, but among the parts and parcels there are different categories. In the Varäha Puräëa it is nicely explained that some of the parts are sväàça and some are vibhinnäàça. Vibhinnäàça parts are called jévas, and sväàça parts are in the Viñëu category. In the jéva category, the vibhinnäàça parts and parcels, there are also gradations. That is explained in the Viñëu Puräëa, where it is clearly stated that the individual parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord are subject to being covered by the external energy, called illusion, or mäyä. Such individual parts and parcels, who can travel to any part of the Lord's creation, are called sarva-gata and are suffering the pangs of material existence. They are proportionately freed from the coverings of ignorance under material existence according to different levels of work and under different influences of the modes of material nature. For example, the sufferings of jévas situated in the mode of goodness are less than those of jévas situated in the mode of ignorance. Pure Kåñëa consciousness, however, is the birthright of all living entities because every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The consciousness of the Lord is also in the part and parcel, and according to the proportion to which that consciousness is cleared of material dirt, the living entities are differently situated. In the Vedänta-sütra, the living entities of different gradations are compared to candles or lamps with different candle power. For example, some electric bulbs have the power of one thousand candles, some have the power of five hundred candles, some the power of one hundred candles, some fifty candles, etc., but all electric bulbs have light. Light is present in every bulb, but the gradations of light are different. Similarly, there are gradations of Brahman. The Viñëu sväàça expansions of the Supreme Lord in different Viñëu forms are like lamps, Lord Çiva is also like a lamp, and the supreme candle power, or the one-hundred-percent light, is Kåñëa. The viñëu-tattva has ninety-four percent, the çiva-tattva has eighty-four percent, Lord Brahmä has seventy-eight percent, and the living entities are also like Brahmä, but in the conditioned state their power is still more dim. There are gradations of Brahman, and no one can deny this fact. Therefore the words ätmeça-brahma-sambhavän indicate that Dattätreya was directly part and parcel of Viñëu, whereas Durväsä and Soma were parts and parcels of Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä."
