Sati was the daughter of a great king, Dakña, and because his youngest daughter, Sati, selected as her husband Lord Çiva, King Dakña was not very much satisfied with her. Therefore whenever she met her father, he unnecessarily criticized her husband, although Lord Çiva was faultless. Because of this, before attaining a mature age Sati gave up the body given by her father, Dakña, and therefore she could not produce a child."
