Atri Åñi offered his respect to the three deities in that way. They were identified by their different carriers and different symbolic representations. In that connection it is stated here that Lord Viñëu was sitting on Garuòa, a big aquiline bird, and was carrying in His hand a disc, Brahmä was sitting on a swan and had in his hand kuça grass, and Lord Çiva was sitting on a bull and carrying in his hand a small drum called a òamaru. Atri Åñi recognized them by their symbolic representations and different carriers, and thus he offered them prayers and respects."
