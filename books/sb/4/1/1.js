By his grace we have finished three cantos already, and we are just trying to begin the Fourth Canto. By his divine grace let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Lord Caitanya, who began this Kåñëa consciousness movement of Bhägavata-dharma five hundred years ago, and through His grace let us offer our obeisances to the six Gosvämés, and then let us offer our obeisances to Rädhä and Kåñëa, the spiritual couple who enjoy eternally in Våndävana with Their cowherd boys and damsels in Vrajabhümi. Let us also offer our respectful obeisances to all the devotees and eternal servitors of the Supreme Lord."

            "content": "In this Fourth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam there are thirty-one chapters, and all these chapters describe the secondary creation by Brahmä and the Manus. The Supreme Lord Himself does the real creation by agitating His material energy, and then, by His order, Brahma, the first living creature in the universe, attempts to create the different planetary systems and their inhabitants, expanding the population through his progeny, like Manu and other progenitors of living entities, who work perpetually under the order of the Supreme Lord. In the First Chapter of this Fourth Canto there are descriptions of the three daughters of Sväyambhuva Manu and their descendants. The next six chapters describe the sacrifice performed by King Dakña and how it was spoiled. Thereafter the activities of Mahäräja Dhruva are described in five chapters. Then, in eleven chapters, the activities of King Påthu are described, and the next eight chapters are devoted to the activities of the Pracetä kings."

            "content": "As described in the first verse of this chapter, Sväyambhuva Manu had three daughters, named Äküti, Devahüti and Prasüti. Of these three daughters, one daughter, Devahüti, has already been described, along with her husband, Kardama Muni, and her son, Kapila Muni. In this chapter the descendants of the first daughter, Äküti, will specifically be described. Sväyambhuva Manu was the son of Brahmä. Brahmä had many other sons, but Manu's name is specifically mentioned first because he was a great devotee of the Lord. In this verse there is also the word ca, indicating that besides the three daughters mentioned, Sväyambhuva Manu also had two sons."
