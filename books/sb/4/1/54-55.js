    "translation": "In the heavenly planets, bands began to play, and they showered flowers from the sky. The pacified sages chanted Vedic prayers, the denizens of heaven known as the Gandharvas and Kinnaras sang, the beautiful damsels of the heavenly planets danced, and in this way, at the time of the appearance of Nara-Näräyaëa, all signs of good fortune were visible. Just at that time, great demigods like Brahmä also offered their respectful prayers.",
