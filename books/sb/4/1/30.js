Mahä-Viñëu, from whose breathing millions of universes emanate and into whom they are again withdrawn, may be accepted as the Lord of the universe. Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, from whose abdomen sprouted the lotus flower which is the birthplace of Brahmä, may also be considered the Lord of the universe. Similarly, Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, who is the Supersoul of all living entities, may also be considered the Lord of the universe. Then, under the order of Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, the Viñëu form within this universe, Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva may also be accepted as the Lords of the universe."

            "content": "Viñëu is the Lord of the universe because He is its maintainer. Similarly, Brahmä creates the different planetary systems and the population, so he also may be considered the Lord of the universe. Or Lord Çiva, who is ultimately the destroyer of the universe, also may be considered its Lord. Therefore, since Atri Muni did not specifically mention whom he wanted, all three—Brahmä, Viñëu and Lord Çiva—came before him. They said, \"Since you were thinking of having a son exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord of the universe, your determination will be fulfilled.\" In other words, one's determination is fulfilled according to the strength of one's devotion. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä : yänti deva-vratä devän pitṟn yänti pitå-vratäù. If one is attached to a particular demigod, one is promoted to the abode of that demigod; if one is attached to the Pitäs, or forefathers, one is promoted to their planet; and similarly if one is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, one is promoted to the abode of Lord Kåñëa. Atri Muni had no clear conception of the Lord of the universe; therefore the three presiding deities who are actually the lords of the universe in the three departments of the modes of nature all came before him. Now, according to the strength of his determination for a son, his desire would be fulfilled by the grace of the Lord."
