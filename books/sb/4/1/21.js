That fire was perceived by the Supersoul, Viñëu, and thereby Lord Brahmä and Çiva also perceived it. Atri Muni, by his breathing exercise, concentrated on the Supersoul, or the Lord of the universe. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord of the universe is Väsudeva (väsudevaù sarvam iti ), and, by the direction of Väsudeva, Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva work. Therefore, on the direction of Väsudeva, both Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva perceived the severe penance adopted by Atri Muni, and thus they were pleased to come down, as stated in the next verse."
