The first item mentioned is dayayä sarva-bhüteñu, showing mercy to all conditioned souls. The best way to show mercy is to spread Kåñëa consciousness. The entire world is suffering for want of this knowledge. People should know that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original cause of everything. Knowing this, everyone should directly engage in His devotional service. Those who are actually learned, advanced in spiritual understanding, should preach Kåñëa consciousness all over the world so that people may take to it and make their lives successful."

Everyone can benefit spiritually by the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. When the transcendental vibration of Hare Kåñëa is sounded, even the trees, animals and insects benefit. Thus when one chants the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra loudly, he actually shows mercy to all living entities. To spread the Kåñëa consciousness movement throughout the world, the devotees should be satisfied in all conditions."

Even while preaching in hell, a pure devotee remains a pure devotee by his constant association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To attain this state, one has to control his senses. The senses are automatically controlled when one's mind is engaged in the service of the Lord."
