    "translation": "Transcendental practices that do not ultimately help one realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead are useless, be they mystic yoga practices, the analytical study of matter, severe austerity, the acceptance of sannyäsa, or the study of Vedic literature. All these may be very important aspects of spiritual advancement, but unless one understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, all these processes are useless.",

            "content": "Impersonalists do not take to devotional service, but take to other practices, such as the analytical study of the material elements, the discrimination between matter and spirit, and the mystic yoga system. These are beneficial only insofar as they are complementary to devotional service. Caitanya Mahäprabhu therefore told Sanätana Gosvämé that without a touch of devotional service, jïäna, yoga and Säìkhya philosophy cannot give one the desired results. The impersonalists wish to merge into the Supreme Brahman; however, merging into the Supreme Brahman also requires a touch of devotional service. The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases—impersonal Brahman, Paramätmä and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All these require a touch of devotional service. Sometimes it is actually seen that these Mäyävädés also chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, although their motive is to merge into the Brahman effulgence of the Absolute. The yogés also at times take to chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, but their purpose is different from that of the bhaktas. In all processes—karma, jïäna or yoga—bhakti is required. That is the purport of this verse."
