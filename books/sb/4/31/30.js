Vidura belonged to the royal family of the Kauravas, and although he knew that all the family members were destroyed at the Battle of Kurukñetra, he nonetheless wanted to see his elder brother, Dhåtaräñöra, to see if he could deliver Dhåtaräñöra from the clutches of mäyä. When a great saintly person like Vidura sees his relatives, he desires only to deliver them from the clutches of mäyä. Vidura thus offered his respectful obeisances to his spiritual master and departed for the city of Hastinäpura, the kingdom of the Kauravas."
