    "translation": "After practicing the yogäsana for mystic yoga, the Pracetäs managed to control their life air, mind, words and external vision. Thus by the präëäyäma process they were completely relieved of material attachment. By remaining perpendicular, they could concentrate their minds on the uppermost Brahman. While they were practicing this präëäyäma, the great sage Närada, who is worshiped both by demons and by demigods, came to see them.",

The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases—impersonal effulgence (Brahman), localized Paramätmä and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän. In his prayers, Lord Çiva concentrated upon the personal features of Parabrahman, described in personal terms as snigdha-prävåò-ghana-çyämam . Following the instructions of Lord Çiva, the Pracetäs also concentrated their minds on the Çyämasundara form of the Supreme Brahman. Although impersonal Brahman, Paramätmä Brahman and Brahman as the Supreme Person are all on the same transcendental platform, the personal feature of the Supreme Brahman is the ultimate goal and last word in transcendence."

            "content": "The great sage Närada travels everywhere. He goes to the demons and the demigods and is equally respected. He is consequently described herein as suräsureòya, worshiped both by demons and by demigods. For Närada Muni, the door of every house is open. Although there is perpetual animosity between the demons and demigods, Närada Muni is welcomed everywhere. Närada is considered one of the demigods, of course, and the word devarñi means \"the saintly person among the demigods.\" But not even the demons envy Närada Muni; therefore he is equally worshiped both by demons and by demigods. A perfect Vaiñëava's position should be just like Närada Muni's, completely independent and unbiased."
