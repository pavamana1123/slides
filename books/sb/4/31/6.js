One should know that sense enjoyment is not required, but one has to accept sense enjoyment inasmuch as one has to live. As confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam : kämasya nendriya-prétiù. One has to become a gosvämé and control his senses. One should not simply use his senses for sense gratification; rather, the senses should be employed just as much as required for maintaining body and soul together. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé recommends: anäsaktasya viñayän yathärham upayuïjataù. One should not be attached to sense objects, but should accept sense enjoyment as much as required, no more. If one wishes to enjoy the senses more than required, he becomes attached to family life, which means bondage. All the Pracetäs admitted their fault in remaining in household life."
