            "content": "In this verse bhagavän näradaù indicates that Närada is always absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhagavaty uttama-çloka äviñöätmä. Närada has no other business than thinking of Kåñëa, talking of Kåñëa and preaching about Kåñëa; therefore he is sometimes called bhagavän. Bhagavän means \"one who possesses all opulences.\" When a person possesses Bhagavän within his heart, he is also sometimes called bhagavän. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura said, säkñäd-dharitvena samasta-çästraiù: in every çästra the spiritual master is accepted directly as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This does not mean that the spiritual master or a saintly person like Närada has actually become the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but he is accepted in this way because he possesses the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart constantly. As described here (äviñöätmä), when one is simply absorbed in the thought of Kåñëa, one is also called bhagavän. Bhagavän possesses all opulence. If one possesses Bhagavän within his heart always, does he not automatically possess all opulence also? In that sense a great devotee like Närada can be called bhagavän. However, we cannot tolerate when a rascal or imposter is called bhagavän. One must possess either all opulences or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän, who possesses all opulences."
