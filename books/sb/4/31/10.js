    "translation": "A civilized human being has three kinds of births. The first birth is by a pure father and mother, and this birth is called birth by semen. The next birth takes place when one is initiated by the spiritual master, and this birth is called sävitra. The third birth, called yäjïika, takes place when one is given the opportunity to worship Lord Viñëu. Despite the opportunities for attaining such births, even if one gets the life-span of a demigod, if one does not actually engage in the service of the Lord, everything is useless. Similarly, one's activities may be mundane or spiritual, but they are useless if they are not meant for satisfying the Lord.",

            "content": "The word çaukra janma means \"taking birth by seminal discharge.\" Animals can take their birth in this way too. However, a human being can be reformed from the çaukra janma, as recommended in the Vedic civilization. Before the birth takes place, or before father and mother unite, there is a ceremony called garbhädhäna-saàskära, which must be adopted. This garbhädhäna-saàskära is especially recommended for higher castes, especially the brähmaëa caste. It is said in the çästras that if the garbhädhäna-saàskära is not practiced among the higher castes, the entire family becomes çüdra. It is also stated that in this age of Kali, everyone is çüdra due to the absence of the garbhädhäna-saàskära. This is the Vedic system. According to the päïcarätrika system, however, even though everyone is a çüdra due to the absence of the garbhädhäna-saàskära, if a person has but a little tendency to become Kåñëa conscious, he should be given the chance to elevate himself to the transcendental platform of devotional service. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement adopts this päïcarätrika-vidhi, as advised by Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, who says:"

In our Kåñëa consciousness movement, we therefore offer the student his first initiation and allow him to chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. By chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra regularly and following the regulative principles, one becomes qualified to be initiated as a brähmaëa, because unless one is a qualified brähmaëa he cannot be allowed to worship Lord Viñëu. This is called yäjïika janma. In our Kåñëa consciousness society, unless one is twice initiated—first by chanting Hare Kåñëa and second by the Gäyatré mantra—he is not allowed to enter the kitchen or Deity room to execute duties. However, when one is elevated to the platform on which he can worship the Deity, his previous birth does not matter."

Indeed, such a caëòäla can deliver not only himself but all his family predecessors. Without devotional service, even a proud brähmaëa cannot deliver himself, and what to speak of his family. In many instances in the çästras it is seen that even a brähmaëa has become a kñatriya, vaiçya, çüdra, mleccha or non-brähmaëa. And there are many instances of one's being born a kñatriya or vaiçya or even lower and, in the eighteenth year, attaining elevation to the brahminical platform by the process of initiation. Therefore Närada Muni says:"
