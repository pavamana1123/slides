            "content": "The Vedic ritualistic ceremonies are certainly meant to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viñëu. However, by such activities one does not factually satisfy the Lord. Rather, with the sanction of the Lord, one tries to satisfy one's own senses. In other words, materialists, who are especially interested in sense gratification, are given permission or license to enjoy sense gratification by executing the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. That is called traiguëya-viñayä vedäù. The Vedic performances are based on the three modes of material nature. Those who are elevated above the material condition are not at all interested in such Vedic performances. Rather, they are interested in the higher duties of transcendental loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such devotional service is called nistraiguëya. Devotional service to the Lord has nothing to do with the material conception of bodily comfort."
