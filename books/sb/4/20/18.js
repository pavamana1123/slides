    "translation": "As King Indra was standing by, he became ashamed of his own activities and fell down before King Påthu to touch his lotus feet.

            "content": "There are many cases in which a person becomes an offender to the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava and later becomes repentant. Here also we find that although the King of heaven, Indra, was so powerful that he accompanied Lord Viñëu, he felt himself a great offender for stealing Påthu Mahäräja's horse that was meant for sacrifice. An offender at the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava is never excused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many instances illustrating this fact. Ambaréña Mahäräja was offended by Durväsä Muni, a great sage and mystic yogé, and Durväsä also had to fall down at the lotus feet of Ambaréña Mahäräja. Indra decided to fall down at the lotus feet of King Påthu, but the King was so magnanimous a Vaiñëava that he did not want Mahäräja Indra to fall down at his feet. Instead, King Påthu immediately picked him up and embraced him, and both of them forgot all the past incidents. Both King Indra and Mahäräja Påthu were envious and angry with each other, but since both of them were Vaiñëavas, or servants of Lord Viñëu, it was their duty to adjust the cause of their envy. This is also a first-class example of cooperative behavior between Vaiñëavas. In the present days, however, because people are not Vaiñëavas, they fight perpetually among one another and are vanquished without finishing the mission of human life. There is a great need to propagate the Kåñëa consciousness movement in the world so that even though people sometimes become angry and malicious toward one another, because of their being Kåñëa conscious such rivalry, competition and envy can be adjusted without difficulty."
