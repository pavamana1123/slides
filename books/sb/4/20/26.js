    "translation": "My dear highly glorified Lord, if one, in the association of pure devotees, hears even once the glories of Your activities, he does not, unless he is nothing but an animal, give up the association of devotees, for no intelligent person would be so careless as to leave their association. The perfection of chanting and hearing about Your glories was accepted even by the goddess of fortune, who desired to hear of Your unlimited activities and transcendental glories.",

            "content": "The association of devotees (ärya-saìgama) is the most important factor in this world. The word ärya refers to those who are advancing spiritually. In the history of the human race, the Äryan family is considered to be the most elevated community in the world because it adopts the Vedic civilization. The Äryan family is distributed all over the world and is known as Indo-Äryan. In prehistoric days all of the members of the Äryan family followed the Vedic principles, and therefore they became spiritually advanced. The kings, known as räjarñis, were so perfectly educated as kñatriyas, or protectors of the citizens, and so greatly advanced in spiritual life, that there was not a bit of trouble for the citizens."

            "content": "The glorification of the Supreme Lord can be very much appreciated by the Äryan family. Although there is no bar for others, the members of the Äryan family very quickly catch the essence of spiritual life. How is it that we are finding it very easy to spread Kåñëa consciousness among the Europeans and Americans? History reports that the Americans and Europeans proved their capability when they were anxious to expand colonization, but at the present time, being contaminated by the advancement of material science, their sons and grandsons are turning into reprobates. This is due to their having lost their original spiritual culture, which is Vedic civilization. Presently these descendants of the Äryan family are taking this Kåñëa consciousness movement very seriously. Others who are associating with them and hearing the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra from the lips of pure devotees are also becoming captivated by the transcendental vibration. Transcendental vibrations are very much effective when chanted among Äryans, but even though one does not belong to the Äryan family, he will become a Vaiñëava simply by hearing the mantra because the vibration has great influence over everyone."

            "content": "Mahäräja Påthu points out that even the goddess of fortune, who is the constant companion of Lord Näräyaëa, specifically wanted to hear about the Lord's glories, and for the association of the gopés, who are pure devotees, the goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, underwent severe austerities. The impersonalist may ask why one should bother chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra continually for so many years instead of stopping and trying for kaivalya, liberation, or merging into the existence of the Lord. In answer, Mahäräja Påthu maintains that the attraction of this chanting is so great that one cannot give up the process unless he is an animal. This is the case even if one comes in contact with this transcendental vibration by chance. Påthu Mahäräja is very emphatic in this connection—only an animal can give up the practice of chanting Hare Kåñëa. Those who are not animals but actually intelligent, advanced, human, civilized men cannot give up this practice of continually chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare."
