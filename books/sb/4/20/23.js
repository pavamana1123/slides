    "translation": "My dear Lord, You are the best of the demigods who can offer benedictions. Why, therefore, should any learned person ask You for benedictions meant for living entities bewildered by the modes of nature? Such benedictions are available automatically, even in the lives of living entities suffering in hellish conditions. My dear Lord, You can certainly bestow merging into Your existence, but I do not wish to have such a benediction.",

            "content": "There are different kinds of benedictions according to a person's demands. For karmés the best benediction is promotion to the higher planetary systems, where the duration of life is very long and the standard of living and happiness is very high. There are others, namely jïänés and yogés, who want the benediction of merging into the existence of the Lord. This is called kaivalya. The Lord is therefore addressed as kaivalya-pati, the master or Lord of the benediction known as kaivalya. But devotees receive a different type of benediction from the Lord. Devotees are anxious neither for the heavenly planets nor for merging into the existence of the Lord. According to devotees, kaivalya, or merging into the existence of the Lord, is considered as good as hell. The word naraka means \"hell.\" Similarly, everyone who exists in this material world is called näraka because this material existence itself is known as a hellish condition of life. Påthu Mahäräja, however, expressed that he was interested neither in the benediction desired by the karmés nor that desired by the jïänés and yogés. Çréla Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté Prabhu, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, described that kaivalya is no better than a hellish condition of life, and as for the delights of the heavenly planets, they are factually will-o'-the-wisps, or phantasmagoria. They are not wanted by devotees. Devotees do not even care for the positions held by Lord Brahmä or Lord Çiva, nor does a devotee desire to become equal with Lord Viñëu. As a pure devotee of the Lord, Påthu Mahäräja made his position very clear."
