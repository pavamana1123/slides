            "content": "In this verse the word våddha-sevayä is very significant. Våddha means \"old.\" Sevayä means \"by service.\" Perfect knowledge is acquired from the äcäryas, or liberated souls. No one can be perfect in knowledge without being trained by the paramparä system. Påthu Mahäräja was completely trained in that line; therefore he did not deserve to be considered an ordinary man. An ordinary man, who has only a conception of bodily existence, is always bewildered by the modes of material nature."
