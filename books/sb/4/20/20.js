    "translation": "The Lord was just about to leave, but because He was so greatly inclined toward the behavior of King Påthu, He did not depart. Seeing the behavior of Mahäräja Påthu with His lotus eyes, He was detained because He is always the well-wisher of His devotees.",

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always very inclined toward His devotee and is always thinking of the devotee's well-being. This is not partiality. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord is equal to everyone (samo 'haà sarva-bhüteñu ), but to one who particularly engages in His service, He is very much inclined. In another place, the Lord says that a devotee always exists in His heart, and He also exists always in the heart of the devotee."

The Lord is not far away from the devotee. He is always in everyone's heart, but only the devotee can realize the Lord's presence, and thus he is directly connected, and he takes instruction from the Lord at every moment. Therefore, there is no chance of a devotee's being in error, nor is there any partiality on the part of the Lord for His pure devotees."
