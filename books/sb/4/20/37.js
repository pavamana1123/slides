            "content": "Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is all-spiritual, He can descend from the spiritual sky without changing His body, and thus He is known as acyuta, or infallible. When a living entity falls down to the material world, however, he has to accept a material body, and therefore, in his material embodiment, he cannot be called acyuta. Because he falls down from his real engagement in the service of the Lord, the living entity gets a material body to suffer or try to enjoy in the miserable material conditions of life. Therefore the fallen living entity is cyuta, whereas the Lord is called acyuta. The Lord was attractive for everyone—not only the King but also the priestly order, who were very much addicted to the performance of Vedic rituals. Because the Lord is all-attractive, He is called Kåñëa, or \"one who attracts everyone.\" The Lord appeared in the sacrificial arena of Mahäräja Påthu as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, who is a plenary expansion of Lord Kåñëa. He is the second incarnation from Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu, who is the origin of material creation and who expands as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who then enters into each and every universe. Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu is one of the puruñas who control the material modes of nature."
