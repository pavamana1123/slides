    "translation": "King Påthu then offered his respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supreme Lord of all demigods. Although not an object of material vision, the Lord revealed Himself to the sight of Mahäräja Påthu. After offering obeisances to the Lord, the King returned to his home.",

Avyakta means \"unmanifested.\" Although the material world is the creation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is unmanifested to material eyes. Mahäräja Påthu, however, developed spiritual eyes by his pure devotional service. Here, therefore, the Lord is described as sandarçitätmä, for He reveals Himself to the vision of the devotee, although He is not visible to ordinary eyes."
