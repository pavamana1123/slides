This means that anything spoken by the Personality of Godhead should be taken as it is, with great care and attention and with great respect. It is not our business to amend the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or make additions or alterations, as it has become a custom for many so-called scholars and svämés who comment on the words of Bhagavad-gétä. Here the practical example of how to accept the instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is shown by Påthu Mahäräja. This is the way to receive knowledge through the paramparä system."
