    "translation": "The wife of Dakña prayed as follows: My dear Lord, it is very fortunate that You have appeared in this arena of sacrifice. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, and I request that You be pleased on this occasion. The sacrificial arena is not beautiful without You, just as a body is not beautiful without the head.",

Unless we please Him, whatever we do is the cause of our bondage in the material world. This is confirmed herein by the wife of Dakña: \"Without Your presence, the grandeur of this sacrificial ceremony is useless, just as a body without the head, however decorated it may be, is useless.\" The comparison is equally applicable to the social body. Material civilization is very proud of being advanced, but it is actually the useless trunk of a body without a head. Without Kåñëa consciousness, without an understanding of Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, any advancement in a civilization, no matter how sophisticated, is of no value. There is a statement in the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya (3.11):"

            "content": "The purport is that sometimes when a friend or relative dies, especially among lower class men, the dead body is decorated. Dressed and ornamented, the body is taken in procession. That sort of decoration of the dead body has no actual value because the life force is already gone. Similarly, any aristocracy, any social prestige or any advancement of material civilization without Kåñëa consciousness is as good as the decoration of a dead body. The name of the wife of Dakña was Prasüti, and she was the daughter of Sväyambhuva Manu. Her sister, Devahüti, was married to Kardama Muni, and Kapiladeva, the Personality of Godhead, became her son. Prasüti, then, was the aunt of Lord Viñëu. She was asking the favor of Lord Viñëu in an affectionate mode; since she was His aunt, she sought some special favor. Also significant in this verse is that the Lord is praised with the goddess of fortune. Wherever Lord Viñëu is worshiped, naturally there is the favor of the goddess of fortune. Lord Viñëu is addressed as amåta, transcendental. The demigods, including Brahmä and Lord Çiva, were produced after the creation, but Lord Viñëu existed before the creation. He is addressed, therefore, as amåta. Lord Viñëu is worshiped with His internal energy by the Vaiñëavas. Prasüti, the wife of Dakña, implored the Lord to turn the priests into Vaiñëavas instead of simply fruitive workers performing sacrifices for some material benefits."
