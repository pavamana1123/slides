    "translation": "The Gandharvas said: Dear Lord, all the demigods, including Lord Çiva, Lord Brahmä, Indra and Maréci and the great sages, are all only differentiated parts and parcels of Your body. You are the Supreme Almighty Great; the whole creation is just like a plaything for You. We always accept You as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we offer our respectful obeisances unto You.",

            "content": "In the Brahma-saàhitä it is said that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There may be many gods, from Brahmä, Lord Çiva, Indra and Candra down to the rulers of the lower planetary systems, the presidents, ministers, chairmen and kings. In fact, anyone can think that he is God. That is the false, puffed-up conviction of material life. Actually Viñëu is the Supreme Lord, but there is even one above Viñëu, for Viñëu is also the plenary portion of a part of Kåñëa. In this verse this is referred to by the word aàçäàçäù, which refers to part and parcel of a part and parcel. There are similar verses in the Caitanya-caritämåta which indicate that the Supreme Lord's parts and parcels again expand into other parts and parcels. As described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, there are many manifestations of Viñëu and many manifestations of living entities. Viñëu manifestations are called sväàça, partial manifestations, and the living entities are called vibhinnäàça. The demigods like Brahmä and Indra have been promoted to such exalted positions by pious activities and austerities, but actually Viñëu, or Kåñëa, is the master of everyone. In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is said, ekale éçvara kåñëa, ära saba bhåtya  is the statement of Çrémad-Bhägavatam: \"Kåñëa is the only Supreme Lord.\" Worship of Kåñëa alone, therefore, includes worship of all the parts and parcels, just as watering the root of a tree also waters all the branches, twigs, leaves and flowers."
