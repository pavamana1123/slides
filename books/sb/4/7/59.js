Sakti is feminine, and the Lord is puruña, masculine. It is the duty of the female to serve under the supreme puruña. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, all living entities are marginal energies of the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is the duty of all living entities to serve this Supreme Person. Durgä is the representation in the material world of both the marginal and external energies, and Lord Çiva is the representation of the Supreme Person. The connection of Lord Çiva and Ambikä, or Durgä, is eternal. Saté could not accept any husband but Lord Çiva. How Lord Çiva remarried Durgä as Himavaté, the daughter of the Himalayas, and how Kärttikeya was born, is a great story in itself."
