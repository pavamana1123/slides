    "translation": "Maitreya continued: My dear sinless Vidura, Lord Viñëu is actually the enjoyer of the results of all sacrifices. Yet because of His being the Supersoul of all living entities, He was satisfied simply with His share of the sacrificial offerings. He therefore addressed Dakña in a pleasing attitude.",

            "content": "In Bhagavad-gétä , patraà puñpaà phalaà toyaà yo me bhaktyä prayacchati: if any devotee offers Him even a small leaf, or a flower or water, if it is offered with love and affection, the Lord accepts it and is pleased. Although He is self-sufficient and does not need anything from anyone, He accepts such offerings because, as Supersoul, He has such a friendly attitude toward all living entities. Another point here is that He does not encroach upon another's share. In the yajïa there is a share for the demigods, Lord Çiva, and Lord Brahmä, and a share for Lord Viñëu. He is satisfied with His own share and does not encroach upon others'. Indirectly, He indicated that He was not satisfied with Dakña's trying to deny Lord Çiva his share. Maitreya addressed Vidura as sinless because Vidura was a pure Vaiñëava and never committed any offense to any demigod. Although Vaiñëavas accept Lord Viñëu as the Supreme, they are not prone to offend demigods. They give the demigods proper respect. Vaiñëavas accept Lord Çiva as the best Vaiñëava. For a Vaiñëava there is no possibility of offending any demigods, and the demigods are also pleased with the Vaiñëava because they are faultless devotees of Lord Viñëu."
