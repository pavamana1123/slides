            "content": "As usual, a devotee in an adverse condition of life accepts such a condition to be the mercy of the Lord. Factually, the insulting words used by Dakña against Lord Çiva were enough to have him thrown perpetually into a hellish life. But Lord Çiva, being kind toward him, awarded him punishment to neutralize the offense. King Dakña realized this and, feeling obliged for Lord Çiva's magnanimous behavior, wanted to show his gratitude. Sometimes a father punishes his child, and when the child is grown up and comes to his senses, he understands that the father's punishment was not actually punishment but mercy. Similarly, Dakña appreciated that the punishment offered to him by Lord Çiva was a manifestation of Lord Çiva's mercy. That is the symptom of a person making progress on the path of Kåñëa consciousness. It is said that a devotee in Kåñëa consciousness never takes any miserable condition of life to be condemnation by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He accepts the miserable condition to be the grace of the Lord. He thinks, \"I would have been punished or put into a more dangerous condition of life due to my past misdeeds, but the Lord has protected me. Thus I have received only a little punishment as token execution of the law of karma.\" Thinking of His grace in that way, a devotee always surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead more and more seriously and is not disturbed by such so-called punishment."
