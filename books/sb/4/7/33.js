    "translation": "The wives of the performers of the sacrifice said: My dear Lord, this sacrifice was arranged under the instruction of Brahmä, but unfortunately Lord Çiva, being angry at Dakña, devastated the entire scene, and because of his anger the animals meant for sacrifice are lying dead. Therefore the preparations of the yajïa have been lost. Now, by the glance of Your lotus eyes, the sanctity of this sacrificial arena may be again invoked.",

Offering an animal in sacrifice and giving him renewed life was the evidence of the strength of chanting mantras. Unfortunately, when Dakña's sacrifice was devastated by Lord Çiva, some of the animals were killed. (One was killed just to replace the head of Dakña.) Their bodies were lying about, and the sacrificial arena was turned into a crematorium. Thus the real purpose of yajïa was lost."

The purport here is that animals should not be unnecessarily killed. They were used to prove the strength of the mantras and were to have been rejuvenated by the use of the mantras. They should not have been killed, as they were by Lord Çiva to replace the head of Dakña with an animal's head. It was pleasing to see an animal sacrificed and rejuvenated, and that pleasing atmosphere had been lost. The wives of the priests requested that the animals be brought back to life by the glance of Lord Viñëu to make a pleasing yajïa."
