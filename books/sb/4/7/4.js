    "translation": "The demigod Püñä will be able to chew only through the teeth of his disciples, and if alone, he will have to satisfy himself by eating dough made from chickpea flour. But the demigods who have agreed to give me my share of the sacrifice will recover from all their injuries.",

He could not use his teeth for eating, since he had laughed at Lord Çiva, deriding him by showing his teeth. In other words, it was not appropriate for him to have teeth, for he had used them against Lord Çiva."
