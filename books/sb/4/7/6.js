He is also known as Äçutoña, which indicates that he is very quickly satisfied and very quickly angered. It is said in Bhagavad-gétä that less intelligent persons go to the demigods for material benedictions. In this connection, people generally go to Lord Çiva, and because he is always quickly satisfied and gives benedictions to his devotees without consideration, he is called méòhuñöama, or the best of the benedictors. Materialistic persons are always anxious to get material profit, but they are not serious about spiritual profit."

            "content": "Sometimes, of course, it so happens that Lord Çiva becomes the best benedictor in spiritual life. It is said that once a poor brähmaëa worshiped Lord Çiva for a benediction, and Lord Çiva advised the devotee to go to see Sanätana Gosvämé. The devotee went to Sanätana Gosvämé and informed him that Lord Çiva had advised him to seek out the best benediction from him (Sanätana). Sanätana had a touchstone with him, which he kept with the garbage. On the request of the poor brähmaëa, Sanätana Gosvämé gave him the touchstone, and the brähmaëa was very happy to have it. He now could get as much gold as he desired simply by touching the touchstone to iron. But after he left Sanätana, he thought, \"If a touchstone is the best benediction, why has Sanätana Gosvämé kept it with the garbage?\" He therefore returned and asked Sanätana Gosvämé, \"Sir, if this is the best benediction, why did you keep it with the garbage?\" Sanätana Gosvämé then informed him, \"Actually, this is not the best benediction. But are you prepared to take the best benediction from me?\" The brähmaëa said, \"Yes, sir. Lord Çiva has sent me to you for the best benediction.\" Then Sanätana Gosvämé asked him to throw the touchstone in the water nearby and then come back. The poor brähmaëa did so, and when he returned, Sanätana Gosvämé initiated him with the Hare Kåñëa mantra. Thus by the benediction of Lord Çiva the brähmaëa got the association of the best devotee of Lord Kåñëa and was thus initiated in the mahä-mantra, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare."
