The Supreme Lord, being the Supersoul in every living entity, including Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, is directing everyone in the activities of the material modes of nature. No one can act independently of the sanction of the Lord, and therefore, indirectly, no one is different from the Supreme Person—certainly not Brahmä and Rudra, who are incarnations of the material nature's modes of passion and ignorance."
