Similarly, a devotee's oneness is manifested in His compassion for all conditioned souls. Bhagavad-gétä  says, paëòitäù sama-darçinaù: those who are learned see everyone's conditional life equally. Devotees are compassionate to every conditioned soul, and therefore they are known as apärakya-buddhi. Because devotees are learned and know that every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, they preach Kåñëa consciousness to everyone so that everyone may be happy. If a particular part of the body is diseased, the whole attention of the body goes to that part. Similarly, devotees care for any person who is forgetful of Kåñëa and therefore in material consciousness. The equal vision of the devotee is that he works to get all living entities back home, back to Godhead."
