    "translation": "King Dakña said: My dear Lord Çiva, I committed a great offense against you, but you are so kind that instead of withdrawing your mercy, you have done me a great favor by punishing me. You and Lord Viñëu never neglect even useless, unqualified brähmaëas. Why, then, should you neglect me, who am engaged in performing sacrifices?",

            "content": "Although Dakña felt defeated, he knew that his punishment was simply the great mercy of Lord Çiva. He remembered that Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu are never neglectful of the brähmaëas, even though the brähmaëas are sometimes unqualified. According to Vedic civilization, a descendant of a brähmaëa family should never be heavily punished. This was exemplified in Arjuna's treatment of Açvatthämä. Açvatthämä was the son of a great brähmaëa, Droëäcärya, and in spite of his having committed the great offense of killing all the sleeping sons of the Päëòavas, for which he was condemned even by Lord Kåñëa, Arjuna excused him by not killing him because he happened to be the son of a brähmaëa. The word brahma-bandhuñu used here is significant. Brahma-bandhu means a person who is born of a brähmaëa father but whose activities are not up to the standard of the brähmaëas. Such a person is not a brähmaëa but a brahma-bandhu. Dakña proved himself to be a brahma-bandhu. He was born of a great brähmaëa father, Lord Brahmä, but his treatment of Lord Çiva was not exactly brahminical; therefore he admitted that he was not a perfect brähmaëa. Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu, however, are affectionate even to an imperfect brähmaëa. Lord Çiva punished Dakña not as one does his enemy; rather, he punished Dakña just to bring him to his senses, so that he would know that he had done wrong. Dakña could understand this, and he acknowledged the great mercy of Lord Kåñëa and Lord Çiva towards the fallen brähmaëas, including even himself. Although he was fallen, his vow was to execute the sacrifice, as is the duty of brähmaëas, and thus he began his prayers to Lord Çiva."
