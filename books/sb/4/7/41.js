    "translation": "The fire-god said: My dear Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You because by Your favor I am as luminous as blazing fire and I accept the offerings mixed with butter and offered in sacrifice. The five kinds of offerings according to the Yajur Veda are all Your different energies, and You are worshiped by five kinds of Vedic hymns. Sacrifice means Your Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

            "content": "In Bhagavad-gétä it is clearly said that yajïa should be performed for Lord Viñëu. Lord Viñëu has one thousand popular, transcendental names, out of which one name is Yajïa. It is clearly said that everything should be done for the satisfaction of Yajïa, or Viñëu. All other actions a person may take are only causes for his bondage. Everyone has to perform yajïa according to the Vedic hymns. As stated in the Upaniñads, fire, the altar, the auspicious full moon, the period of four months called cäturmäsya, the sacrificial animal, and the beverage called soma are necessary requisites, as are the specific hymns mentioned in the Vedas and composed of four letters. One hymn is as follows: äçrävayeti catur-akñaraà astu çrauñaò iti catur-akñaraà yajeti dväbhyäà ye yajämahaù. These mantras, chanted according to the çruti and småti literatures, are only to please Lord Viñëu. For the deliverance of those who are materially conditioned and attached to material enjoyment, performing yajïa and following the rules and regulations of the four divisions of society and of spiritual life are recommended. It is said in the Viñëu Puräëa that by offering sacrifice to Viñëu one can gradually be liberated. The whole target of life, therefore, is to please Lord Viñëu. That is yajïa. Any person who is in Kåñëa consciousness has dedicated his life for the satisfaction of Kåñëa, the origin of all Viñëu forms, and by offering worship and prasäda daily, he becomes the best performer of yajïa. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is clearly stated that in this age of Kali the only successful performance of yajïa, or sacrifice, is yajïaiù saìkértana-präyaiù: the best type of sacrifice is simply to chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. This yajïa is offered before the form of Lord Caitanya, as other yajïas are offered before the form of Lord Viñëu. These recommendations are found in the Eleventh Canto of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Moreover, this yajïa performance confirms that Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu is Viñëu Himself. As Lord Viñëu appeared at the Dakña yajïa long, long ago, Lord Caitanya has appeared in this age to accept our saìkértana-yajïa."
