There is a gulf of difference between these two kinds of punishment. Lord Çiva is by nature a Vaiñëava, a great devotee, and his name in this connection is Äçutoña. He is always satisfied, and therefore he did not become angry as if he were an enemy. He is not inimical to any living entity; rather, he always wishes the welfare of all. Whenever he chastises a person, it is just like a father's punishment of his son. Lord Çiva is like a father because he never takes seriously any offense by any living entities, especially the demigods."
