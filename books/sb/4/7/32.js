            "content": "It is generally understood from revealed scriptures that Lord Viñëu appears with four hands, but in this particular sacrificial arena Lord Viñëu arrived with eight hands. King Indra said, \"Even though we are accustomed to see Your four-handed Viñëu form, this appearance with eight hands is as real as the four-handed form.\" As Lord Brahmä had said, to realize the transcendental form of the Lord is beyond the power of the senses. In reply to that statement by Brahmä, King Indra said that even though the transcendental form of the Lord is not perceivable by the material senses, His activities and His transcendental form can be understood. The Lord's uncommon features, uncommon activities and uncommon beauty can be perceived even by an ordinary man. For example, when Lord Kåñëa appeared just like a six- or seven-year-old boy in Våndävana, He was approached by the residents there. There were torrents of rain, and the Lord saved the residents of Våndävana by lifting Govardhana Hill and resting it on the little finger of His left hand for seven days. This uncommon feature of the Lord should convince even materialistic persons who want to speculate to the limit of their material senses. The activities of the Lord are pleasing to experimental vision also, but impersonalists will not believe in His identity because they study the personality of the Lord by comparing their personality to His. Because men in this material world cannot lift a hill, they do not believe that the Lord can lift one. They accept the statements of Çrémad-Bhägavatam to be allegorical, and they try to interpret them in their own way. But factually the Lord lifted the hill in the presence of all the inhabitants of Våndävana, as corroborated by great äcäryas and authors like Vyäsadeva and Närada. Everything about the Lord—His activities, pastimes and uncommon features—should be accepted as is, and in this way, even in our present condition, we can understand the Lord. In the instance herein, King Indra confirmed: \"Your presence with eight hands is as good as Your presence with four hands.\" There is no doubt about it."
