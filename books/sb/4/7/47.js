    "translation": "Dear Lord, we were awaiting Your audience because we have been unable to perform the yajïas according to the Vedic rituals. We pray unto You, therefore, to be pleased with us. Simply by chanting Your holy name, one can surpass all obstacles. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You in Your presence.",

            "content": "The brähmaëa priests were very hopeful that their sacrifice would be carried out without obstacles now that Lord Viñëu was present. It is significant in this verse that the brähmaëas say, \"Simply by chanting Your holy name we can surpass the obstacles, but now You are personally present.\" The performance of yajïa by Dakña was obstructed by the disciples and followers of Lord Çiva. The brähmaëas indirectly criticized the followers of Lord Çiva, but because the brähmaëas were always protected by Lord Viñëu, Çiva's followers could not do any harm to their prosecution of the sacrificial process. There is a saying that when Kåñëa protects someone, no one can do him harm, and when Kåñëa wants to kill someone, no one can protect him. The vivid example was Rävaëa. Rävaëa was a great devotee of Lord Çiva, but when Lord Rämacandra wanted to kill him, Lord Çiva could not protect him. If some demigod, even Lord Çiva or Lord Brahmä, wants to do harm to a devotee, Kåñëa protects the devotee. But when Kåñëa wants to kill someone, such as Rävaëa or Hiraëyakaçipu, no demigod can protect him."
