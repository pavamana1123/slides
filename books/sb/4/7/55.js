            "content": "Lord Viñëu should be offered everything, and His prasäda should be distributed to all the demigods. This practice is still followed in the temple of Jagannätha at Puré. There are many temples of demigods around the main temple of Jagannätha, and the prasäda which is offered first to Jagannätha is distributed to all the demigods. The deity of Bhagälin is worshiped with the prasäda of Viñëu, and also, in the famous Lord Çiva temple of Bhuvaneçvara, the prasäda of Lord Viñëu or Lord Jagannätha is offered to the deity of Lord Çiva. This is the Vaiñëava principle. The Vaiñëava does not deride even ordinary living entities, including the small ant; everyone is offered proper respect according to his position. The offering, however, is in relation to the center, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, or Viñëu. The devotee who is highly elevated sees the relationship to Kåñëa in everything; he does not see anything as being independent of Kåñëa. That is his vision of oneness."
