    "translation": "My dear great and powerful Lord Çiva, you were created first from the mouth of Lord Brahmä in order to protect the brähmaëas in pursuing education, austerities, vows and self-realization. As protector of the brähmaëas, you always protect the regulative principles they follow, just as a cowherd boy keeps a stick in his hand to give protection to the cows.",

            "content": "The specific function of a human being in society, irrespective of his social status, is to practice control of the mind and senses by observing the regulative principles enjoined in the Vedic çästras. Lord Çiva is called paçupati because he protects the living entities in their developed consciousness so that they may follow the Vedic system of varëa and äçrama. The word paçu refers to the animal as well as to the human entity. It is stated here that Lord Çiva is always interested in protecting the animals and the animalistic living entities, who are not very advanced in the spiritual sense. It is also stated that the brähmaëas are produced from the mouth of the Supreme Lord. We should always remember that Lord Çiva is being addressed as the representative of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu. In the Vedic literature it is described that the brähmaëas are born from the mouth of the universal form of Viñëu, the kñatriyas are born from His arms, the vaiçyas from His abdomen or waist, and the çüdras from His legs. In the formation of a body, the head is the principal factor. The brähmaëas are born from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in order to accept charity for worship of Viñëu and to spread Vedic knowledge. Lord Çiva is known as paçupati, the protector of the brähmaëas and other living entities. He protects them from the attacks of non-brähmaëas, or uncultured persons who are against the self-realization process."

            "content": "Another feature of this word is that persons who are simply attached to the ritualistic portion of the Vedas and do not understand the situation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are not any more advanced than animals. In the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is confirmed that even though one performs the rituals of the Vedas, if he does not develop a sense of Kåñëa consciousness, then all his labor in performing Vedic rituals is considered to be simply a waste of time. Lord Çiva's aim in destroying the Dakña yajïa was to punish Dakña because by neglecting him (Lord Çiva), Dakña was committing a great offense. Lord Çiva's punishment was just like that of a cowherd boy, who keeps a stick to frighten his animals. It is commonly said that to give protection to animals, a stick is needed because animals cannot reason and argue. Their reasoning and argument is argumentum ad baculum; unless there is a rod, they do not obey. Force is required for the animalistic class of men, whereas those who are advanced are convinced by reasons, arguments and scriptural authority. Persons who are simply attached to Vedic rituals, without further advancement of devotional service, or Kåñëa consciousness, are almost like animals, and Lord Çiva is in charge of giving them protection and sometimes punishing them, as he punished Dakña."
