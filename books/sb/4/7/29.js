    "translation": "Lord Çiva said: My dear Lord, my mind and consciousness are always fixed on Your lotus feet, which, as the source of all benediction and the fulfillment of all desires, are worshiped by all liberated great sages because Your lotus feet are worthy of worship. With my mind fixed on Your lotus feet, I am no longer disturbed by persons who blaspheme me, claiming that my activities are not purified. I do not mind their accusations, and I excuse them out of compassion, just as You exhibit compassion toward all living entities.",

            "content": "Lord Çiva expresses herein his regret at having been angry and having disturbed the sacrificial activities of Dakña. King Dakña had insulted him in many ways, and thus he had become angry and had frustrated the entire sacrificial ceremony. Later, when he was pleased, the yajïa performances were reinstituted, and therefore he regretted his activities. Now he says that because his mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, he is no longer disturbed by the ordinary critics of his way of life. From this statement by Lord Çiva it is understood that as long as one is on the material platform one is affected by the three modes of material nature. As soon as one is in Kåñëa consciousness, however, one is no longer affected by such material activities. One should therefore always be fixed in Kåñëa consciousness, busy in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. It is guaranteed that such a devotee will never be affected by the actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature. This fact is also corroborated in Bhagavad-gétä: anyone who is fixed in the transcendental service of the Lord has surpassed all the material qualities and is situated in the status of Brahman realization, in which one is not afflicted by hankering for material objects. The recommendation of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam is that one should always be Kåñëa conscious and should never forget his transcendental relationship with the Lord. This program has to be followed strictly by everyone. From the statement of Lord Çiva it is understood that he was always in Kåñëa consciousness, and thus he remained free from material affliction. The only remedy, therefore, is to continue Kåñëa consciousness rigidly, in order to get out of the contamination of the material modes."
