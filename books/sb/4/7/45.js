    "translation": "The brähmaëas said: Dear Lord, You are sacrifice personified. You are the offering of clarified butter, You are the fire, You are the chanting of Vedic hymns by which the sacrifice is conducted, You are the fuel, You are the flame, You are the kuça grass, and You are the sacrificial pots. You are the priests who perform the yajïa, You are the demigods headed by Indra, and You are the sacrificial animal. Everything that is sacrificed is You or Your energy.",

            "content": "In this statement Lord Viñëu's all-pervasiveness is partially explained. It is said in the Viñëu Puräëa that as a fire situated in one place emanates its heat and illumination everywhere, so whatever we see within the material or spiritual worlds is nothing but a manifestation of different energies emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The brähmaëas' statement is that Lord Viñëu is everything—the fire, the offering, the clarified butter, the utensils, the place of sacrifice and the kuça. He is everything. It is confirmed herein that the performance of saìkértana-yajïa in this age is as good as all other yajïas in all other ages. If one performs saìkértana-yajïa by chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, there is no need to arrange elaborate paraphernalia for the prescribed sacrificial ceremonies recommended in the Vedas. In the chant of the holy names, Hare and Kåñëa, Hare means the energy of Kåñëa, and Kåñëa is the viñëu-tattva. Combined together they are everything. In this age, persons are harassed by the influence of Kali-yuga and cannot arrange for all the requisite paraphernalia for performing sacrifice as recommended in the Vedas. But if one simply chants Hare Kåñëa, it is to be understood that he is performing all kinds of yajïa because there is nothing within our vision except Hare (the energy of Kåñëa) and Kåñëa. There is no difference between Kåñëa and His energies. Thus since everything is a manifestation of His energy, it is to be understood that everything is Kåñëa. One simply has to accept everything in Kåñëa consciousness, and he is a liberated person. One should not misunderstand that because everything is Kåñëa, Kåñëa has no personal identity. Kåñëa is so full that in spite of keeping Himself separate from everything by His energy, He is everything. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä, Ninth Chapter. He is spread throughout the creation as everything, but still He is not everything. The philosophy recommended by Lord Caitanya is that He is simultaneously one and different."
