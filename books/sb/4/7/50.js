In the Vedas also it is stated that in the beginning there was only Viñëu, Näräyaëa; there was no Brahmä or Çiva. Similarly, Çaìkaräcärya confirmed this: näräyaëaù paraù. Näräyaëa, or Lord Viñëu, is the origin, and Brahmä and Çiva are manifested after creation. Lord Viñëu is also ätmeçvara, the Supersoul in everyone. Under His direction, everything is prompted from within. For example, in the beginning of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated, tene brahma hådä: He first educated Lord Brahmä from within."

Everything is generated from Lord Viñëu, everything is maintained by Him, and everything is annihilated by His energy. Therefore, by their actions and reactions, the energies which come from Him create the cosmic manifestations and also dissolve the whole creation. Thus the Lord is the cause and also the effect. Whatever effect we see is the interaction of His energy, and because the energy is generated from Him, He is both cause and effect. Simultaneously, everything is different and the same. It is said that everything is Brahman: sarvaà khalv idaà brahma. In the highest vision, nothing is beyond Brahman, and therefore Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva are certainly nondifferent from Him."
