            "content": "The previous chapter has already explained that Vidura questioned the sage Maitreya as to the cause of the misunderstanding between Lord Çiva and Dakña. Another question is why the strife between Dakña and his son-in-law caused Sati to destroy her body. The chief reason for Saté's giving up her body was that her father, Dakña, began another sacrificial performance, to which Lord Çiva was not invited at all. Generally, when any sacrifice is performed, although each and every sacrifice is intended to pacify the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, all the demigods, especially Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva and the other principal demigods, such as Indra and Candra, are invited, and they take part. It is said that unless all the demigods are present, no sacrifice is complete. But in the tension between the father-in-law and son-in-law, Dakña began another yajïa performance, to which Lord Çiva was not invited. Dakña was the chief progenitor employed by Lord Brahmä, and he was a son of Brahmä, so he had a high position and was also very proud."
