Since Sati was the daughter of Dakña, however cruel and contaminated he might be, naturally it was expected that he would receive her very nicely. But here it is indicated by the word anavasthita that such a person cannot be trusted. Tigers are very kind to their cubs, but it is also known that sometimes they eat them. Malicious persons should not be trusted, because they are always unsteady. Thus Saté was advised not to go to her father's house because to accept such a father as a relative and to go to his house without being properly invited was not suitable."
