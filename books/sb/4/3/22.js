    "translation": "My dear young wife, certainly friends and relatives offer mutual greetings by standing up, welcoming one another and offering obeisances. But those who are elevated to the transcendental platform, being intelligent, offer such respects to the Supersoul, who is sitting within the body, not to the person who identifies with the body.",

            "content": "It may be argued that since Dakña was the father-in-law of Lord Çiva, it was certainly the duty of Lord Çiva to offer him respect. In answer to that argument it is explained here that when a learned person stands up or offers obeisances in welcome, he offers respect to the Supersoul, who is sitting within everyone's heart. It is seen, therefore, among Vaiñëavas, that even when a disciple offers obeisances to his spiritual master, the spiritual master immediately returns the obeisances because they are mutually offered not to the body but to the Supersoul. Therefore the spiritual master also offers respect to the Supersoul situated in the body of the disciple. The Lord says in Çrémad-Bhägavatam that offering respect to His devotee is more valuable than offering respect to Him. Devotees do not identify with the body, so offering respect to a Vaiñëava means offering respect to Viñëu. It is stated also that as a matter of etiquette as soon as one sees a Vaiñëava one must immediately offer him respect, indicating the Supersoul sitting within. A Vaiñëava sees the body as a temple of Viñëu. Since Lord Çiva had already offered respect to the Supersoul in Kåñëa consciousness, offering respect to Dakña, who identified with his body, was already performed. There was no need to offer respect to his body, for that is not directed by any Vedic injunction."
