    "translation": "One who is conducted by false ego and thus always distressed, both mentally and sensually, cannot tolerate the opulence of self-realized persons. Being unable to rise to the standard of self-realization, he envies such persons as much as demons envy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

            "content": "The real reason for the enmity between Lord Çiva and Dakña is explained here. Dakña was envious of Lord Çiva because of Çiva's high position as an incarnation of a quality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and because Çiva was directly in contact with the Supersoul and was therefore honored and given a better sitting place than he. There were many other reasons also. Dakña, being materially puffed up, could not tolerate the high position of Lord Çiva, so his anger at Lord Çiva's not standing up in his presence was only the final manifestation of his envy. Lord Çiva is always in meditation and always perceives the Supersoul, as expressed here by the words püruña-buddhi-säkñiëäm. The position of one whose intelligence is always absorbed in meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very great and cannot be imitated by anyone, especially an ordinary person. When Dakña entered the arena of yajïa, Lord Çiva was in meditation and might not have seen Dakña enter, but Dakña took the opportunity to curse him because Dakña had maintained an envious attitude towards Lord Çiva for a long time. Those who are actually self-realized see every individual body as a temple of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His Paramätmä feature, is residing in everyone's body."

            "content": "When one offers respect to the body, it is not to the material body but to the presence of the Supreme Lord. Thus one who is always in meditation upon the Supreme Lord is always offering Him obeisances. But since Dakña was not very elevated, he thought that obeisances were offered to the material body, and because Lord Çiva did not offer respect to his material body, Dakña became envious. Such persons, being unable to rise to the standard of self-realized souls like Lord Çiva, are always envious. The example given here is very suitable. Asuras, demons or atheists, are always envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; they simply want to kill Him. Even in this age we find some so-called scholars commenting on Bhagavad-gétä who are envious of Kåñëa. When Kåñëa says, man-manä bhava mad-bhaktaù —\"Always think of Me, become My devotee, and surrender unto Me\"—the so-called scholars comment that it is not to Kåñëa that we have to surrender. That is envy. The asuras or atheists, the demons, without reason or cause, are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, instead of offering respect to self-realized persons, foolish men who cannot approach the highest standard of self-realization are always envious, although there is no reason."
