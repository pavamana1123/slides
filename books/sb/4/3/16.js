Lord Çiva warned that since her father was too puffed up by his material possessions, he would be angry, and this would be intolerable for her. Therefore it was better that she not go. This fact was already experienced by Lord Çiva because although Lord Çiva was faultless, Dakña had cursed him in so many harsh words."
