            "content": "In the Vedas it is prescribed that before performing a båhaspati-sava sacrifice, one should perform the sacrifice named väjapeya. While performing these sacrifices, however, Dakña neglected great devotees like Lord Çiva. According to Vedic scriptures, the demigods are eligible to participate in yajïas and share the oblations, but Dakña wanted to avoid them. All sacrifices are intended to pacify Lord Viñëu, but Lord Viñëu includes all His devotees. Brahmä, Lord Çiva and the other demigods are all obedient servants of Lord Viñëu; therefore Lord Viñëu is never satisfied without them. But Dakña, being puffed up with his power, wanted to deprive Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva of participation in the sacrifice, understanding that if one satisfies Viñëu, it is not necessary to satisfy His followers. But that is not the process. Viñëu wants His followers to be satisfied first. Lord Kåñëa says, mad-bhakta-püjäbhyadhikä:  \"The worship of My devotees is better than worship of Me.\" Similarly, in the Padma Puräëa, it is stated that the best mode of worship is to offer oblations to Viñëu, but better than that is to worship the devotees of Kåñëa. Thus Dakña's determination to neglect Lord Çiva in the sacrifices was not fitting."
