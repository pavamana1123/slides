    "translation": "The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, at the time King Påthu was enthroned by the great sages and brähmaëas and declared to be the protector of the citizens, there was a scarcity of food grains. The citizens actually became skinny due to starvation. Therefore they came before the King and informed him of their real situation.",

According to the varëäçrama system, the brähmaëas are considered to be the heads of the society and therefore to be situated in the topmost social position. The varëäçrama-dharma, the institution of four varëas and four äçramas, is very scientifically designed. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, varëäçrama-dharma is not a man-made institution, but is God-made. In this narration it is clearly indicated that the brähmaëas used to control the royal power. When an evil king like Vena ruled, the brähmaëas would kill him through their brahminical powers and would select a proper ruler by testing his qualifications. In other words, the brähmaëas, the intelligent men or great sages, would control the monarchical powers. Here we have an indication of how the brähmaëas elected King Påthu to the throne as the protector of the citizens. The citizens, being skinny due to hunger, approached the King and informed him that necessary action should be taken. The structure of the varëäçrama-dharma was so nice that the brähmaëas would guide the head of state. The head of state would then give protection to the citizens. The kñatriyas would take charge of protecting the people in general, and under the protection of the kñatriyas, the vaiçyas would protect the cows, produce food grains and distribute them. Çüdras, the working class, would help the higher three classes by manual labor. This is the perfect social system."
