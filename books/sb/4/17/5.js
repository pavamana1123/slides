            "content": "There are four Vaiñëava sampradäyas (systems) of disciplic succession. One sampradäya comes from Lord Brahmä, one from the goddess of fortune, one from the Kumäras, headed by Sanat-kumära, and one from Lord Çiva. These four systems of disciplic succession are still going on. As King Påthu has illustrated, one who is serious about receiving transcendental Vedic knowledge must accept a guru, or spiritual master, in one of these four disciplic successions. It is said that unless one accepts a mantra from one of these sampradäyas, the so-called mantra will not act in Kali-yuga. Many sampradäyas have sprung up without authority, and they are misleading the people by giving unauthorized mantras. The rascals of these so-called sampradäyas do not observe the Vedic rules and regulations. Although they are addicted to all kinds of sinful activities, they still offer the people mantras and thus mislead them. Intelligent persons, however, know that such mantras will never be successful, and as such they never patronize such upstart spiritual groups. People should be very careful of these nonsensical sampradäyas. To get some facility for sense gratification, unfortunate people in this age receive mantras from these so-called sampradäyas. Påthu Mahäräja, however, showed by his example that one should receive knowledge from a bona fide sampradäya. Therefore Mahäräja Påthu accepted Sanat-kumära as his spiritual master."
