Yajïas (sacrifices) are performed to produce sufficient clouds that will pour water over the earth. The word payaù can refer both to milk and to water. As one of the demigods, the earthly planet was taking her share in the yajïas—that is, she was eating green grass—but in return she was not producing sufficient food grains—that is, she was not filling her milk bag. Påthu Mahäräja was therefore justified in threatening to punish her for her offense."
