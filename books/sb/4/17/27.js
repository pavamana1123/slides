Although the earth assumed the shape of a cow by her mystic powers in order to be saved from being killed by the King, the King was aware of this fact and would not hesitate to cut her to pieces, just like small bits of grain. As far as the destruction of the citizens is concerned, Mahäräja Påthu maintained that he could uphold everyone by his own mystic powers. He did not need the help of the earthly planet. Being the incarnation of Lord Viñëu, Påthu Mahäräja possessed the power of Saìkarñaëa, which is explained by the scientists as the power of gravitation. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is holding millions of planets in space without any support; similarly, Påthu Mahäräja would not have had any difficulty supporting all his citizens and himself in space without the help of the planet earth. The Lord is known as Yogeçvara, master of all mystic powers. Consequently the planet earth was informed by the King that she need not worry about his standing without her help."
