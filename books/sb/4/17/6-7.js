    "translation": "Påthu Mahäräja was a powerful incarnation of Lord Kåñëa's potencies; consequently any narration concerning his activities is surely very pleasing to hear, and it produces all good fortune. As far as I am concerned, I am always your devotee as well as a devotee of the Lord, who is known as Adhokñaja. Please therefore narrate all the stories of King Påthu, who, in the form of the son of King Vena, milked the cow-shaped earth.",

            "content": "Lord Kåñëa is also known as avatäré, which means, \"one from whom all the incarnations emanate.\" In Bhagavad-gétä  Lord Kåñëa says, ahaà sarvasya prabhavo mattaù sarvaà pravartate: \"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.\" Thus Lord Kåñëa is the origin of everyone's appearance. As far as this material world is concerned, Lord Brahmä, Lord Viñëu and Lord Çiva are all emanations from Kåñëa. These three incarnations of Kåñëa are called guëa-avatäras. The material world is governed by three material modes of nature, and Lord Viñëu, Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva respectively take charge of the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Mahäräja Påthu is also an incarnation of those qualities of Lord Kåñëa by which one rules over conditioned souls."

            "content": "In this verse the word adhokñaja, meaning \"beyond the perception of the material senses,\" is very significant. No one can perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead by mental speculation; therefore a person with a poor fund of knowledge cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since one can form only an impersonal idea on the strength of one's material senses, the Lord is known as Adhokñaja."
