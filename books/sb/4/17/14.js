    "translation": "When the earth saw that King Påthu was taking his bow and arrow to kill her, she became very much afraid and began to tremble. She then began to flee, exactly like a deer, which runs very swiftly when followed by a hunter. Being afraid of King Påthu, she took the shape of a cow and began to run.",

Thus it is possible for mother earth to take on innumerable shapes. At this time, in order to avoid the wrath of King Påthu, she took the shape of a cow. Since a cow is never to be killed, mother earth thought it wise to take the shape of a cow in order to avoid King Påthu's arrows. King Påthu, however, could understand this fact, and therefore he did not stop chasing the cow-shaped earth."
