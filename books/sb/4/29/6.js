The living entity is assisted by these senses in acquiring knowledge and engaging in activity. The engagements of the senses are known as girl friends, and the serpent, which was described as having five heads, is the life air acting within the five circulatory processes.",

Thus he is given a chance to enjoy the senses. The senses are therefore the instruments for enjoying the material world; consequently the senses have been described as friends. Sometimes, because of too much sinful activity, the living entity does not get a material gross body, but hovers on the subtle platform. This is called ghostly life. Because of his not possessing a gross body, he creates a great deal of trouble in his subtle body. Thus the presence of a ghost is horrible for those who are living in the gross body.

There is präëa, apäna, udäna, vyäna and samäna, and because the life air functions in this fivefold way, it is compared to the five-hooded serpent. The soul passes through the kuëòaliné-cakra like a serpent crawling on the ground. The life air is compared to uraga, the serpent. Païca-våtti is the desire to satisfy the senses, attracted by five sense objects—namely form, taste, sound, smell and touch."
