            "content": "Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unknown to the conditioned soul, He is sometimes described in Vedic literatures as niräkära, avijïäta or aväì-mänasa-gocara. Actually it is a fact that the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be perceived by material senses as far as His form, name, quality, pastimes or paraphernalia are concerned. However, when one is spiritually advanced, one can understand the name, form, qualities, pastimes and paraphernalia of the Supreme Lord. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä . Bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù: one can understand in truth the Supreme Personality of Godhead only when one is engaged in devotional service. Ordinary persons engaged in pious and impious activities cannot understand the form, name and activities of the Lord. The devotee, however, can know the Personality of Godhead in many respects. He can understand that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that His address is Goloka Våndävana and that His activities are all spiritual. Because the Lord's form and activities cannot be understood by materialistic people, He is described by the çästras as niräkära, that is, one whose form cannot be ascertained by a materialistic person. This does not mean that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no form; it means that it is not understood by the karmés, or fruitive actors. His form is described in Brahma-saàhitä as sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1). As confirmed by the Padma Puräëa:"

            "content": "Since the name, form, qualities and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, cannot be understood by the material senses, He is also called adhokñaja, meaning \"beyond sense perception.\" When the senses are purified by devotional activity, the devotee understands everything about the Lord by the Lord's grace. In this verse the words pumbhir nämabhir vä kriyä-guëaiù are especially significant because God, Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has many names, activities and qualities, although none of them are material. Despite the fact that all these names, activities and pastimes are mentioned in the çästras and understood by the devotees, the karmés (fruitive laborers) cannot understand them. Nor can the jïänés (mental speculators) understand them. Although there are thousands of names of Lord Viñëu, the karmés and jïänés intermingle the names of the Supreme Godhead with the names of demigods and human beings. Because they cannot understand the actual name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they take for granted that any name can be accepted. They believe that since the Absolute Truth is impersonal, they can call Him by any name. Otherwise, they maintain, He has no name. This is not a fact. Here it is clearly stated: nämabhir vä kriyä-guëaiù. The Lord has specific names such as Räma, Kåñëa, Govinda, Näräyaëa, Viñëu and Adhokñaja. There are indeed many names, but the conditioned soul cannot understand them."
