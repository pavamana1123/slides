In this way, please give up your attraction for material existence.",

They generally desire to be promoted to heavenly planets, merge into the existence of Brahman, or keep themselves in the midst of family life, enchanted by the pleasures of the tongue and genitals. The great sage Närada clearly instructs King Barhiñmän not to remain his entire life in the gåhastha-äçrama. Being in the gåhastha-äçrama means being under the control of one's wife. One has to give up all this and put himself into the äçrama of the paramahaàsa, that is, put himself under the control of the spiritual master. The paramahaàsa-äçrama is the äçrama of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, under whom the spiritual master has taken shelter. The symptoms of the bona fide spiritual master are stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

If one takes shelter of the paramahaàsa spiritual master, gradually, through training and instruction, he will become detached from worldly life and ultimately return home, back to Godhead. The particular mention of aìganäçramam asattama-yütha-gätham is very interesting. The whole world is in the clutches of mäyä, being controlled by woman. Not only is one controlled by the woman who is one's wife, but one is also controlled by so many sex literatures. That is the cause of one's being entangled in the material world. One cannot give up this abominable association through one's own effort, but if one takes shelter of a bona fide spiritual master who is a paramahaàsa, he will gradually be elevated to the platform of spiritual life."

Real knowledge means understanding the miserable condition of material life. One should take shelter of a bona fide liberated soul, the spiritual master, and gradually elevate himself to the spiritual platform and thus become detached from the material world. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, haàsa-çaraëam refers to the cottage in which saintly persons live. Generally a saintly person lives in a remote place in the forest or in a humble cottage. However, we should note that the times have changed. It may be beneficial for a saintly person's own interest to go to the forest and live in a cottage, but if one becomes a preacher, especially in Western countries, he has to invite many classes of men who are accustomed to living in comfortable apartments. Therefore in this age a saintly person has to make proper arrangements to receive people and attract them to the message of Kåñëa consciousness. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, perhaps for the first time, introduced motorcars and palatial buildings for the residence of saintly persons just to attract the general public in big cities. The main fact is that one has to associate with a saintly person. In this age people are not going to search out a saint in the forest, so the saints and sages have to come to the big cities to make arrangements to receive the people in general, who are accustomed to the modern amenities of material life. Gradually such persons will learn that palatial buildings or comfortable apartments are not at all necessary. The real necessity is to become free from material bondage in whatever way possible. According to the orders of Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé:"
