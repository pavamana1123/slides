            "content": "When the world becomes degraded, civilization becomes demoniac, and for the common man the rectum and the genital are taken very seriously as the centers of all activity. Even in such a sacred place as Våndävana, India, unintelligent men pass off this rectal and genital business as spiritual activity. Such people are called sahajiyä. According to their philosophy, through sexual indulgence one can elevate oneself to the spiritual platform. From these verses of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, however, we understand that the desires for sexual satisfaction are meant for the arväk, the lowest among men. To rectify these rascals and fools is very difficult. After all, the sex desires of the common man are condemned in these verses. The word durmada means \"wrongly directed,\" and niråti means \"sinful activity.\" Although this clearly indicates that sex indulgence is abominable and misdirected even from the ordinary point of view, the sahajiyäs nonetheless pass themselves off as devotees conducting spiritual activities. For this reason, Våndävana is no longer visited by intelligent men. Sometimes we are often asked why we have made our center in Våndävana. From the external point of view, it can be concluded that Våndävana has become degenerate due to these sahajiyä activities, yet from the spiritual point of view, Våndävana is the only place where all these sinful persons can be rectified by means of taking birth in the forms of dogs, hogs and monkeys. By living in Våndävana as a dog, hog or monkey, the living entity can be elevated to the spiritual platform in the next life."
