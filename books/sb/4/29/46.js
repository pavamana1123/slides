Similarly, this verse indicates that those who are followers of the Vedic rituals, as well as those who are followers of fruitive activities, are unable to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In these two verses both the karmés and jïänés are described as unfit to understand Him.

It is said of the six Gosvämés: nänä-çästra-vicäraëaika-nipuëau sad-dharma-saàsthäpakau lokänäà hita-käriëau. A pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always thinking of how fallen, conditioned souls can be delivered. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, influenced by the merciful devotees' attempt to deliver fallen souls, enlightens the people in general from within by His causeless mercy. If a devotee is blessed by another devotee, he becomes free from karma-käëòa and jïäna-käëòa activities. As confirmed in Brahma-saàhitä, vedeñu durlabham: the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be realized through karma-käëòa and jïäna-käëòa. Adurlabham ätma-bhaktau: the Lord is realized only by a sincere devotee."

The Vedic instructions guide them according to different regulative principles, and intelligent people take advantage of these instructions. They thus enjoy material life without being disturbed. This is actually illusion, and to get out of this illusion by one's own endeavor is very difficult. The general populace is engaged in material activities, and when people are a little advanced, they become attracted by the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas. However, when one is frustrated in the performance of these ritualistic ceremonies, he again comes to material activities. In this way both the followers of the Vedic rituals and the followers of material activities are entangled in conditional life. These people get the seed of devotional service only by the good will of the guru and Kåñëa. This is confirmed in Caitanya-caritämåta: guru-kåñëa-prasäde päya bhakti-latä-béja ."

At such a time a devotee makes friends with another devotee, and his engagement in material activities ceases completely. At that time, he attains the favor of the Lord and loses his faith in material civilization, which begins with varëäçrama-dharma. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu speaks clearly of one's becoming liberated from the varëäçrama-dharma, the most exalted system of human civilization. At such a time one feels himself to be perpetually the servant of Lord Kåñëa, a position taken by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu Himself."
