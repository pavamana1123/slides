One may be very much attracted to becoming elevated to heavenly planets by performing great sacrifices, like those of King Barhiñmän. Çré Närada Muni wanted to stop King Barhiñmän from engaging in such fruitive activities. Therefore he is now directly telling him, \"Don't be interested in such temporary benefits.\" In modern civilization people are very much interested in exploiting the resources of material nature through the methods of science. Indeed, this is considered advancement. This is not actually advancement, however, but is simply pleasing to hear. Although we are advancing according to such concocted methods, we are forgetting our real purpose. Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura therefore says, jaòa-vidyä yata mäyära vaibhava tomära bhajane bädhä: \"Materialistic studies are the glare of mäyä only, for they are an obstacle to spiritual progress.\""

            "content": "The temporary comforts of life experienced either on this planet or on other planets are all to be taken as illusory because they do not touch the real purpose of life. The real purpose of life is to go back home, back to Godhead. Ignorant of the real purpose of life, people take to either gross materialistic activities or ritualistic activities. King Barhiñmän is herein requested not to be attached to such activities. In the Vedas it is stated that the performance of sacrifice is the actual purpose of life. A section of the Indian population known as the Ärya-samäjists lay too much stress on the sacrificial portion of the Vedas. This verse indicates, however, that such sacrifices are to be taken as illusory. Actually the aim of human life should be God realization, or Kåñëa consciousness. The Vedic performances are, of course, very glittering and pleasing to hear about, but they do not serve the real purpose of life."
