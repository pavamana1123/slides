Persons who are addicted to karma-käëòa-vicära, which means \"working for future happiness through fruitive activities,\" are also dreaming. Similarly, past happiness and present happiness are merely dreams. The actual reality is Kåñëa and service to Kåñëa, which can save us from the clutches of mäyä, for the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä , mäm eva ye prapadyante mäyäm etäà taranti te: \"Those who surrender unto Me can easily cross beyond My illusory energy.\""
