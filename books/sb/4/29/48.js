In the spiritual world there are many Vaikuëöha planets, and the topmost planet is Kåñëaloka, Goloka Våndävana. Despite the so-called advancement of civilization, there is no information of the Vaikuëöhalokas, the spiritual planets. At the present moment so-called advanced civilized men are trying to go to other planets, but they do not know that even if they go to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, they have to come back again to this planet. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä :"
