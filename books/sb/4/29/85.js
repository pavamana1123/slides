    "translation": "The allegory of King Puraïjana, described herein according to authority, was heard by me from my spiritual master, and it is full of spiritual knowledge. If one can understand the purpose of this allegory, he will certainly be relieved from the bodily conception and will clearly understand life after death. Although one may not understand what transmigration of the soul actually is, one can fully understand it by studying this narration.",

The attraction between male and female in this material world is very strong. In all species of life the attraction between male and female is the basic principle of existence. The same principle of intermingling is also in human society, but is in a regulative form. Material existence means living together as male and female and being attracted by one another. However, when one fully understands spiritual life, his attraction for the opposite sex is completely vanquished. By such attraction, one becomes overly attached to this material world. It is a hard knot within the heart."

By this attraction, one becomes overly attached to the material world in terms of gåha-kñetra-suta-äpta-vitta—that is, home, land, children, friends, money and so forth. Thus one becomes entangled in the bodily conception of \"I\" and \"mine.\" However, if one understands the story of King Puraïjana and understands how, by sexual attraction, Puraïjana became a female in his next life, one will also understand the process of transmigration."
