Before going to the place of Yamaräja, the living entity accepts Jarä, old age, the sister of Yamaräja. One is subjected to the influence of Yavana-räja and his sister due to impious activity. Those who are in Kåñëa consciousness and are engaged in devotional service under the instructions of Närada Muni are not subjected to the influence of Yamaräja and his sister Jarä. If one is Kåñëa conscious, he conquers death. After leaving the material body, he does not accept another body that is material but returns home, back to Godhead. This is verified by Bhagavad-gétä ."
