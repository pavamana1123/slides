    "translation": "Covered by the mode of ignorance in material nature, the living entity is sometimes a male, sometimes a female, sometimes a eunuch, sometimes a human being, sometimes a demigod, sometimes a bird, an animal, and so on. In this way he is wandering within the material world. His acceptance of different types of bodies is brought about by his activities under the influence of the modes of nature.",

The living entity is never material, and his material conception is simply a mistake due to forgetfulness. He is as brilliant as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Both the sun and the sunshine are very brilliant. The Lord is like the full shining sun, and the living entities are like the small particles of that sun which constitute the all-pervasive sunshine. When these small particles are covered by the cloud of mäyä, they lose their shining capacity. When the cloud of mäyä is gone, the particles again become brilliant and shining. As soon as the living entity is covered by the ignorance of mäyä, or darkness, he cannot understand his relationship with the Supreme God. Somehow or other, if he comes before the Lord, he can see himself as shining as the Supreme Lord, although he is not as extensive as the Lord. Because the living entity desires to imitate the Supreme Lord, he is covered by mäyä. We cannot imitate the Lord, nor can we become the supreme enjoyer. This is not possible, and when we think it is, we become conditioned by mäyä. Thus the encagement of the living entity under the clutches of mäyä is brought about by forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord."

            "content": "Under the influence of mäyä, the living entity becomes exactly like a person haunted by a ghost. Such a person speaks all kinds of nonsense. When the living entity is covered by the influence of mäyä, he becomes a so-called scientist, philosopher, politician or socialist, and at every moment presents different plans for the benefit of human society. All these plans are ultimately failures because they are illusory. In this way the living entity forgets his position as an eternal servant of the Lord. He instead becomes a servant of mäyä. In any case he remains a servant. It is his misfortune that by forgetting his real contact with the Supreme Lord, he becomes a servant of mäyä. As servant of mäyä, he sometimes becomes a king, sometimes an ordinary citizen, sometimes a brähmaëa, a çüdra, and so on. Sometimes he is a happy man, sometimes a prosperous man, sometimes a small insect. Sometimes he is in heaven and sometimes in hell. Sometimes he is a demigod, and sometimes he is a demon. Sometimes he is a servant, and sometimes he is a master. In this way the living entity wanders all over the universe. Only when he comes in contact with the bona fide spiritual master can he understand his real constitutional position. He then becomes disgusted with material existence. At that time, in full Kåñëa consciousness, he regrets his past experiences in material existence. This regret is very beneficial because it purifies the living entity of material, conditional life. He then prays to the Lord to engage in His service, and at that time, Kåñëa grants liberation from the clutches of mäyä. Lord Kåñëa explains this in Bhagavad-gétä :"

When the living entity understands his real position by the grace of Kåñëa, he keeps himself always fit in Kåñëa consciousness and acts accordingly. Thus he gradually becomes completely free from the clutches of mäyä. When he is strong in Kåñëa consciousness, mäyä cannot touch him. In this way, in the association of Kåñëa conscious devotees, the living entity can get free from the contamination of material existence. In this connection, Çréla Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja Gosvämé says:"
