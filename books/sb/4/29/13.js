    "translation": "Närada Muni continued: The city spoken of as Dakñiëa-païcäla represents the scriptures meant for directing pravåtti, the process of sense enjoyment in fruitive activities. The other city, named Uttara-païcäla, represents the scriptures meant for decreasing fruitive activities and increasing knowledge. The living entity receives different kinds of knowledge by means of two ears, and some living entities are promoted to Pitåloka and some to Devaloka. All this is made possible by the two ears.",

As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, one can be promoted to the planets of the demigods or to the planets of the Pitäs (forefathers), or even to the Vaikuëöha planets, simply through the process of hearing. These things have already been explained in previous chapters."
