    "translation": "My dear King, the entire world is covered with the sharp points of kuça grass, and on the strength of this you have become proud because you have killed various types of animals in sacrifices. Because of your foolishness, you do not know that devotional service is the only way one can please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You cannot understand this fact. Your only activities should be those that can please the Personality of Godhead. Our education should be such that we can become elevated to Kåñëa consciousness.",

The King was thinking that he was great for having performed so many sacrifices, but the great sage Närada directly chastises him, informing him that his animal-killing only leads to his being puffed up with false prestige. Actually, anything that is done which does not lead to Kåñëa consciousness is a sinful activity, and any education that does not lead one to understand Kåñëa is false education. If Kåñëa consciousness is missing, one is simply engaged in false activities and false educational pursuits."
