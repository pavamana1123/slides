    "translation": "Kåñëa consciousness means constantly associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in such a mental state that the devotee can observe the cosmic manifestation exactly as the Supreme Personality of Godhead does. Such observation is not always possible, but it becomes manifest exactly like the dark planet known as Rähu, which is observed in the presence of the full moon.",

Sometimes, however, by the supreme will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the whole stockpile can be visible all at one time. In Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38) it is said, karmäëi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhäjäm. When a person is fully absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness, his stockpile of material desires is minimized. Indeed, the desires no longer fructify in the form of gross bodies. Instead, the stockpile of desires becomes visible on the mental platform by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

            "content": "In this connection, the darkness occurring before the full moon, the lunar eclipse, can be explained as being another planet, known as Rähu. According to Vedic astronomy, the Rähu planet, which is not visible, is accepted. Sometimes the Rähu planet is visible in the presence of full moonlight. It then appears that this Rähu planet exists somewhere near the orbit of the moon. The failure of modern moon excursionists may be due to the Rähu planet. In other words, those who are supposed to be going to the moon may actually be going to this invisible planet Rähu. Actually, they are not going to the moon but to the planet Rähu, and after reaching this planet, they come back. Apart from this discussion, the point is that a living entity has immense and unlimited desires for material enjoyment, and he has to transmigrate from one gross body to another until these desires are exhausted."

            "content": "No living entity is free from the cycle of birth and death unless he takes to Kåñëa consciousness; therefore in this verse it is clearly stated (sattvaika-niñöhe) that when one is fully absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness, in one stroke he is freed of past and future mental desires. Then, by the grace of the Supreme Lord, everything becomes simultaneously manifest within the mind. In this regard, Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura cites the example of mother Yaçodä's seeing the whole cosmic manifestation within the mouth of Lord Kåñëa. By the grace of Lord Kåñëa, mother Yaçodä saw all the universes and planets within the mouth of Kåñëa. Similarly, by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, a Kåñëa conscious person can see all his dormant desires at one time and finish all his future transmigrations. This facility is especially given to the devotee to make his path clear for returning home, back to Godhead."

Because a Kåñëa conscious person does not have to accept a future gross body, his recorded desires are fulfilled in a dream. We therefore sometimes find things in a dream never experienced in our present life."
