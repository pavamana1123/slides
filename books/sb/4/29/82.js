This definitely proves that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always a person. In His impersonal feature, He is the rays of His transcendental body. When a living entity attains spiritual perfection, he also attains the same type of body, known as sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1). This spiritual body never mixes with the material elements. Although in conditional life the living entity is surrounded by material elements (earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and ego), he remains always aloof from them. In other words, the living entity can be liberated from the material condition at any moment, provided that he wishes to do so. The material environment is called mäyä. According to Kåñëa:"

On the brahma-bhüta platform the living entity is liberated from material bondage, and he engages in the service of the Lord. In this verse the word dhéra is sometimes read as véra. Actually there is not very much difference. The word dhéra means \"sober,\" and véra means \"hero.\" One who is struggling against mäyä is a hero, and one who is sober enough to understand his position is a dhéra. Without becoming sober or heroic, one cannot attain spiritual salvation."
