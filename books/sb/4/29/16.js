    "translation": "The word antaù-pura refers to the heart. The word viñücéna, meaning \"going everywhere,\" indicates the mind.

The heart feels satisfaction, jubilation or illusion according to the effects of the modes of material nature. Actually the living entity in his material condition remains inert. It is the modes of material nature that act on the mind and heart. The results are enjoyed or suffered by the living entity. This is clearly stated in Bhagavad-gétä :"
