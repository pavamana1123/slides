If they were aware of it, why did they not explain it to me?",

            "content": "Actually the so-called teachers or leaders of material society do not really know the goal of life. They are described in Bhagavad-gétä as mäyayäpahåta jïänäù  Kåñëa says, aham ädir hi devänäà: \"I am the source of the demigods.\" Thus Kåñëa is the origin and beginning of all demigods, including Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and all others. The Vedic ritualistic ceremonies are concerned with satisfying different demigods, but unless one is very advanced, he cannot understand that the original personality is Çré Kåñëa. Govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi. After hearing the instructions of Närada, King Barhiñmän came to his senses. The real goal of life is to attain devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The King therefore decided to reject the so-called priestly orders that simply engage their followers in the ritualistic ceremonies without giving effective instructions about the goal of life. At the present moment the churches, temples and mosques all over the world are not attracting people because foolish priests cannot elevate their followers to the platform of knowledge. Not being aware of the real goal of life, they simply keep their congregations in ignorance. Consequently, those who are well educated have become uninterested in the ritualistic ceremonies. At the same time, they are not benefited with real knowledge. This Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore very important for the enlightenment of all classes. Following in the footsteps of Mahäräja Barhiñmän, everyone should take advantage of this Kåñëa consciousness movement and abandon the stereotyped ritualistic ceremonies that go under the garb of so many religions. The Gosvämés from the very beginning differed from the priestly class that was engaged in ritualistic ceremonies. Indeed, Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé compiled his Hari-bhakti-viläsa for the guidance of the Vaiñëavas. The Vaiñëavas, not caring for the lifeless activities of the priestly classes, take to full Kåñëa consciousness and become perfect in this very life. That is described in the previous verse as paramahaàsa-çaraëam, taking shelter of the paramahaàsa, the liberated soul, and becoming successful in this life."
