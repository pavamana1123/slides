            "content": "In this verse the words dayä jéveñu, meaning \"mercy to other living entities,\" indicate that a living entity must be merciful to other living entities if he wishes to make progress in self-realization. This means he must preach this knowledge after perfecting himself and understanding his own position as an eternal servant of Kåñëa. Preaching this is showing real mercy to living entities. Other types of humanitarian work may be temporarily beneficial for the body, but because a living entity is spirit soul, ultimately one can show him real mercy only by revealing knowledge of his spiritual existence. As Caitanya Mahäprabhu says, jévera 'svarüpa' haya-kåñëera 'nitya-däsa':  \"Every living entity is constitutionally a servant of Kåñëa.\" One should know this fact perfectly and should preach it to the mass of people. If one realizes that he is an eternal servant of Kåñëa but does not preach it, his realization is imperfect. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura therefore sings, duñöa mana, tumi kisera vaiñëava? pratiñöhära tare, nirjanera ghare, tava hari-näma kevala kaitava: \"My dear mind, what kind of Vaiñëava are you? Simply for false prestige and a material reputation you are chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra in a solitary place.\" In this way people who do not preach are criticized. There are many Vaiñëavas in Våndävana who do not like preaching; they chiefly try to imitate Haridäsa Öhäkura. The actual result of their so-called chanting in a secluded place, however, is that they sleep and think of women and money. Similarly, one who simply engages in temple worship but does not see to the interests of the mass of people or cannot recognize devotees is called a kaniñöha-adhikäri:"
