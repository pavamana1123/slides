    "translation": "The most powerful Lord Brahmä, the father of all progenitors; Lord Çiva; Manu, Dakña and the other rulers of humankind; the four saintly first-class brahmacärés headed by Sanaka and Sanätana; the great sages Maréci, Atri, Aìgirä, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Bhågu and Vasiñöha; and my humble self [Närada] are all stalwart brähmaëas who can speak authoritatively on Vedic literature. We are very powerful because of austerities, meditation and education. Nonetheless, even after inquiring about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whom we always see, we do not know perfectly about Him.",

            "content": "According to the foolish Darwinian theory of the anthropologists, it is said that forty thousand years ago Homo sapiens had not appeared on this planet because the process of evolution had not reached that point. However, the Vedic histories—the puräëas and Mahäbhärata—relate human histories that extend millions and millions of years into the past. In the beginning of creation there was a very intelligent personality, Lord Brahmä, and from him emanated all the Manus, and the brahmacärés like Sanaka and Sanätana, as well as Lord Çiva, the great sages and Närada. All these personalities underwent great austerities and penances and thus became authorities in Vedic knowledge. Perfect knowledge for human beings, as well as all living entities, is contained in the Vedas. All the above-mentioned great personalities are not only powerful—being cognizant of past, present and future—but are also devotees. Still, in spite of their great education in knowledge, and despite their meeting the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viñëu, they cannot actually understand the perfection of the living entity's relationship with Lord Viñëu. This means that these personalities are still limited as far as their knowledge of the unlimited is concerned. The conclusion is that simply by advancing one's knowledge, one cannot be accepted as an expert in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can be understood not by advanced knowledge, but by pure devotional service, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä . Bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù: unless one takes to pure, transcendental devotional service, he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in truth. Everyone has some imperfect ideas about the Lord. So-called scientists and philosophical speculators are unable to understand the Supreme Lord by virtue of their knowledge. Knowledge is not perfect unless one comes to the platform of devotional service. This is confirmed by the Vedic version:"

All the great sages mentioned in this verse have their planets near Brahmaloka, the planet where Lord Brahmä resides along with four great sages—Sanaka, Sanätana, Sanandana and Sanat-kumära. These sages reside in different stars known as the southern stars, which circle the polestar. The polestar, called Dhruvaloka, is the pivot of this universe, and all planets move around this polestar. All the stars are planets, as far as we can see, within this one universe. According to Western theory, all the stars are different suns, but according to Vedic information, there is only one sun within this universe. All the so-called stars are but different planets. Besides this universe, there are many millions of other universes, and each of them contains similar innumerable stars and planets."
