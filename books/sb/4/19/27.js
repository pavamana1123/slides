    "translation": "When the priests and all the others saw Mahäräja Påthu very angry and prepared to kill Indra, they requested him: O great soul, do not kill him, for only sacrificial animals can be killed in a sacrifice. Such are the directions given by çästra.",

It tests the proper pronunciation of Vedic mantras, and an animal being put into the sacrificial fire should come out with a new life. No one should ever be killed in a sacrifice meant for the satisfaction of Lord Viñëu. How then could Indra be killed when he is actually worshiped in the yajïa and accepted as part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? Therefore the priests requested King Påthu not to kill him."
