            "content": "In this verse the word säkñät is significant. Påthu Mahäräja was a çaktyäveça-avatära incarnation of Lord Viñëu. Actually Påthu Mahäräja was a living entity, but he acquired specific powers from Lord Viñëu. Lord Viñëu, however, is directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus belongs to the category of viñëu-tattva. Mahäräja Påthu belonged to the jéva-tattva. The viñëu-tattva indicates God, whereas the jéva-tattva indicates the part and parcel of God. When God's part and parcel is especially empowered, he is called çaktyäveça-avatära. Lord Viñëu is herein described as harir éçvaraù. The Lord is so kind that He takes all miserable conditions away from His devotees. Consequently He is called Hari. He is described as éçvara because He can do whatever He likes. He is the supreme controller. The supreme éçvara puruñottama is Lord Kåñëa. He exhibits His powers as éçvara, or the supreme controller, when He assures His devotee in Bhagavad-gétä : \"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.\" He can immediately make His devotee immune from all the reactions caused by sinful life if the devotee simply surrenders unto Him. He is described herein as sarvätmä, meaning that He is present in everyone's heart as the Supersoul, and as such He is the supreme teacher of everyone. If we are fortunate enough to take the lessons given by Lord Kåñëa in Bhagavad-gétä, our lives immediately become successful. No one can give better instructions to human society than Lord Kåñëa."
