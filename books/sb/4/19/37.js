When His incarnation is present on this planet or in this universe, the Lord kills the demons and protects His devotees simultaneously. Sometimes Lord Viñëu appears in His person as Lord Kåñëa or Lord Räma. All of these appearances are mentioned in the çästras. Sometimes He appears as a çaktyäveça-avatära like Lord Buddha. As explained before, these çaktyäveça-avatäras are incarnations of Viñëu's power invested in a living entity. Living entities are also part and parcel of Lord Viñëu, but they are not as powerful; therefore when a living entity descends as an incarnation of Viñëu, he is especially empowered by the Lord."

            "content": "When King Påthu is described as an incarnation of Lord Viñëu, it should be understood that he is a çaktyäveça-avatära, part and parcel of Lord Viñëu, and is specifically empowered by Him. Any living being acting as the incarnation of Lord Viñëu is thus empowered by Lord Viñëu to preach the bhakti cult. Such a person can act like Lord Viñëu and defeat demons by arguments and preach the bhakti cult exactly according to the principles of çästra. As indicated in Bhagavad-gétä, whenever we find someone extraordinary preaching the bhakti cult, we should know that he is especially empowered by Lord Viñëu, or Lord Kåñëa. As confirmed in Caitanya-caritämåta , kåñëa-çakti vinä nahe tära pravartana: one cannot explain the glories of the holy name of the Lord without being specifically empowered by Him. If one criticizes or finds fault with such an empowered personality, one is to be considered an offender against Lord Viñëu and is punishable. Even though such offenders may dress as Vaiñëavas with false tilaka and mälä, they are never forgiven by the Lord if they offend a pure Vaiñëava. There are many instances of this in the çästras."
