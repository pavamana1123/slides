We should know, however, that the animals sacrificed in the yajïa were not killed. If the Vedic mantras were properly pronounced during the sacrifice, the animal sacrificed would come out again with a new life. That is the test for a successful yajïa. When King Påthu was performing one hundred yajïas, Indra became very envious because he did not want anyone to excel him. Being an ordinary living entity, he became envious of King Påthu, and, making himself invisible, he stole the horse and thus impeded the yajïa performance."
