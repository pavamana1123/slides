    "translation": "King Påthu was dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is known as Adhokñaja. Because King Påthu Performed so many sacrifices, he was superhumanly enhanced by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. King Påthu's opulence, however, could not be tolerated by the King of heaven, Indra, who tried to impede the progress of his opulence.",

            "content": "In this verse there are three significant purposes expressed in the words adhokñaja, bhagavän indraù and påthoù. Mahäräja Påthu is an incarnation of Viñëu, yet he is a great devotee of Lord Viñëu. Although an empowered incarnation of Lord Viñëu, he is nonetheless a living entity. As such, he must be a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although one is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is an incarnation, he should not forget his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Kali-yuga there are many self-made incarnations, rascals, who declare themselves to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words bhagavän indraù indicate that a living entity can even be as exalted and powerful as King Indra, for even King Indra is an ordinary living entity in the material world and possesses the four defects of the conditioned soul. King Indra is described herein as bhagavän, which is generally used in reference to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this case, however, King Indra is addressed as bhagavän because he has so much power in his hands. Despite his becoming bhagavän, he is envious of the incarnation of God, Påthu Mahäräja. The defects of material life are so strong that due to contamination King Indra becomes envious of an incarnation of God."

            "content": "We should try to understand, therefore, how a conditioned soul becomes fallen. The opulence of King Påthu was not dependent on material conditions. As described in this verse, he was a great devotee of Adhokñaja. The word adhokñaja indicates the Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the expression of mind and words. However, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears before the devotee in His original form of eternal bliss and knowledge. The devotee is allowed to see the Supreme Lord face to face, although the Lord is beyond the expression of our senses and beyond our direct perception."
