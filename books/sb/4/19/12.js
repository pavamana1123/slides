    "translation": "When King Indra was taking away the horse, he dressed himself to appear as a liberated person. Actually this dress was a form of cheating, for it falsely created an impression of religion. When Indra went into outer space in this way, the great sage Atri saw him and understood the whole situation.",

            "content": "The word päkhaëòa used in this verse is sometimes pronounced päñaëòa. Both of these words indicate an imposter who presents himself as a very religious person but in actuality is sinful. Indra took up the saffron-colored dress as a way of cheating others. This saffron dress has been misused by many imposters who present themselves as liberated persons or incarnations of God. In this way people are cheated. As we have mentioned many times, the conditioned soul has a tendency to cheat; therefore this quality is also visible in a person like King Indra. It is understood that even King Indra is not liberated from the clutches of material contamination. Thus the words ämuktam iva, meaning \"as if he were liberated,\" are used. The saffron dress worn by a sannyäsé announces to the world that he has renounced all worldly affairs and is simply engaged in the service of the Lord. Such a devotee is actually a sannyäsé, or liberated person. In Bhagavad-gétä  it is said:"

            "content": "In other words, one who offers the results of his activities to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually a sannyäsé and yogé. Cheating sannyäsés and yogés have existed since the time of Påthu Mahäräja's sacrifice. This cheating was very foolishly introduced by King Indra. In some ages such cheating is very prominent, and in other ages not so prominent. It is the duty of a sannyäsé to be very cautious because, as stated by Lord Caitanya, sannyäséra alpa chidra sarva-loke gäya: a little spot in a sannyäsé's character will be magnified by the public . Therefore, unless one is very sincere and serious, he should not take up the order of sannyäsa. One should not use this order as a means to cheat the public. It is better not to take up sannyäsa in this age of Kali because provocations are very strong in this age. Only a very exalted person advanced in spiritual understanding should attempt to take up sannyäsa. One should not adopt this order as a means of livelihood or for some material purpose."
