            "content": "In this verse the word dharma-dughä is significant, for it indicates käma-dhenu. Käma-dhenu is also known as surabhi. Surabhi cows inhabit the spiritual world, and, as stated in Brahma-saàhitä, Lord Kåñëa is engaged in tending these cows: surabhér abhipälayantam (BS 5.29). One can milk a surabhi cow as often as one likes, and the cow will deliver as much milk as one requires. Milk, of course, is necessary for the production of so many milk products, especially clarified butter, which is required for the performance of great sacrifices. Unless we are prepared to perform the prescribed sacrifices, our supply of the necessities of life will be checked. Bhagavad-gétä confirms that Lord Brahmä created human society along with yajïa, the performance of sacrifice. Yajïa means Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and sacrifice means working for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, however, it is very difficult to find qualified brähmaëas who can perform sacrifices as prescribed in the Vedas. Therefore it is recommended in Çrémad-Bhägavatam ( yajïaiù saìkértana-präyaiù) that by performing saìkértana-yajïa and by satisfying the yajïa-puruña, Lord Caitanya, one can derive all the results derived by great sacrifices in the past. King Påthu and others derived all the necessities of life from the earthly planet by performing great sacrifices. Now this saìkértana movement has already been started by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. People should take advantage of this great sacrifice and join in the Society's activities; then there will be no scarcity. If saìkértana-yajïa is performed, there will be no difficulty, not even in industrial enterprises. Therefore this system should be introduced in all spheres of life—social, political, industrial, commercial, etc. Then everything will run very peacefully and smoothly."
