A tridaëòi-sannyäsé is a Vaiñëava sannyäsé, and an ekadaëòi-sannyäsé is a Mäyävädé sannyäsé. There are many other types of sannyäsés, who are not approved by Vedic rituals. A type of pseudo-sannyäsa was introduced by Indra when he tried to hide himself from the attack of Vijitäçva, the great son of King Påthu. Now there are many different types of sannyäsés. Some of them go naked, and some of them carry a skull and trident, generally known as käpälika. All of them were introduced under some meaningless circumstances, and those who have a poor fund of knowledge accept these false sannyäsés and their pretenses, although they are not bona fide guides to spiritual advancement. At the present moment some missionary institutions, without referring to the Vedic rituals, have introduced some sannyäsés who engage in sinful activities. The sinful activities forbidden by the çästras are illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. These so-called sannyäsés indulge in all these activities. They eat meat and flesh, fish, eggs and just about everything. They sometimes drink with the excuse that without alcohol, fish and meat, it is impossible to remain in the cold countries near the Arctic zone. These sannyäsés introduce all these sinful activities in the name of serving the poor, and consequently poor animals are cut to pieces and go into the bellies of these sannyäsés. As described in the following verses, such sannyäsés are päkhaëòés. Vedic literature states that a person who puts Lord Näräyaëa on the level with Lord Çiva or Lord Brahmä immediately becomes a päkhaëòé. As stated in the Puräëas:"

Those who take advantage of this saìkértana movement of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness will be able to save themselves from the influence of these päkhaëòés."
