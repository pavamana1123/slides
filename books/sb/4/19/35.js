A karmé must be envious because he wishes to enjoy material pleasures to their fullest extent. That is the material disease. Consequently there is always competition amongst karmés, either in ordinary business affairs or in the performance of yajïa. Lord Brahmä's purpose was to end the competition between Lord Indra and Mahäräja Påthu. Because Mahäräja Påthu was a great devotee and incarnation of God, he was requested to stop the sacrifices so that Indra might not further introduce irreligious systems, which are always followed by criminal-minded people."
