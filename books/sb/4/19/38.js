Mahäräja Påthu was empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead for this purpose only. It is the duty of the ideal king to see that people are properly executing religious principles. Lord Brahmä especially requested King Påthu to conquer the pseudoreligious principles produced by King Indra. In other words, it is the duty of the state or king to put a stop to pseudoreligious systems produced by unscrupulous persons. Originally a religious principle is one, given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and it comes through the channel of disciplic succession in two forms. Lord Brahmä requested Påthu Mahäräja to desist from his unnecessary competition with Indra, who was determined to stop Påthu Mahäräja from completing one hundred yajïas. Instead of creating adverse reactions, it was better for Mahäräja Påthu to stop the yajïas in the interest of his original purpose as an incarnation. This purpose was to establish good government and set things in the right order."
