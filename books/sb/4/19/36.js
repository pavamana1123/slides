Consequently he stole the horse and hid himself amid so many irreligious personalities, taking on the false guise of a sannyäsé. Such activities are attractive to the people in general; therefore they are dangerous. Lord Brahmä thought that instead of allowing Indra to further introduce such irreligious systems, it would be better to stop the sacrifice. A similar stance was taken by Lord Buddha when people were overly engrossed in the animal sacrifices recommended by Vedic instructions. Lord Buddha had to introduce the religion of nonviolence by contradicting the Vedic sacrificial instructions. Actually, in the sacrifices the slaughtered animals were given a new life, but people without such powers were taking advantage of such Vedic rituals and unnecessarily killing poor animals. Therefore Lord Buddha had to deny the authority of the Vedas for the time being. One should not perform sacrifices that will induce reversed orders. It is better to stop such sacrifices."

            "content": "As we have repeatedly explained, due to a lack of qualified brahminical priests in Kali-yuga, it is not possible to perform the ritualistic ceremonies recommended in the Vedas. Consequently the çästras instruct us to perform the saìkértana-yajïa. By the saìkértana sacrifice, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His form of Lord Caitanya, will be satisfied and worshiped. The entire purpose of performing sacrifices is to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu. Lord Viñëu, or Lord Kåñëa, is present in His form of Lord Caitanya; therefore people who are intelligent should try to satisfy Him by performing saìkértana-yajïa. This is the easiest way to satisfy Lord Viñëu in this age. people should take advantage of the injunctions in different çästras concerning sacrifices in this age and not create unnecessary disturbances during the sinful age of Kali. In Kali-yuga men all over the world are very expert in opening slaughterhouses for killing animals, which they eat. If the old ritualistic ceremonies were observed, people would be encouraged to kill more and more animals. In Calcutta there are many butcher shops which keep a deity of the goddess Kälé, and animal-eaters think it proper to purchase animal flesh from such shops in hope that they are eating the remnants of food offered to goddess Kälé. They do not know that goddess Kälé never accepts nonvegetarian food because she is the chaste wife of Lord Çiva. Lord Çiva is also a great Vaiñëava and never eats nonvegetarian food, and the goddess Kälé accepts the remnants of food left by Lord Çiva. Therefore there is no possibility of her eating flesh or fish. Such offerings are accepted by the associates of goddess Kälé known as bhütas, piçäcas and Räkñasas, and those who take the prasäda of goddess Kälé in the shape of flesh or fish are not actually taking the prasäda left by goddess Kälé, but the food left by the bhütas and piçäcas."
