            "content": "Lord Brahmä came down to pacify King Påthu regarding his continual performance of one hundred sacrifices. King Påthu was determined to perform one hundred sacrifices, and King Indra took this very seriously because Indra himself was known as the performer of one hundred sacrifices. Just as it is the nature of all living entities within this material world to become envious of their competitors, King Indra, although King of heaven, was also envious of King Påthu and therefore wanted to stop him from performing one hundred sacrifices. Actually there was great competition, and King Indra, to satisfy his senses, began to invent so many irreligious systems to obstruct King Påthu. To stop these irreligious inventions, Lord Brahmä personally appeared in the sacrificial arena. As far as Mahäräja Påthu was concerned, he was a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore it was not necessary for him to perform the prescribed Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. Such ceremonies are known as karma, and there is no need for a devotee in the transcendental position to execute them. As the ideal king, however, it was King Påthu's duty to perform sacrifices. A compromise was therefore to be worked out. By the blessings of Lord Brahmä, King Påthu would become more famous than King Indra. Thus Påthu's determination to perform one hundred sacrifices was indirectly fulfilled by the blessings of Lord Brahmä."
