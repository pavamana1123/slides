However, when a kñatriya out of cowardice flees from the battlefield, showing his back to his enemy, he is challenged with the words tiñöha tiñöha. A real kñatriya does not kill his enemy from behind, nor does a real kñatriya turn his back on the battlefield. According to kñatriya principle and spirit, one either attains victory or dies on the battlefield. Although King Indra was very exalted, being the King of heaven, he became degraded due to his stealing the horse intended for sacrifice. Therefore he fled without observing the kñatriya principles, and the son of Påthu had to challenge him with the words tiñöha tiñöha."
