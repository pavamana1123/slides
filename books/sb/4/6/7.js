The Lord asks everyone to give up all kinds of concocted occupations and simply surrender unto Him. That will protect the conditioned souls from all sinful reactions. Similarly, in this case Brahmä also suggested that they go and surrender unto the lotus feet of Lord Çiva, for since he is very kind and easily satisfied, this action would prove effective."
