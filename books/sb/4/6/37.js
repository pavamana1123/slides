In this verse it is specifically mentioned that he was speaking to the great sage Närada, a celebrated devotee. Närada was asking Lord Çiva about devotional service, and Çiva, being the topmost Vaiñëava, was instructing him. In other words, Lord Çiva and Närada were discussing the knowledge of the Veda, but it is to be understood that the subject matter was devotional service. Another point in this connection is that Lord Çiva is the supreme instructor and the great sage Närada is the supreme audience. Therefore, the supreme subject matter of Vedic knowledge is bhakti, or devotional service."
