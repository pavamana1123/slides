            "content": "The sitting posture described herein is called véräsana according to the system of añöäìga-yoga performances. In the performance of yoga there are eight divisions, such as yama and niyama—controlling, following the rules and regulations, then practicing the sitting postures, etc. Besides véräsana there are other sitting postures, such as padmäsana and siddhäsana. Practice of these äsanas without elevating oneself to the position of realizing the Supersoul, Viñëu, is not the perfectional stage of yoga. Lord Çiva is called yogéçvara, the master of all yogés, and Kåñëa is also called yogeçvara. Yogéçvara indicates that no one can surpass the yoga practice of Lord Çiva, and yogeçvara indicates that no one can surpass the yogic perfection of Kåñëa. Another significant word is tarka-mudrä. This indicates that the fingers are opened and the second finger is raised, along with the arm, to impress the audience with some subject matter. This is actually a symbolic representation."
