            "content": "Lord Çiva is described here as adhéçvara. Éçvara means \"controller,\" and adhéçvara means particularly \"controller of the senses.\" Generally our materially contaminated senses are apt to engage in sense gratificatory activities, but when a person is elevated by wisdom and austerity, the senses then become purified, and they become engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Çiva is the emblem of such perfection, and therefore in the scriptures it is said, vaiñëavänäà yathä çambhuù: Lord Çiva is a Vaiñëava. Lord Çiva, by his actions within this material world, teaches all conditioned souls how to engage in devotional service twenty-four hours a day. Therefore he is described here as loka-maìgala, good fortune personified for all conditioned souls."
