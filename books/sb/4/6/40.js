    "translation": "Lord Çiva's lotus feet were worshiped by both the demigods and demons, but still, in spite of his exalted position, as soon as he saw that Lord Brahmä was there among all the other demigods, he immediately stood up and offered him respect by bowing down and touching his lotus feet, just as Vämanadeva offered His respectful obeisances to Kaçyapa Muni.",

            "content": "Kaçyapa Muni was in the category of the living entities, but he had a transcendental son, Vämanadeva, who was an incarnation of Viñëu. Thus although Lord Viñëu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He offered His respects to Kaçyapa Muni. Similarly, when Lord Kåñëa was a child He used to offer His respectful obeisances to His mother and father, Nanda and Yaçodä. Also, at the Battle of Kurukñetra, Lord Kåñëa touched the feet of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira because the King was His elder. It appears, then, that the Personality of Godhead, Lord Çiva and other devotees, in spite of their being situated in exalted positions, instructed by practical example how to offer obeisances to their superiors. Lord Çiva offered his respectful obeisances to Brahmä because Brahmä was his father, just as Kaçyapa Muni was the father of Vämana."
