In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, First Canto, , it is stated that everyone should try to understand whether the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by his activity. In other words, the aim of our activities should be to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as in an office it is the duty of the worker to see that the proprietor or the master is satisfied, so everyone's duty is to see whether the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by one's activity. Activities to satisfy the Supreme Godhead are prescribed in the Vedic literature, and execution of such activities is called yajïa. In other words, acting on behalf of the Supreme Lord is called yajïa. One should know very well that any activity besides yajïa is the cause of material bondage. That is explained in Bhagavad-gétä : yajïärthät karmaëo 'nyatra loko 'yaà karma-bandhanaù. Karma-bandhanaù means that if we do not work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, then the reaction of our work will bind us. One should not work for his own sense gratification. Everyone should work for the satisfaction of God. That is called yajïa."

            "content": "After the yajïa was performed by Dakña, all the demigods expected prasäda, the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Viñëu. Lord Çiva is one of the demigods, so naturally he also expected his share of the prasäda from the yajïa. But Dakña, out of his envy of Lord Çiva, neither invited Çiva to participate in the yajïa nor gave him his share after the offering. But after the destruction of the yajïa arena by the followers of Lord Çiva, Lord Brahmä pacified him and assured him that he would get his share of prasäda. Thus he was requested to rectify whatever destruction was caused by his followers."

            "content": "In Bhagavad-gétä  it is said that all the demigods are satisfied when one performs yajïa. Because the demigods expect prasäda from yajïas, yajïa must be performed. Those who engage in sense gratificatory, materialistic activities must perform yajïa, otherwise they will be implicated. Thus Dakña, being the father of mankind, was performing yajïa, and Lord Çiva expected his share. But since Çiva was not invited, there was trouble. By the mediation of Lord Brahmä, however, everything was settled satisfactorily."

            "content": "The performance of yajïa is a very difficult task because all the demigods must be invited to participate in the yajïa. In this Kali-yuga it is not possible to perform such costly sacrifices, nor is it possible to invite the demigods to participate. Therefore in this age it is recommended, yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù . Those who are intelligent should know that in the Kali-yuga there is no possibility of performing the Vedic sacrifices. But unless one pleases the demigods, there will be no regulated seasonal activities or rainfall. Everything is controlled by the demigods. Under the circumstances, in this age, in order to keep the balance of social peace and prosperity, all intelligent men should execute the performance of saìkértana-yajïa by chanting the holy names Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. One should invite people, chant Hare Kåñëa, and then distribute prasäda. This yajïa will satisfy all the demigods, and thus there will be peace and prosperity in the world. Another difficulty in performing the Vedic rituals is that if one fails to satisfy even one demigod out of the many hundreds of thousands of demigods, just as Dakña failed to satisfy Lord Çiva, there will be disaster. But in this age the performance of sacrifice has been simplified. One can chant Hare Kåñëa, and by pleasing Kåñëa one can satisfy all the demigods automatically."
