    "translation": "There is a small lake named Alakanandä in which Saté used to take her bath, and that lake is especially auspicious. All the demigods, after seeing the specific beauty of Kailäsa Hill, were struck with wonder at the great opulence to be found there.",

In other words, the Ganges flowed through the Kailäsa-parvata. There is every possibility of accepting such a statement because Ganges water also flows from the hair of Lord Çiva. Since Ganges water rests on the head of Lord Çiva and then flows to the other parts of the universe, it is quite possible that the water in which Saté bathed, which was certainly very nicely scented, was Ganges water."
