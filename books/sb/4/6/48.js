    "translation": "My dear lord, if in some places materialists, who are already bewildered by the insurmountable illusory energy of the Supreme Godhead, sometimes commit offenses, a saintly person, with compassion, does not take this seriously. Knowing that they commit offenses because they are overpowered by the illusory energy, he does not show his prowess to counteract them.",

            "content": "It is said that the beauty of a tapasvé, or saintly person, is forgiveness. There are many instances in the spiritual history of the world in which many saintly persons, although unnecessarily harassed, did not take action, although they could have done so. Parékñit Mahäräja, for example, was unnecessarily cursed by a brähmaëa boy, and this was very much regretted by the boy's father, but Parékñit Mahäräja accepted the curse and agreed to die within a week as the brähmaëa boy desired. Parékñit Mahäräja was the emperor and was full in power both spiritually and materially, but out of compassion and out of respect for the brähmaëa community, he did not counteract the action of the brähmaëa boy but agreed to die within seven days. Because it was desired by Kåñëa that Parékñit Mahäräja agree to the punishment so that the instruction of Çrémad-Bhägavatam would thus be revealed to the world, Parékñit Mahäräja was advised not to take action. A Vaiñëava is personally tolerant for the benefit of others. When he does not show his prowess, this does not mean that he is lacking in strength; rather, it indicates that he is tolerant for the welfare of the entire human society."
