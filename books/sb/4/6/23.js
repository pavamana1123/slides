Therefore the region of Alakä referred to here is different from the Alakä-puré of Kuvera. According to Véraräghava Äcärya, alakä means \"uncommonly beautiful.\" In the region of Alakä the demigods saw, there is a type of lotus flower known as Saugandhika that distributes an especially fragrant scent."
