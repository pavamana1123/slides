Except for a few persons in Kåñëa consciousness, the entire world is full of such envious persons, who are perpetually full of anxieties because they are attached to the material body and are without self-realization. Since their hearts are always filled with anxiety, it is understood that they have already been killed by providence. Thus Lord Çiva, as a self-realized Vaiñëava, was advised not to kill Dakña. A Vaiñëava is described as para-duùkha-duùkhé because although he is never distressed in any condition of life, he is distressed to see others in a distressed condition. Vaiñëavas, therefore, should not try to kill by any action of the body or mind, but should try to revive the Kåñëa consciousness of others out of compassion for them. The Kåñëa consciousness movement has been started to deliver the envious persons of the world from the clutches of mäyä, and even though devotees are sometimes put into trouble, they push on the Kåñëa consciousness movement in all tolerance. Lord Caitanya advises:"
