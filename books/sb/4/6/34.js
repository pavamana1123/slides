            "content": "The personalities sitting with Lord Çiva are significant because the four Kumäras were liberated from birth. It may be remembered that after their birth these Kumäras were requested by their father to get married and beget children in order to increase the population of the newly created universe. But they refused, and at that time Lord Brahmä was angry. In that angry mood, Rudra, or Lord Çiva, was born. Thus they were intimately related. Kuvera, the treasurer of the demigods, is fabulously rich. Thus Lord Çiva's association with the Kumäras and Kuvera indicates that he has all transcendental and material opulences. Actually, he is the qualitative incarnation of the Supreme Lord; therefore his position is very exalted."
