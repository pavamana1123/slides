            "content": "In this verse the word mahä-yogamaye is very significant. Yoga means meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and mahä-yoga means those who engage in the devotional service of Viñëu. Meditation means remembering, smaraëam. There are nine different kinds of devotional service, of which smaraëam is one process; the yogé remembers the form of Viñëu within his heart. Thus there were many devotees engaged in meditation on Lord Viñëu under the big banyan tree."

            "content": "The Sanskrit word mahä is derived from the affix mahat. This affix is used when there is a great number or quantity, so mahä-yoga indicates that there were many great yogés and devotees meditating on the form of Lord Viñëu. Generally such meditators are desirous of liberation from material bondage, and they are promoted to the spiritual world, to one of the Vaikuëöhas. Liberation means freedom from material bondage or nescience. In the material world we are suffering life after life because of our bodily identification, and liberation is freedom from that miserable condition of life."
