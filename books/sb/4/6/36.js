Lord Çiva is certainly the number one Vaiñëava, but he exhibits a feature for a particular class of men who cannot follow the Vaiñëava principles. The Çaivites, the devotees of Lord Çiva, generally dress like Lord Çiva, and sometimes they indulge in smoking and taking intoxicants. Such practices are never accepted by the followers of Vaiñëava rituals."
