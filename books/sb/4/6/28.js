It appears from these verses that Kailäsa is situated near the residential quarters of Kuvera. It is also stated here that the forest was full of desire trees. In Brahma-saàhitä we learn about the desire tree which is found in the spiritual world, especially in Kåñëaloka, the abode of Lord Kåñëa. We learn here that such desire trees are also found in Kailäsa, the residence of Lord Çiva, by the grace of Kåñëa. It thus appears that Kailäsa has a special significance; it is almost like the residence of Lord Kåñëa."
