He could understand the great fortune of his wife Sunéti and the great misfortune of Queen Suruci, for these facts were certainly very open in the palace. But still when the news reached the palace that Dhruva Mahäräja was returning, his mother, Sunéti, out of her great compassion and due to being the mother of a great Vaiñëava, did not hesitate to take the other wife, Suruci, and her son, Uttama, on the same palanquin. That was the greatness of Queen Sunéti, the mother of the great Vaiñëava Dhruva Mahäräja."
