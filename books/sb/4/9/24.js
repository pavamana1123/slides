            "content": "The most important factor in this verse is the Lord's instructions regarding how to remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead at the end of life. Ante näräyaëa-småtiù:  the result of whatever we do in executing spiritual activities is successful if we can remember Näräyaëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This program of constant remembrance can be disturbed by many things, but Dhruva Mahäräja's life would be so pure, as assured by the Lord Himself, that Dhruva would never forget Him. Thus at the time of his death he would remember the Supreme Lord, and before his death he would enjoy this material world, not by sense gratification, but by performing great sacrifices. As stated in the Vedas, when one performs great sacrifices he must give charity, not only to the brähmaëas, but also to the kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras. It is assured here that Dhruva Mahäräja would be able to perform such activities. In this age of Kali, however, the great sacrifice is the performance of saìkértana-yajïa. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is designed to teach people (and to learn ourselves) the exact instruction of the Personality of Godhead. In this way we shall continuously perform the saìkértana-yajïa and continuously chant the Hare Kåñëa mantra. Then at the end of our lives we shall certainly be able to remember Kåñëa, and our program of life will be successful. In this age, distribution of prasäda has replaced distribution of money. No one has sufficient money to distribute, but if we distribute kåñëa-prasäda as far as possible, this is more valuable than the distribution of money."
