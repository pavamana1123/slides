He lies down on the lap of Çeña Näga, from His navel sprouts a golden lotus flower on a stem, and on that lotus Lord Brahmä is created. I can understand that You are the same Supreme Godhead. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",

Lord Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu was present before Dhruva Mahäräja, who could also understand the Lord's two other forms, namely Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Käraëodakaçäyé (Mahä) Viñëu.

Sometimes the atheists argue, \"How can a flower stem sprout from the navel of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu?\" They consider all the statements of the çästras to be stories. As a result of their inexperience in the Absolute Truth and their reluctance to accept authority, they become more and more atheistic; they cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But a devotee like Dhruva Mahäräja, by the grace of the Lord, knows all the manifestations of the Lord and their different positions. It is said that anyone who has even a little of the Lord's grace can understand His glories; others may go on speculating on the Absolute Truth, but they will always be unable to understand the Lord. In other words, unless one comes in contact with a devotee it is not possible to understand the transcendental form or the spiritual world and its transcendental activities."
