In this verse it has been especially mentioned that the tears which flowed down from the eyes of Sunéti were all-auspicious. This auspiciousness of the abhiñeka ceremony performed by his beloved mother was an indication that in the very near future Dhruva Mahäräja would be installed on the throne of his father. The history of Dhruva Mahäräja's leaving home was that his father refused to give him a place on his lap, and Dhruva Mahäräja determined that unless he got the throne of his father he would not come back. Now this abhiñeka ceremony performed by his beloved mother was an indication that he would occupy the throne of Mahäräja Uttänapäda."

            "content": "It is also significant in this verse that Sunéti, mother of Dhruva Mahäräja, is described as véra-sü, a mother who produced a great hero. There are many heroes in the world, but there is no comparison to Dhruva Mahäräja, who was not only a heroic emperor of this planet, but also a great devotee. A devotee is also a great hero because he conquers the influence of mäyä. When Lord Caitanya inquired from Rämänanda Räya about the most famous man in this world, the latter replied that anyone who is known as a great devotee of the Lord is to be accepted as the most famous."
