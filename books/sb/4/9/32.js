    "translation": "Since all the demigods who are situated in the higher planetary system will have to come down again, they are all envious of my being elevated to Vaikuëöhaloka by devotional service. These intolerant demigods have dissipated my intelligence, and only for this reason could I not accept the genuine benediction of the instructions of Sage Närada.",

It is known to them that their position in the higher planetary system is impermanent, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, Ninth Chapter (kñéëe puëye martya-lokaà viçanti). It is said in the Gétä that after exhausting the results of their pious activities, all the demigods, who are inhabitants of the higher planetary system, have to come back again to this earth."

Everything is controlled by them. Dhruva Mahäräja's conclusion is that these demigods, being envious of his superior position in devotional service, conspired against him to pollute his intelligence, and thus although he was the disciple of a great Vaiñëava, Närada Muni, he could not accept Närada's valid instructions. Now Dhruva Mahäräja regretted very much that he had neglected these instructions. Närada Muni had asked him, \"Why should you bother about insult or adoration from your stepmother?\" He of course said to Dhruva Mahäräja that since Dhruva was only a child, what did he have to do with such insult or adoration? But Dhruva Mahäräja was determined to achieve the benediction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore Närada advised him to go back home for the time being, and in mature time he could try to practice devotional service. Dhruva Mahäräja regretted that he had rejected the advice of Närada Muni and was adamant in asking him for something perishable, namely revenge against his stepmother for her insult, and possession of the kingdom of his father."

Still, the Lord is so merciful that due to Dhruva's execution of devotional service He offered Dhruva the ultimate Vaiñëava goal."
