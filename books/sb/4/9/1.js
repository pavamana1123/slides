    "translation": "The great sage Maitreya told Vidura: When the demigods were thus reassured by the Personality of Godhead, they were freed from all fears, and after offering their obeisances, they returned to their heavenly planets. Then the Lord, who is nondifferent from the Sahasraçérñä incarnation, got on the back of Garuòa, who carried Him to the Madhuvana Forest to see His servant Dhruva.",

Although the Lord appeared as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, He has been described here as Sahasraçérñä Viñëu because He is nondifferent from Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu. According to Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé in his Bhägavatämåta, the Sahasraçérñä Personality of Godhead who appeared at that time was the incarnation known as Påçnigarbha. He created the planet known as Dhruvaloka for the habitation of Dhruva Mahäräja."
