            "content": "The word anätmyam is very significant in this. verse. Ätmä means \"the soul,\" and anätmya means \"without any conception of the soul.\" Çréla Åñabhadeva instructed his sons that unless a human being comes to the point of understanding the ätmä, or spiritual position, whatever he does is ignorance, and this brings only defeat in his life. Dhruva Mahäräja regrets his unfortunate position, for although he approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is always able to give His devotee the highest benediction of cessation of the repetition of birth and death, which is impossible for any demigod to offer, he foolishly wanted something perishable. When Hiraëyakaçipu asked immortality from Lord Brahmä, Lord Brahmä expressed his inability to offer such a benediction because he himself is not immortal; therefore immortality, or complete cessation of the chain of repeated birth and death, can be offered by the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead Himself, not by others. Harià vinä na måtim taranti. It is said that without the blessings of Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no one can stop the continuous chain of birth and death within this material world. Therefore the Supreme Lord is also called bhava-cchit. The Vaiñëava philosophy in the process of Kåñëa consciousness prohibits the devotee from all kinds of material aspirations. A Vaiñëava devotee should always be anyäbhiläñitä-çünya, free from all material aspirations for the results of fruitive activities or empiric philosophical speculation. Dhruva Mahäräja was actually initiated by Närada Muni, the greatest Vaiñëava, in the chanting of oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya. This mantra is a viñëu-mantra, for by practicing the chanting of this mantra one is elevated to the Viñëuloka. Dhruva Mahäräja regrets that although he was initiated in the viñëu-mantra by a Vaiñëava, he still aspired for material benefits. That was another cause for lamentation. Although he got the result of the viñëu-mantra by the causeless mercy of the Lord, he lamented how foolish he was to have strived for material benefits while practicing devotional service. In other words, every one of us who is engaged in devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness should be completely free from all material aspirations. Otherwise we will have to lament like Dhruva Mahäräja."
