    "translation": "Çré Vidura inquired: My dear brähmaëa, the abode of the Lord is very difficult to attain. It can be attained only by pure devotional service, which alone pleases the most affectionate, merciful Lord. Dhruva Mahäräja achieved this position even in one life, and he was very wise and conscientious. Why, then, was he not very pleased?",

            "content": "Saint Vidura's inquiry is very relevant. The word artha-vit, which refers to one who knows how to discriminate between reality and unreality, is very significant in this connection. An artha-vit is also called paramahaàsa. A paramahaàsa accepts only the active principle of everything; just as a swan accepts only the milk from a mixture of water and milk, a paramahaàsa accepts only the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his life and soul, neglecting all external, material things. Dhruva Mahäräja was in this category, and due to his determination he achieved, the result he desired, but still when he returned home he was not very pleased."
