Then the King installed him on the throne to take charge of the affairs of the world."

            "content": "When a Vaiñëava king like Dhruva Mahäräja is the head of the government of the entire world, the world is so happy that it is not possible to imagine or describe. Even now, if people would all become Kåñëa conscious, the democratic government of the present day would be exactly like the kingdom of heaven. If all people became Kåñëa conscious they would vote for persons of the category of Dhruva Mahäräja. If the post of chief executive were occupied by such a Vaiñëava, all the problems of satanic government would be solved. The youthful generation of the present day is very enthusiastic in trying to overthrow the government in different parts of the world. But unless people are Kåñëa conscious like Dhruva Mahäräja, there will be no appreciable changes in government because people who hanker to attain political position by hook or by crook cannot think of the welfare of the people. They are only busy to keep their position of prestige and monetary gain. They have very little time to think of the welfare of the citizens."
