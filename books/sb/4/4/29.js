Ätmya means \"the life of the soul,\" so this word indicates that although Dakña appeared to be living, actually he was a dead body, otherwise how could he neglect Saté, who was his own daughter? It was the duty of Dakña to look after the maintenance and comforts of all living entities because he was situated as Prajäpati, the governor of all living entities. Therefore how is it that he neglected his own daughter, who was the most exalted and chaste woman, a great soul, and who therefore deserved the most respectful treatment from her father? The death of Saté because of her being neglected by Dakña, her father, was most astonishing to all the great demigods of the universe."
