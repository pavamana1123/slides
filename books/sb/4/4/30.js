            "content": "Dakña is described here as most hardhearted and therefore unqualified to be a brähmaëa. Brahma-dhruk is described by some commentators to mean brahma-bandhu, or friend of the brähmaëas. A person who is born in a brähmaëa family but has no brahminical qualifications is called a brahma-bandhu. Brähmaëas are generally very softhearted and forbearing because they have the power to control the senses and the mind. Dakña, however, was not forbearing. For the simple reason that his son-in-law, Lord Çiva, did not stand up to show him the formality of respect, he became so angry and hardhearted that he tolerated even the death of his dearest daughter. Saté tried her best to mitigate the misunderstanding between the son-in-law and the father-in-law by coming to her father's house, even without an invitation, and at that time Dakña should have received her, forgetting all past misunderstandings. But he was so hardhearted that he was unworthy to be called an Äryan or brähmaëa. Thus his ill fame still continues. Dakña means \"expert,\" and he was given this name because of his ability to beget many hundreds and thousands of children. Persons who are too sexually inclined and materialistic become so hardhearted because of a slight loss of prestige that they can tolerate even the death of their children."
