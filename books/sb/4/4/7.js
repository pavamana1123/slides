    "translation": "When Saté, with her followers, reached the arena, because all the people assembled were afraid of Dakña, none of them received her well. No one welcomed her but her mother and sisters, who, with tears in their eyes and with glad faces, welcomed her and talked with her very pleasingly.",

Due to natural affection, they immediately embraced her with tears in their eyes and with loving feelings. This shows that women as a class are very softhearted; their natural affection and love cannot be checked by artificial means. Although the men present were very learned brähmaëas and demigods, they were afraid of their superior, Dakña, and because they knew that their welcoming Saté would displease him, although in their minds they wanted to receive her, they could not do so. Women are naturally softhearted, but men are sometimes very hardhearted."
