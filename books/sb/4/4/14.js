    "translation": "Saté continued: My dear father, you are committing the greatest offense by envying Lord Çiva, whose very name, consisting of two syllables, çi and va, purifies one of all sinful activities. His order is never neglected. Lord Çiva is always pure, and no one but you envies him.",

            "content": "Since Lord Çiva is the greatest soul among the living entities within this material world, his name, Çiva, is very auspicious for persons who identify the body with the soul. If such persons take shelter of Lord Çiva, gradually they will understand that they are not the material body but are spirit soul. Çiva means maìgala, or auspicious. Within the body the soul is auspicious. Ahaà brahmäsmi: \"I am Brahman.\" This realization is auspicious. As long as one does not realize his identity as the soul, whatever he does is inauspicious. Çiva means \"auspicious,\" and devotees of Lord Çiva gradually come to the platform of spiritual identification, but that is not all. Auspicious life begins from the point of spiritual identification. But there are still more duties—one has to understand one's relationship with the Supreme Soul. If one is actually a devotee of Lord Çiva, he comes to the platform of spiritual realization, but if he is not intelligent enough, then he stops at that point, only realizing that he is spirit soul (ahaà brahmäsmi). If he is intelligent enough, however, he should continue to act in the way of Lord Çiva, for Lord Çiva is always absorbed in the thought of Väsudeva. As previously explained, sattvaà viçuddhaà vasudeva-çabditam: Lord Çiva is always in meditation on the lotus feet of Väsudeva, Çré Kåñëa. Thus the auspicious position of Lord Çiva is realized if one takes to the worship of Viñëu, because Lord Çiva says in the Çiva Puräëa that the topmost worship is worship of Lord Viñëu. Lord Çiva is worshiped because he is the greatest devotee of Lord Viñëu. One should not, however, make the mistake of considering Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu to be on the same level. That is also an atheistic idea. It is also enjoined in the Vaiñëavéya Puräëa that Viñëu, or Näräyaëa, is the exalted Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one should be compared to Him as equal, even Lord Çiva or Lord Brahmä, not to speak of other demigods."
