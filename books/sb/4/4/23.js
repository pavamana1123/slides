    "translation": "Because of our family relationship, when Lord Çiva addresses me as Däkñäyaëé I at once become morose, and my jolliness and my smile at once disappear. I feel very much sorry that my body, which is just like a bag, has been produced by you. I shall therefore give it up.",

Dakña was the embodiment of envy, for he unnecessarily blasphemed a great personality, Lord Çiva. Simply upon hearing the word däkñäyaëé, she felt afflicted because of reference to the context because her body was the symbol of all the offensiveness with which Dakña was endowed. Since her body was constantly a source of unhappiness, she decided to give it up."
