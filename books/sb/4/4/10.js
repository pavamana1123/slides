    "translation": "The followers of Lord Çiva, the ghosts, were ready to injure or kill Dakña, but Saté stopped them by her order. She was very angry and sorrowful, and in that mood she began to condemn the process of sacrificial fruitive activities and persons who are very proud of such unnecessary and troublesome sacrifices. She especially condemned her father, speaking against him in the presence of all.",

            "content": "The process of offering sacrifices is especially meant to satisfy Viñëu, who is called Yajïeça because He is the enjoyer of the fruits of all sacrifice. Bhagavad-gétä  also confirms this fact. The Lord says, bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäm. He is the actual beneficiary of all sacrifices. Not knowing this fact, less intelligent men offer sacrifices for some material benefit. To derive personal material benefits for sense gratification is the reason persons like Dakña and his followers perform sacrifices. Such sacrifices are condemned here as a labor of love without actual profit. This is confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. One may prosecute the Vedic injunctions of offering sacrifices and other fruitive activities, but if by such activities one does not develop attraction for Viñëu, they are useless labors. One who has developed love for Viñëu must develop love and respect for Viñëu's devotees. Lord Çiva is considered the foremost personality amongst the Vaiñëavas. Vaiñëavänäà yathä çambhuù. Thus when Saté saw that her father was performing great sacrifices but had no respect for the greatest devotee, Lord Çiva, she was very angry. This is fitting; when Viñëu or a Vaiñëava is insulted, one should be angry. Lord Caitanya, who always preached nonviolence, meekness and humility, also became angry when Nityänanda was offended by Jagäi and Mädhäi, and He wanted to kill them. When Viñëu or a Vaiñëava is blasphemed or dishonored, one should be very angry. Narottama däsa Öhäkura said, krodha bhakta-dveñi jane. We have anger, and that anger can be a great quality when directed against a person who is envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee. One should not be tolerant when a person is offensive towards Viñëu or a Vaiñëava. The anger of Saté towards her father was not objectionable, for although he was her father, he was trying to insult the greatest Vaiñëava. Thus Saté's anger against her father was quite applaudable."
