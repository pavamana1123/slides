    "translation": "When the Åbhu demigods attacked the ghosts and Guhyakas with half-burned fuel from the yajïa fire, all these attendants of Saté fled in different directions and disappeared. This was possible simply because of brahma-tejas, brahminical power.",

In those days, brähmaëas were so powerful that simply by desiring and by chanting a Vedic mantra, they could accomplish very wonderful effects. But in the present age of degradation there are no such brähmaëas. According to the päïcarätrika system, in this age the entire population is supposed to consist of çüdras because the brahminical culture has been lost. But if anyone displays the signs of understanding Kåñëa consciousness, he should be accepted, according to Vaiñëava småti regulations, as a prospective brähmaëa and should be given all facilities to achieve the highest perfection. The most magnanimous gift of Lord Caitanya's is that the highest perfection of life is available in this fallen age if one simply adopts the process of chanting Hare Kåñëa, which is able to bring about the fulfillment of all activities in self-realization."
