    "translation": "Saté felt very sorry at being forbidden to go see her relatives at her father's house, and due to affection for them, tears fell from her eyes. Shaking and very much afflicted, she looked at her uncommon husband, Lord Çiva, as if she were going to blast him with her vision.",

            "content": "The word apratipüruñam, used in this verse, means \"one who has no equal.\" Lord Çiva has no equal in the material world in regard to equality towards everyone. His wife, Saté, knew that her husband was equal towards everyone, so why in this case was he so unkind to his wife that he did not allow her to go to her father's house? This distressed her more than she could tolerate, and she looked at her husband as if she were ready to blast him with her vision. In other words, since Lord Çiva is the ätmä (çiva also means ätmä), it is indicated here that Saté was prepared to commit suicide. Another meaning of the word apratipüruña is \"the personality who has no rival.\" Since Lord Çiva could not be persuaded to give her permission, Saté took shelter of a woman's last weapon, weeping, which forces a husband to agree to the proposal of his wife."
