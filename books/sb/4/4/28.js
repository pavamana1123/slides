            "content": "There was a tumultuous roaring all over the universe in the societies of the demigods of different planets because Saté was the daughter of Dakña, the greatest of all kings, and the wife of Lord Çiva, the greatest of all demigods. Why did she become so angry that she gave up her body? Since she was the daughter of a great personality and wife of a great personality, she had nothing to desire, but still she gave up her body in dissatisfaction. Certainly this was astonishing. One cannot attain complete satisfaction even if one is situated in the greatest material opulence. There was nothing Saté could not achieve either from her relationship with her father or from her relationship with the greatest of the demigods, but still, for some reason, she was dissatisfied. Therefore, Çrémad-Bhägavatam  explains that one has to achieve real satisfaction (yayätmä suprasédati), but ätmä—the body, mind and soul—all become completely satisfied only if one develops devotional service to the Absolute Truth. Sa vai puàsäà paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokñaje. Adhokñaja means the Absolute Truth. If one can develop his unflinching love for the transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead, that can give complete satisfaction, otherwise there is no possibility of satisfaction in the material world or anywhere else."
