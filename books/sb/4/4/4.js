The word gata-vyathäù, used in this connection, means \"without fear.\" Saté did not care that she was going alone; therefore she was almost fearless. The word anucaräù is also significant, for it indicates that Lord Çiva's disciples were always ready to sacrifice anything for Lord Çiva. All of them could understand the desire of Çiva, who did not want Saté to go alone. Anucaräù means \"those who can immediately understand the purpose of their master.\""
