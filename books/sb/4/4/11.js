Therefore he is equal to everyone; no one is his enemy, and no one is his friend, but one who is envious by nature can become the enemy of Lord Çiva. Therefore Saté accused her father, \"No one but you could be envious of Lord Çiva or be his enemy.\" Other sages and learned brähmaëas were present, but they were not envious of Lord Çiva, although they were all dependent on Dakña. Therefore no one but Dakña could be envious of Lord Çiva. That was the accusation of Saté."
