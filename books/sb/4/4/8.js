Saté was the youngest child of Dakña, and she knew that she was his pet. But now, because of her association with Lord Çiva, Dakña forgot all his affection for his daughter, and this very much aggrieved her. The material bodily conception is so polluted that even upon slight provocation all our relationships of love and affection are nullified. Bodily relationships are so transient that even though one is affectionate towards someone in a bodily relationship, a slight provocation terminates this intimacy."
