    "translation": "Present in the arena of sacrifice, Saté saw that there were no oblations for her husband, Lord Çiva. Next she realized that not only had her father failed to invite Lord Çiva, but when he saw Lord Çiva's exalted wife, Dakña did not receive her either. Thus she became greatly angry, so much so that she looked at her father as if she were going to burn him with her eyes.",

            "content": "By offering oblations in the fire while chanting the Vedic mantra svähä, one offers respect to all the demigods, great sages and Pitäs, including Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu. It is customary that Çiva is one of those who are offered respects, but Saté, while personally present in the arena, saw that the brähmaëas did not utter the mantra offering oblations to Lord Çiva, namaù çiväya svähä. She was not sorry for herself, for she was ready to come to her father's house without being invited, but she wanted to see whether or not her husband was being respected. To see her relatives, her sisters and mother, was not so important; even when she was received by her mother and sisters she did not care, for she was most concerned that her husband was being insulted in the sacrifice. When she marked the insult, she became greatly angry, and she looked at her father so angrily that Dakña appeared to burn in her vision."
