In the previous verses, Saté has described that Lord Çiva is always in a transcendental position because he is situated in pure vasudeva. Vasudeva is that state from which Kåñëa, Väsudeva, is born, so Lord Çiva is the greatest devotee of Lord Kåñëa, and Saté's behavior is exemplary because no one should tolerate blasphemy against Lord Viñëu or His devotee. Saté is aggrieved not for her personal association with Lord Çiva but because her body is related with that of Dakña, who is an offender at Lord Çiva's lotus feet. She feels herself to be condemned because of the body given by her father, Dakña."
