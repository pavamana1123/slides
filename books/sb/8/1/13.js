    "translation": "The entire cosmic manifestation is the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, who has millions of names and unlimited potencies. He is self-effulgent, unborn and changeless. He is the beginning of everything, but He has no beginning. Because He has created this cosmic manifestation by His external energy, the universe appears to be created, maintained and annihilated by Him. Nonetheless, He remains inactive in His spiritual energy and is untouched by the activities of the material energy.",

This is spiritual existence. By chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, consisting of names of the Supreme Lord, we find that the name has all the potencies of the person. The Lord's activities are many, and according to His activities He has many names. He appeared as the son of mother Yaçodä, and also as the son of mother Devaké, and therefore He is named Devaké-nandana and Yaçodä-nandana. Paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate:  the Lord has a multitude of energies, and therefore He acts in multifarious ways. Yet He has a particular name. The çästras recommend which names we should chant, such as Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare. It is not that we have to search for some name or manufacture one. Rather, we must follow the saintly persons and the çästras in chanting His holy name."

            "content": "Although the material and spiritual energies both belong to the Lord, He is impossible to understand as long as we are in the material energy. And when we come to the spiritual energy, He is very easy to know. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam ), and to understand the Lord one must take to this path of devotional service. Even though the people of the world have forgotten God and may say that God is dead, this is not a fact. One can understand God when one takes to the Kåñëa consciousness movement, and thus one can be happy."
