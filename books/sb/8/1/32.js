We have published many books, including Çré Caitanya-caritämåta in seventeen volumes, four hundred pages each, as well as Bhagavad-gétä and The Nectar of Devotion. We are also publishing Çrémad-Bhägavatam in sixty volumes. Wherever a speaker holds discourses from these books and an audience hears him, this will create a good and auspicious situation. Therefore the preaching of Kåñëa consciousness must be done very carefully by the members of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, especially the sannyäsés. This will create an auspicious atmosphere."
