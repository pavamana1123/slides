    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is full in opulence by His own gain, yet He acts as the creator, maintainer and annihilator of this material world. In spite of acting in that way, He is never entangled. Hence devotees who follow in His footsteps are also never entangled.",

Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\" The living entities are actually minute forms who are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is full in everything, and the small particles of the Lord are also originally qualified like Him, but because of their minute existence, they are infected by material attraction and thus entangled. We must therefore follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and then, like Kåñëa, who is never entangled by His material activities of creation, maintenance and annihilation, we will have nothing for which to lament (nävasédanti ye 'nu tam). Kåñëa personally gives instructions in Bhagavad-gétä, and anyone who follows these instructions is liberated."

Man-manä bhava mad-bhakto mad-yäjé mäà namaskuru: \"Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me.\"  Always thinking of Kåñëa means chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra, but unless one is an initiated devotee he cannot do this. As soon as one becomes a devotee, he engages in Deity worship (mad-yäjé). A devotee's business is to offer obeisances to the Lord and the spiritual master constantly. This principle is the recognized way to come to the platform of bhakti. As soon as one comes to this platform, he gradually understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and simply by understanding Kåñëa one is liberated from material bondage."
