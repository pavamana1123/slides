    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no beginning, no end and no middle. Nor does He belong to a particular person or nation. He has no inside or outside. The dualities found within this material world, such as beginning and end, mine and theirs, are all absent from the personality of the Supreme Lord. The universe, which emanates from Him, is another feature of the Lord. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the ultimate truth, and He is complete in greatness.",

He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes.\" For the Lord's existence there is no cause, for He is the cause of everything. He is in everything (mayä tatam idaà sarvam ), He is expanded in everything, but He is not everything. He is acintya-bhedäbheda, simultaneously one and different. That is explained in this verse. In the material condition we have a conception of beginning, end and middle, but for the Supreme Personality of Godhead there are no such things. The universal cosmic manifestation is also the viräö-rüpa that was shown to Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä. Therefore, since the Lord is present everywhere and all the time, He is the Absolute Truth and the greatest. He is complete in greatness. God is great, and how He is great is explained here."
