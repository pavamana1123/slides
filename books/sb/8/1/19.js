Manu, the manu-puträù (the sons of Manu), the king of the heavenly planets, and the seven great sages are all partial incarnations of the Supreme Lord. Manu himself, his sons Priyavrata and Uttänapäda, the demigods created by Dakña, and the åñis like Maréci were all partial incarnations of the Lord during the reign of Sväyambhuva Manu. During that time, the incarnation of the Lord as Yajïa took charge of ruling the heavenly planets. The next Manu was Svärociña. The Manus and the sages and demigods are further described in the following eleven verses."
