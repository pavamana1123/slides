Sometime in the year 1935 when His Divine Grace was staying at Rädhä-kuëòa, I went to see him from Bombay. At that time, he gave me many important instructions in regard to constructing temples and publishing books. He personally told me that publishing books is more important than constructing temples. Of course, those same instructions remained within my mind for many years. In 1944 I began publishing my Back to Godhead, and when I retired from family life in 1958 I began publishing Çrémad-Bhägavatam in Delhi. When three parts of Çrémad-Bhägavatam had been published in India, I then started for the United States of America on the thirteenth of August, 1965."

            "content": "I am continuously trying to publish books, as suggested by my spiritual master. Now, in this year, 1976, I have completed the Seventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and a summary of the Tenth Canto has already been published as Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Still, the Eighth Canto, Ninth Canto, Tenth Canto, Eleventh Canto and Twelfth Canto are yet to be published. On this occasion, therefore, I am praying to my spiritual master to give me strength to finish this work. I am neither a great scholar nor a great devotee; I am simply a humble servant of my spiritual master, and to the best of my ability I am trying to please him by publishing these books, with the cooperation of my disciples in America. Fortunately, scholars all over the world are appreciating these publications. Let us cooperatively publish more and more volumes of Çrémad-Bhägavatam just to please His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura."

            "content": "This First Chapter of the Eighth Canto may be summarized as a description of four Manus, namely Sväyambhuva, Svärociña, Uttama and Tämasa. After hearing descriptions of the dynasty of Sväyambhuva Manu until the end of the Seventh Canto, Mahäräja Parékñit desired to know about other Manus. He desired to understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends—not only in the past but at the present and in the future—and how He acts in various pastimes as Manu. Since Parékñit Mahäräja was eager to know all this, Çukadeva Gosvämé gradually described all the Manus, beginning with the six Manus who had appeared in the past."

            "content": "The first Manu was Sväyambhuva Manu. His two daughters, namely Äküti and Devahüti, gave birth to two sons, named Yajïa and Kapila respectively. Because Çukadeva Gosvämé had already described the activities of Kapila in the Third Canto, he now described the activities of Yajïa. The original Manu, along with his wife, Çatarüpä, went into the forest to practice austerities on the bank of the River Sunandä. They practiced austerities for a hundred years, and then Manu, in a trance, formed prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Räkñasas and asuras then attempted to devour him, but Yajïa, accompanied by his sons the Yämas and the demigods, killed them. Then Yajïa personally took the post of Indra, the King of the heavenly planets."

In the age of this Manu, Rocana became Indra, the ruler of the heavenly planets, and there were many demigods, headed by Tuñita. There were also many saintly persons, such as Ürja and Stambha. Among them was Vedaçirä, whose wife, Tuñitä, gave birth to Vibhu. Vibhu instructed eighty-eight thousand dåòha-vratas, or saintly persons, on self-control and austerity."

During the reign of this Manu, the sons of Vasiñöha, headed by Pramada, became the seven saintly persons. The Satyas, Devaçrutas and Bhadras became the demigods, and Satyajit became Indra. From the womb of Sunåtä, the wife of Dharma, the Lord appeared as Satyasena, and He killed all the Yakñas and Räkñasas who were fighting with Satyajit."

During his reign, the Satyakas, Haris, Véras and others were demigods, the seven great saints were headed by Jyotirdhäma, and Triçikha became Indra. Harimedhä begot a son named Hari in the womb of his wife Hariëé. This Hari, an incarnation of God, saved the devotee Gajendra. This incident is described as gajendra-mokñaëa. At the end of this chapter, Parékñit Mahäräja particularly asks about this incident."
