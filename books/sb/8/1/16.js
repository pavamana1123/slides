He is full in knowledge, free from material desires and diversions, and completely independent. As the supreme teacher of human society, He teaches His own way of activities, and thus He inaugurates the real path of religion. I request everyone to follow Him.",

Follow the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, and your life will be successful. That is the summary of the Kåñëa consciousness movement. The organizer of the Kåñëa consciousness movement is teaching everyone how to follow Lord Rämacandra, how to follow Lord Kåñëa, and how to follow Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. In this material world, we need a leader for a monarchy or good government. Lord Çré Rämacandra, by His practical example, showed how to live for the benefit of all human society. He fought with demons like Rävaëa, He carried out the orders of His father, and He remained the faithful husband of mother Sétä. Thus there is no comparison to Lord Rämacandra's acting as an ideal king. Indeed, people still hanker for räma-räjya, a government conducted like that of Lord Rämacandra. Similarly, although Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He taught His disciple and devotee Arjuna how to lead a life ending in going back home, back to Godhead (tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti mäm eti so 'rjuna ). All teachings—political, economic, social, religious, cultural and philosophical—are to be found in Bhagavad-gétä. One only has to follow them strictly. The Supreme Personality of Godhead also comes as Lord Caitanya just to play the part of a pure devotee. Thus the Lord teaches us in different ways just to make our lives successful, and Sväyambhuva Manu requests us to follow Him."

Let me surrender unto His lotus feet.\" (Caitanya-candrodaya-näöaka 6.74) In this age of Kali, people cannot follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore the Lord Himself takes the part of Çré Kåñëa Caitanya to teach personally how to become Kåñëa conscious. He asks everyone to follow Him and to become a guru to deliver the fallen souls of Kali-yuga."
