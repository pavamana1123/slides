            "content": "\"While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor the dead.\" Thus as Kåñëa challenged Arjuna by saying that he was not a paëòita, or a learned person, Bali Mahäräja also challenged King Indra and his associates. In this material world, everything happens under the influence of time. Consequently, for a learned person who sees how things are taking place, there is no question of being sorry or happy because of the waves of material nature. After all, since we are being carried away by these waves, what is the meaning of being jubilant or morose? One who is fully conversant with the laws of nature is never jubilant or morose because of nature's activities. In Bhagavad-gétä , brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä na çocati na käìkñati: \"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.\" When one is undisturbed by material circumstances, he should be understood to be on the transcendental stage, above the reactions of the three modes of material nature."
