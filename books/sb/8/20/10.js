Aside from this, if a benevolent and merciful person exhibits his pride in becoming poverty-stricken by giving his possessions in charity for good causes, his poverty is a welcome and auspicious sign of a great personality. Bali Mahäräja decided that even though he would become poverty-stricken by giving everything to Vämanadeva, this is what he would prefer."
