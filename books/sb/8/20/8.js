    "translation": "O best of the brähmaëas, certainly the great demoniac kings who were never reluctant to fight enjoyed this world, but in due course of time everything they had was taken away, except their reputation, by which they continue to exist. In other words, one should try to achieve a good reputation instead of anything else.",

The duration of one's life is extremely short, but if in that short lifetime one can do something that enhances his good reputation, that may continue to exist for many millions of years. Bali Mahäräja therefore decided not to follow his spiritual master's instruction that he deny his promise to Vämanadeva; instead, he decided to give the land according to the promise and be everlastingly celebrated as one of the twelve mahäjanas (balir vaiyäsakir vayam)."
