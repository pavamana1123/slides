Thus Çukräcärya was never inspired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to develop in devotional service. As stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä :"

            "content": "Devotees who actually engage in devotional service with faith and love are inspired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vaiñëavas are never concerned with ritualistic smärta-brähmaëas. Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé has therefore compiled Hari-bhakti-viläsa to guide the Vaiñëavas, who never follow the smärta-viddhi. Although the Supreme Lord is situated in the core of everyone's heart, unless one is a Vaiñëava, unless one is engaged in devotional service, one does not get sound advice by which to return home, back to Godhead. Such instructions are meant only for devotees. Therefore in this verse the word daiva-prahitaù, \"being inspired by the Supreme Lord,\" is important. Çukräcärya should have encouraged Bali Mahäräja to give everything to Lord Viñëu. This would have been a sign of love for the Supreme Lord. But he did not do so. On the contrary, he wanted to punish his devoted disciple by cursing him."
