It is the duty of such a sober personality as Bali Mahäräja to abide by the orders of his spiritual master immediately, as his spiritual master had advised. But Bali Mahäräja also considered that Çukräcärya was no longer to be accepted as a spiritual master, for he had deviated from the duty of a spiritual master. According to çästra, the duty of the guru is to take the disciple back home, back to Godhead. If he is unable to do so and instead hinders the disciple in going back to Godhead, he should not be a guru. Gurur na sa syät ). The spiritual master helps the disciple attain this stage by developing Kåñëa consciousness. Now Çukräcärya has advised Bali Mahäräja to deny the promise to Vämanadeva. Under the circumstances, therefore, Bali Mahäräja thought that there would be no fault if he disobeyed the order of his spiritual master. He deliberated on this point—should he refuse to accept the advice of his spiritual master, or should he independently do everything to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead? He took some time. Therefore it is said, tüñëéà bhütvä kñaëaà rajann uväcävahito gurum. After deliberating on this point, he decided that Lord Viñëu should be pleased in all circumstances, even at the risk of ignoring the guru's advice to the contrary."
