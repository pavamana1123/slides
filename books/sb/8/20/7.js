            "content": "Bali Mahäräja was prepared to give everything to Lord Viñëu, and Çukräcärya, being a professional priest, might have been anxiously waiting, doubting whether there had been any such instance in history in which one had given everything in charity. Bali Mahäräja, however, cited the tangible examples of Mahäräja Çibi and Mahäräja Dadhéci, who had given up their lives for the benefit of the general public. Certainly one has attachment for everything material, especially one's land, but land and other possessions are forcibly taken away at the time of death, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (måtyuù sarva-haraç cäham ). The Lord personally appeared to Bali Mahäräja to take away everything he had, and thus he was so fortunate that he could see the Lord face to face. Nondevotees, however, cannot see the Lord face to face; to such persons the Lord appears as death and takes away all their possessions by force. Under the circumstances, why should we not part with our possessions and deliver them to Lord Viñëu for His satisfaction? Çré Cäëakya Paëòita says in this regard, san-nimitte varaà tyägo vinäçe niyate sati (Cäëakya-çloka 36). Since our money and possessions do not last but will somehow or other be taken away, as long as they are in our possession it is better to use them for charity to a noble cause. Therefore Bali Mahäräja defied the order of his so-called spiritual master."
