But she feels very much overburdened when she carries even one person who is a liar. It is said that in Kali-yuga lying is a common affair: mäyaiva vyävahärike . Even in the most common dealings, people are accustomed to speaking so many lies. No one is free from the sinful reactions of speaking lies. Under the circumstances, one can just imagine how this has overburdened the earth, and indeed the entire universe."
