            "content": "Bali Mahäräja's grave answer to Çukräcärya is meaningful. Çukräcärya stressed that one's material means of livelihood and one's material reputation, sense gratification and economic development must continue properly. To see to this is the first duty of a man who is a householder, especially one who is interested in material affairs. If a religious principle does not affect one's material condition, it is to be accepted. At the present time, in this age of Kali, this idea is extremely prominent. No one is prepared to accept any religious principle if it hampers material prosperity. Çukräcärya, being a person of this material world, did not know the principles of a devotee. A devotee is determined to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His full satisfaction. Anything that hampers such determination should certainly be rejected. This is the principle of bhakti. Änukülyasya saìkalpaù prätikülyasya varjanam . To perform devotional service, one must accept only that which is favorable and reject that which is unfavorable. Bali Mahäräja had the opportunity to contribute everything he possessed to the lotus feet of Lord Vämanadeva, but Çukräcärya was putting forward a material argument to hamper this process of devotional service. Under the circumstances, Bali Mahäräja decided that such hindrances should certainly be avoided. In other words, he decided immediately to reject the advice of Çukräcärya and go on with his duty. Thus he gave all his possessions to Lord Vämanadeva."
