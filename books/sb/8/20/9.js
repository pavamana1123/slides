            "content": "\"That gift which is given out of duty, at the proper time and place, to a worthy person, and without expectation of return is considered to be charity in the mode of goodness.\" Thus charity given in the proper place is called sättvika. And above this charity in goodness is transcendental charity, in which everything is sacrificed for the sake of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vämanadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, had come to Bali Mahäräja for alms. How could one get such an opportunity to give charity? Therefore, Bali Mahäräja decided without hesitation to give the Lord whatever He wanted. One may get various opportunities to lay down his life on the battlefield, but such an opportunity as this is hardly ever obtained."
