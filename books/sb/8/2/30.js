    "translation": "Thereafter, because of being pulled into the water and fighting for many long years, the elephant became diminished in his mental, physical and sensual strength. The crocodile, on the contrary, being an animal of the water, increased in enthusiasm, physical strength and sensual power.",

            "content": "In the fighting between the elephant and the crocodile, the difference was that although the elephant was extremely powerful, he was in a foreign place, in the water. During one thousand years of fighting, he could not get any food, and under the circumstances his bodily strength diminished, and because his bodily strength diminished, his mind also became weak and his senses less powerful. The crocodile, however, being an animal of the water, had no difficulties. He was getting food and was therefore getting mental strength and sensual encouragement. Thus while the elephant became reduced in strength, the crocodile became more and more powerful. Now, from this we may take the lesson that in our fight with mäyä we should not be in a position in which our strength, enthusiasm and senses will be unable to fight vigorously. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement has actually declared war against the illusory energy, in which all the living entities are rotting in a false understanding of civilization. The soldiers in this Kåñëa consciousness movement must always possess physical strength, enthusiasm and sensual power. To keep themselves fit, they must therefore place themselves in a normal condition of life. What constitutes a normal condition will not be the same for everyone, and therefore there are divisions of varëäçrama-brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya, çüdra, brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is advised that no one take sannyäsa."

            "content": "From this we can understand that in this age the sannyäsa-äçrama is forbidden because people are not strong. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu showed us an example in taking sannyäsa at the age of twenty-four years, but even Särvabhauma Bhaööäcärya advised Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu to be extremely careful because He had taken sannyäsa at an early age. For preaching we give young boys sannyäsa, but actually it is being experienced that they are not fit for sannyäsa. There is no harm, however, if one thinks that he is unfit for sannyäsa; if he is very much agitated sexually, he should go to the äçrama where sex is allowed, namely the gåhastha-äçrama. That one has been found to be very weak in one place does not mean that he should stop fighting the crocodile of mäyä. One should take shelter of the lotus feet of Kåñëa, as we shall see Gajendra do, and at the same time one can be a gåhastha if he is satisfied with sexual indulgence. There is no need to give up the fight. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu therefore recommended, sthäne sthitäù çruti-gatäà tanu-vän-manobhiù. One may stay in whichever äçrama is suitable for him; it is not essential that one take sannyäsa. If one is sexually agitated, he can enter the gåhastha-äçrama. But one must continue fighting. For one who is not in a transcendental position, to take sannyäsa artificially is not a very great credit. If sannyäsa is not suitable, one may enter the gåhastha-äçrama and fight mäyä with great strength. But one should not give up the fighting and go away."
