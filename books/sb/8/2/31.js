The King of the elephants, in his condition of danger, decided to seek shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. After considerable thought, he intelligently arrived at this correct decision. Such a decision is not reached by a sinful man. Therefore in Bhagavad-gétä it is said that those who are pious (sukåté) can decide that in a dangerous or awkward condition one should seek shelter of the lotus feet of Kåñëa."
