There are trees, and the land is made of emeralds. Such is the creation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has sung in this regard, keçava! tuyä jagata vicitra: \"My Lord Keçava, Your creation is colorful and full of varieties.\" Geologists, botanists and other so-called scientists speculate about other planetary systems, but being unable to estimate the varieties on other planets, they falsely imagine that all planets but this one are vacant, uninhabited, and full of dust. Although they cannot even estimate the varieties existing throughout the universe, they are very proud of their knowledge, and they are accepted as learned by persons of a similar caliber. As described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  our duty is to follow the instructions of the mahäjanas. There are twelve mahäjanas, and Çukadeva Gosvämé is one of them."
