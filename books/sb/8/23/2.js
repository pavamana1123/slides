I merely endeavored to offer You obeisances, but nonetheless the attempt was as successful as those of pure devotees.

The Lord is so merciful, however, that although Bali Mahäräja did not actually offer obeisances but only endeavored to do so within his mind, the Supreme Personality of Godhead blessed him with more mercy than even the demigods could ever expect. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä , svalpam apy asya dharmasya träyate mahato bhayät: \"Even a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.\" The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as bhäva-grähé janärdana because He takes only the essence of a devotee's attitude. If a devotee sincerely surrenders, the Lord, as the Supersoul in everyone's heart, immediately understands this. Thus even though, externally, a devotee may not render full service, if he is internally sincere and serious the Lord welcomes his service nonetheless. Thus the Lord is known as bhäva-grähé janärdana because He takes the essence of one's devotional mentality."
