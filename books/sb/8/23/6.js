    "translation": "Prahläda Mahäräja said: O Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are universally worshiped; even Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva worship Your lotus feet. Yet although You are such a great personality, You have kindly promised to protect us, the demons. I think that such kindness has never been achieved even by Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva or the goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, what to speak of other demigods or common people.",

Another meaning of durga is \"difficulty.\" Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead promised to protect Bali Mahäräja and his associates from all dangers, He is addressed here as durga-päla, the Lord who gives protection from all miserable conditions."
