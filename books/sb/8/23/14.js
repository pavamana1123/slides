It might be argued that since Bali Mahäräja had now left the scene, how could his faults be judged? In reply to this, Lord Viñëu informed Çukräcärya that there was no need for Bali Mahäräja's presence, for his faults and discrepancies could be nullified if judged before the brähmaëas. As will be seen in the next verse, Bali Mahäräja had no faults; Çukräcärya had unnecessarily cursed him. Nonetheless, this was better for Bali Mahäräja. Being cursed by Çukräcärya, Bali Mahäräja was deprived of all his possessions, with the result that the Supreme Personality of Godhead favored him for his strong faith in devotional service. Of course, a devotee is not required to engage in fruitive activities. As stated in the çästra, sarvärhaëam acyutejyä . By worshiping Acyuta, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one satisfies everyone. Because Bali Mahäräja had satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there were no discrepancies in his performance of sacrifices."
