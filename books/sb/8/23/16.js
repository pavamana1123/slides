            "content": "\"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.\" (Båhan-näradéya Puräëa 38.126) In this age of Kali, it is extremely difficult to perform Vedic ritualistic ceremonies or sacrifices perfectly. Hardly anyone can chant the Vedic mantras with perfect pronunciation or accumulate the paraphernalia for Vedic performances. Therefore the sacrifice recommended in this age is saìkértana, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord. Yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù . Instead of wasting time performing Vedic sacrifices, those who are intelligent, those who possess good brain substance, should take to the chanting of the Lord's holy name and thus perform sacrifice perfectly. I have seen that many religious leaders are addicted to performing yajïas and spending hundreds and thousands of rupees for imperfect sacrificial performances. This is a lesson for those who unnecessarily execute such imperfect sacrifices. We should take the advice of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu (yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù). Although Çukräcärya was a strict brähmaëa addicted to ritualistic activities, he also admitted, niçchidram anusaìkértanaà tava: \"My Lord, constant chanting of the holy name of Your Lordship makes everything perfect.\" In Kali-yuga the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies cannot be performed as perfectly as before. Therefore Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has recommended that although one should take care to follow all the principles in every kind of spiritual activity, especially in worship of the Deity, there is still a chance of discrepancies, and one should compensate for this by chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In our Kåñëa consciousness movement we therefore give special stress to the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra in all activities."
