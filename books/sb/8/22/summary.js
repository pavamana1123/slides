            "content": "Bali Mahäräja was extremely truthful. Being unable to keep his promise, he was very much afraid, for he knew that one who has deviated from truthfulness is insignificant in the eyes of society. An exalted person can suffer the consequences of hellish life, but he is very much afraid of being defamed for deviation from the truth. Bali Mahäräja agreed with great pleasure to accept the punishment awarded him by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bali Mahäräja's dynasty there were many asuras who because of their enmity toward Viñëu had achieved a destination more exalted than that of many mystic yogés. Bali Mahäräja specifically remembered the determination of Prahläda Mahäräja in devotional service. Considering all these points, he decided to give his head in charity as the place for Viñëu's third step. Bali Mahäräja also considered how great personalities give up their family relationships and material possessions to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, they sometimes even sacrifice their lives for the satisfaction of the Lord, just to become His personal servants. Accordingly, by following in the footsteps of previous äcäryas and devotees, Bali Mahäräja perceived himself successful."

            "content": "While Bali Mahäräja, having been arrested by the ropes of Varuëa, was offering prayers to the Lord, his grandfather Prahläda Mahäräja appeared there and described how the Supreme Personality of Godhead had delivered Bali Mahäräja by taking his possessions in a tricky way. While Prahläda Mahäräja was present, Lord Brahmä and Bali's wife, Vindhyävali, described the supremacy of the Supreme Lord. Since Bali Mahäräja had given everything to the Lord, they prayed for his release. The Lord then described how a nondevotee's possession of wealth is a danger whereas a devotee's opulence is a benediction from the Lord. Then, being pleased with Bali Mahäräja, the Supreme Lord offered His disc to protect Bali Mahäräja and promised to remain with him."
