A pure devotee never complains against the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A vivid example is Prahläda Mahäräja. Examining the life of Prahläda Mahäräja, we can see how severely he was harassed by his own father, Hiraëyakaçipu, yet he did not divert his attention from the Lord even to the smallest extent. Bali Mahäräja, following in the footsteps of his grandfather Prahläda Mahäräja, remained fixed in his devotion to the Lord, despite the Lord's having punished him."
