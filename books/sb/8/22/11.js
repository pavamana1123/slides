As described by Bali Mahäräja, Lord Viñëu was actually not the enemy of the family but the best friend of the family. The principle of this friendship has already been stated. Yasyäham anugåhnämi hariñye tad-dhanaà çanaiù:  the Lord bestows special favor upon His devotee by taking away all his material opulences. Bali Mahäräja appreciated this behavior by the Lord. Therefore he said, daivena nétaù prasabhaà tyäjita-çréù: \"It is to bring me to the right platform of eternal life that You have put me into these circumstances.\""

As indicated by Bali Mahäräja by the words janäd bhétaù, every devotee in Kåñëa consciousness should always be afraid of the common man engaged in pursuing material prosperity. Such a person is described as pramatta, a madman chasing the will-o'-the-wisp. Such men do not know that after a hard struggle for life one must change his body, with no certainty of what kind of body he will receive next. Those who are completely established in Kåñëa conscious philosophy and who therefore understand the aim of life will never take to the activities of the materialistic dog race. But if a sincere devotee somehow does fall down, the Lord corrects him and saves him from gliding down to the darkest region of hellish life."

Because of uncontrolled senses, people fully engage in sinful activities by which they get a body full of suffering. Bali Mahäräja appreciated how the Lord had saved him from such a bewildered life of ignorance. He therefore said that his intelligence had been stunned. Stabdha-matir na budhyate. He could not understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead favors His devotees by forcibly stopping their materialistic activities."
