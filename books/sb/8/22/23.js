    "translation": "By offering even water, newly grown grass, or flower buds at Your lotus feet, those who maintain no mental duplicity can achieve the most exalted position within the spiritual world. This Bali Mahäräja, without duplicity, has now offered everything in the three worlds. How then can he deserve to suffer from arrest?",

Then the devotee is promoted to Vaikuëöha, the spiritual world. Brahmä drew the Lord's attention to this subject and requested that He release Bali Mahäräja, who was suffering, being bound by the ropes of Varuëa, and who had already given everything, including the three worlds and whatever he possessed."
