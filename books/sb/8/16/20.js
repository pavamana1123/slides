Of course, that is nice, but actually a material relative cannot do anything good for anyone. If anything good can be done, it is done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva. Therefore, Kaçyapa Muni advised his wife, Aditi, to begin worshiping Lord Väsudeva, who is situated in everyone's heart. He is the friend of everyone and is known as Janärdana because He can kill all enemies. There are three modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance—and above material nature, transcendental to material nature, is another existence, which is called çuddha-sattva. In the material world, the mode of goodness is considered the best, but because of material contamination, even the mode of goodness is sometimes overpowered by the modes of passion and ignorance. But when one transcends the competition between these modes and engages himself in devotional service, he rises above the three modes of material nature. In that transcendental position, one is situated in pure consciousness. Sattvaà viçuddhaà vasudeva-çabditam . When one realizes Väsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes most exalted."

Kaçyapa Muni advised his wife to seek shelter at the lotus feet of Väsudeva, Kåñëa, so that all her problems would be very easily solved. Thus Kaçyapa Muni was an ideal spiritual master. He was not so foolish that he would present himself as an exalted personality, as good as God. He was actually a bona fide guru because he advised his wife to seek shelter at the lotus feet of Väsudeva. One who trains his subordinate or disciple to worship Väsudeva is the truly bona fide spiritual master. The word jagad-gurum is very important in this regard. Kaçyapa Muni did not falsely declare himself to be jagad-guru, although he actually was jagad-guru because he advocated the cause of Väsudeva. Actually, Väsudeva is jagad-guru, as clearly stated here (väsudevaà jagad-gurum). One who teaches the instructions of Väsudeva, Bhagavad-gétä, is as good as väsudevaà jagad-gurum. But when one who does not teach this instruction—as it is—declares himself jagad-guru, he simply cheats the public. Kåñëa is jagad-guru, and one who teaches the instruction of Kåñëa as it is, on behalf of Kåñëa, may be accepted as jagad-guru. One who manufactures his own theories cannot be accepted; he becomes jagad-guru falsely."
