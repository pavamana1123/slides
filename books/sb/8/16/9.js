Similarly, brähmaëa-bhojana, feeding of the brähmaëas, is also recommended, for when the brähmaëas eat sumptuous remnants of food after yajïa, this is another way that Lord Viñëu Himself eats. Therefore the Vedic principles recommend that in every festival or ceremony one offer oblations to the fire and give sumptuous food for the brähmaëas to eat. By such activities, a householder may be elevated to the heavenly planets and similar places in the higher planetary systems."
