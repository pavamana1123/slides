            "content": "Sometimes less intelligent men ask whether one has to approach a guru to be instructed in devotional service for spiritual advancement. The answer is given here—indeed, not only here, but also in Bhagavad-gétä, where Arjuna accepted Kåñëa as his guru (çiñyas te 'haà çädhi mäà tväà prapannam ). One should definitely understand this. In Caitanya-caritämåta it is said that the guru is the manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, according to all the evidence given by the çästra and by the practical behavior of devotees, one must accept a guru. Aditi accepted her husband as her guru, so that he would direct her how to advance in spiritual consciousness, devotional service, by worshiping the Supreme Lord."
