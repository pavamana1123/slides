            "content": "Since the demigods were not visible in the heavenly kingdom, their mother, Aditi, because of separation from them, was very much aggrieved. One day after many, many years, the great sage Kaçyapa emerged from a trance of meditation and returned to his äçrama. He saw that the äçrama was no longer beautiful and that his wife was very morose. Everywhere in the äçrama, he saw signs of lamentation. The great sage therefore inquired from his wife about the well-being of the äçrama and asked her why she looked so morose. After Aditi informed Kaçyapa Muni about the äçrama's well-being, she told him that she was lamenting for the absence of her sons. She then requested him to tell her how her sons could return and reoccupy their positions. She wanted all good fortune for her sons. Moved by Aditi's request, Kaçyapa Muni instructed her in the philosophy of self-realization, the difference between matter and spirit, and how to be unaffected by material loss. But when he saw that Aditi was not satisfied even after he had given these instructions, he advised her to worship Väsudeva, Janärdana. He assured her that only Lord Väsudeva could satisfy her and fulfill all her desires. When Aditi then expressed her desire to worship Lord Väsudeva, Prajäpati Kaçyapa told her about a process of worship known as payo-vrata, which is executed in twelve days. Lord Brahmä had instructed him how to satisfy Lord Kåñëa by this process, and thus he advised his wife to observe this vow and its regulative principles."
