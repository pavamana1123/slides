One who tries to get liberation from this material world is called mokña-käma, one who wants to enjoy this material world to its fullest extent is called sarva-käma, and one who has fulfilled all his desires and has no further material desires is called akäma. A bhakta has no desire. Sarvopädhi-vinirmuktaà tat-paratvena nirmalam . He is purified and free from material desires. The mokña-kämé wants to achieve liberation by merging into the existence of the Supreme Brahman, and because of this desire to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is not yet pure. And since those who want liberation are impure, what to speak of the karmés, who have so many desires to fulfill? Nonetheless, the çästra says:"

In other words, everyone, regardless of whether he is a karmé, jïäné, yogé or bhakta, should invariably take shelter of the lotus feet of Väsudeva and render transcendental loving service unto Him so that all his desires will be duly fulfilled. Kåñëa is déna-anukampana: He is very merciful to everyone. Therefore if one wants to fulfill his material desires, Kåñëa helps him. Of course, sometimes if a devotee is very sincere, the Lord, as a special favor to him, refuses to fulfill his material desires and directly blesses him with pure, unalloyed devotional service. It is said in Caitanya-caritämåta :"

Indeed, he is just like a person who gives up ambrosia to drink poison. Since I am very intelligent, why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him to take the nectar of the shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget illusory material enjoyment.' \" If a devotee maintains some material desire and at the same time very sincerely desires to engage at the lotus feet of Kåñëa, Kåñëa may directly give him unalloyed devotional service and take away all his material desires and possessions. This is the Lord's special favor to devotees. Otherwise, if one takes to Kåñëa's devotional service but still has material desires to fulfill, he may become free from all material desires, as Dhruva Mahäräja did, but this may take some time. However, if a very sincere devotee wants only Kåñëa's lotus feet, Kåñëa directly gives him the position of çuddha-bhakti, unalloyed devotional service."
