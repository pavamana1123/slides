            "content": "In this verse, Aditi has been addressed by her husband, Kaçyapa Muni, as gåha-medhini, which means \"one who is satisfied in household life for sense gratification.\" Generally, those who are in household life pursue sense gratification in the field of activities performed for material results. Such gåhamedhés have only one aim in life—sense gratification. Therefore it is said, yan maithunädi-gåhamedhi-sukhaà hi tuccham: , dharmasya hy äpavargyasya närtho 'rthäyopakalpate: \"All occupational engagements are certainly meant for ultimate liberation. They should never be performed for material gain.\" Those who are in household life should not think that religion is meant to improve the process of the householder's sense gratification. Household life is also meant for advancement in spiritual understanding, by which one can ultimately gain liberation from the material clutches. One should remain in household life with the aim of understanding the ultimate goal of life (tattva jijïäsä). Then household life is as good as the life of a yogi. Kaçyapa Muni therefore inquired from his wife whether the principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification were being properly followed in terms of the çästric injunctions. As soon as one deviates from the injunctions of the çästra, the purpose of household life is immediately lost in confusion."
