Regardless of whether one be a brähmaëa, çüdra, vaiçya, kñatriya, or even the lowest of men, a caëòäla, he should be welcome to accept prasäda. However, when the caëòälas, the lower class or poorer class, are taking prasäda, this does not mean that they have become Näräyaëa or Viñëu. Näräyaëa is situated in everyone's heart, but this does not mean Näräyaëa is a caëòäla or poor man. The Mäyäväda philosophy of accepting a poor man as Näräyaëa is the most envious and atheistic movement in Vedic culture. This mentality should be completely given up. Everyone should be given the opportunity to take prasäda, but this does not mean that everyone has the right to become Näräyaëa."
