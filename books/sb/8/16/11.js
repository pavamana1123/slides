Kaçyapa Muni was not in the renounced order of life. Therefore he is addressed here once as brahman and another time as gåhamedhin. Aditi, his wife, assured him that as far as household life was concerned, everything was going nicely, and the brähmaëas and cows were being honored and protected. In other words, there were no disturbances; household life was duly progressing."
