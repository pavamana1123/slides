This is also acknowledged to be the best of all ritualistic ceremonies. O gentle lady, it is the essence of all austerities, and it is the process of giving charity and pleasing the supreme controller.",

And how Lord Viñëu is worshiped in this payo-vrata ceremony has now been fully described. The ultimate goal of life is to please Lord Viñëu by varëäçrama-dharma. The Vedic principles of four varëas and four äçramas are meant for worship of Viñëu (viñëur ärädhyate puàsäà nänyat tat-toña-käraëam). The Kåñëa consciousness movement is also viñëu-ärädhanam, or worship of Lord Viñëu, according to the age. The payo-vrata method of viñëu-ärädhanam was enunciated long, long ago by Kaçyapa Muni to his wife, Aditi, in the heavenly planets, and the same process is bona fide on earth even now. Especially for this age of Kali, the process accepted by the Kåñëa consciousness movement is to open hundreds and thousands of Viñëu temples (temples of Rädhä-Kåñëa, Jagannätha, Balaräma, Sétä-Räma, Gaura-Nitäi and so on). Performing prescribed worship in such temples of Viñëu and thus worshiping the Lord is as good as performing the payo-vrata ceremony recommended here. The payo-vrata ceremony is performed from the first to the thirteenth day of the bright fortnight of the moon, but in our Kåñëa consciousness movement Lord Viñëu is worshiped in every temple according to a schedule of twenty-four hours of engagement in performing kértana, chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, offering palatable food to Lord Viñëu and distributing this food to Vaiñëavas and others. These are authorized activities, and if the members of the Kåñëa consciousness movement stick to these principles, they will achieve the same result one gains by observing the payo-vrata ceremony. Thus the essence of all auspicious activities, such as performing yajïa, giving in charity, observing vratas, and undergoing austerities, is included in the Kåñëa consciousness movement. The members of this movement should immediately and sincerely follow the processes already recommended. Of course, sacrifice is meant to please Lord Viñëu. Yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù:  in Kali-yuga, those who are intelligent perform the saìkértana-yajïa. One should follow this process conscientiously."
