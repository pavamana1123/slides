Hiraëyakaçipu, however, maintained his enmity and his anger against Lord Viñëu until the point of death. He never forgot his vengeful attitude toward Viñëu for having killed his brother, Hiraëyäkña. Others in the bodily concept of life are angry at their enemies but not at Lord Viñëu. Hiraëyakaçipu, however, was everlastingly angry. He was angry not only because of false prestige but also because of continuous enmity toward Viñëu."
