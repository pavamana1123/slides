As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam ), one can naturally sacrifice everything to satisfy Him. Although Bali Mahäräja was a devotee, he was attached to material possessions, and therefore the Lord, being very kind to him, showed him special favor by appearing as Lord Vämana to take away all his material possessions, and his mind as well."
