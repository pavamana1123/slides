At the present, however, because people are bereft of all knowledge, they spend all their money for the satisfaction of their family. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé taught us by his own example by using fifty percent of his accumulated wealth for Kåñëa, twenty-five percent for his own self, and twenty-five percent for the members of his family. One's main purpose should be to advance in Kåñëa consciousness. This will include dharma, artha and käma. However, because one's family members expect some profit, one should also satisfy them by giving them a portion of one's accumulated wealth. This is a çästric injunction."
