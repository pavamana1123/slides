Lord Vämanadeva, therefore, had not gone to Bali Mahäräja for His own self-interest. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäà sarva-loka-maheçvaram. The Lord is the proprietor of all planets, in both the material and spiritual worlds. Why should He be in want of land? Bali Mahäräja rightly said that Lord Vämanadeva was not at all prudent in regard to His own personal interests. Lord Vämanadeva had approached Bali not for His personal welfare but for the welfare of His devotees. Devotees sacrifice all personal interests to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and similarly the Supreme Lord, although having no personal interests, can do anything for the interests of His devotees. One who is full in himself has no personal interests."
