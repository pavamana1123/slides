    "translation": "You have promised to give Him three steps of land in charity, but when you give it He will occupy the three worlds. You are a rascal! You do not know what a great mistake you have made. After giving everything to Lord Viñëu, you will have no means of livelihood. How then shall you live?",

            "content": "Bali Mahäräja might argue that he had promised only three steps of land. But Çukräcärya, being a very learned brähmaëa, immediately understood that this was a plan of Hari, who had falsely appeared there as a brahmacäré. The words müòha vartiñyase katham reveal that Çukräcärya was a brähmaëa of the priestly class. Such priestly brähmaëas are mostly interested in receiving remuneration from their disciples. Therefore when Çukräcärya saw that Bali Mahäräja had risked all of his possessions, he understood that this would cause havoc not only to the King but also to the family of Çukräcärya, who was dependent on Mahäräja Bali's mercy. This is the difference between a Vaiñëava and a smärta-brähmaëa. A smärta-brähmaëa is always interested in material profit, whereas a Vaiñëava is interested only in satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. From the statement of Çukräcärya, it appears that he was in all respects a smärta-brähmaëa interested only in personal gain."
