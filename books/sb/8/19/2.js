Someone might argue that since Prahläda Mahäräja, even though very old, was attached to his family, and specifically to his grandson Bali Mahäräja, how could he be an ideal example? Therefore this verse uses the word praçäntaù. A devotee is always sober. He is never disturbed by any conditions. Even if a devotee remains in gåhastha life and does not renounce material possessions, he should still be understood to be praçänta, sober, because of his pure devotion to the Lord. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu therefore said:"
