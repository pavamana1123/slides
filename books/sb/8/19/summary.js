Bali Mahäräja agreed to give this land in charity, since this was very insignificant, but Çukräcärya, who could understand that Vämanadeva was Viñëu, the friend of the demigods, forbade Bali Mahäräja to give this land. Çukräcärya advised Bali Mahäräja to withdraw his promise. He explained that in subduing others, in joking, in responding to danger, in acting for the welfare of others, and so on, one could refuse to fulfill one's promise, and there would be no fault. By this philosophy, Çukräcärya tried to dissuade Bali Mahäräja from giving land to Lord Vämanadeva."
