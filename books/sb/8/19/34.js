How then will you give Him a place for His third step?\" Çukräcärya did not know how the Lord protects His devotee. The devotee must risk everything in his possession for the service of the Lord, but he is always protected and never defeated. By materialistic calculations, Çukräcärya thought that Bali Mahäräja would under no circumstances be able to keep his promise to the brahmacäré, Lord Vämanadeva."
