    "translation": "Unable to see Him, Hiraëyakaçipu said, \"I have searched the entire universe, but I could not find Viñëu, who has killed my brother. Therefore, He must certainly have gone to that place from which no one returns. [In other words, He must now be dead.]\"",

            "content": "Atheists generally follow the Bauddha philosophical conclusion that at death everything is finished. Hiraëyakaçipu, being an atheist, thought this way. Because Lord Viñëu was not visible to him, he thought that the Lord was dead. Even today, many people follow the philosophy that God is dead. But God is never dead. Even the living entity, who is part of God, never dies. Na jäyate mriyate vä kadäcit: \"For the soul there is never birth or death.\" This is the statement of Bhagavad-gétä . Both the Lord and the living entity exist as unborn and inexhaustible personalities. Thus Hiraëyakaçipu's conclusion that Viñëu was dead was wrong."

            "content": "As indicated by the words yato nävartate pumän, there is certainly a spiritual kingdom, and if the living entity goes there, he never returns to this material world. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä ). Here the same fact is stated: yato nävartate pumän. Any person who goes back home, back to Godhead, does not return to this material world."
