    "translation": "Lord Vämanadeva continued: O King of the demons, after Lord Viñëu made this decision, He entered the body of His enemy Hiraëyakaçipu, who was running after Him with great force. In a subtle body inconceivable to Hiraëyakaçipu, Lord Viñëu, who was in great anxiety, entered Hiraëyakaçipu's nostril along with his breath.",

Logically, therefore, it was not at all difficult for Lord Viñëu to enter Hiraëyakaçipu's body. The word vivigna-cetäù, \"very anxious,\" is significant. It is not that Lord Viñëu was afraid of Hiraëyakaçipu; rather, because of compassion, Lord Viñëu was in anxiety about how to act for his welfare."
