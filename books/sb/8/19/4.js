    "translation": "O King Bali, never in your dynasty has the low-minded King been born who upon being requested has refused charity to brähmaëas in holy places or a fight to kñatriyas on a battlefield. And your dynasty is even more glorious due to the presence of Prahläda Mahäräja, who is like the beautiful moon in the sky.",

A kñatriya does not refuse to give charity when requested by a brähmaëa, nor can he refuse to fight another kñatriya. A king who does refuse is called low-minded. In the dynasty of Bali Mahäräja there were no such low-minded kings."
