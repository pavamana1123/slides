In that ocean there are innumerable planets, and each planet is called a dvépa, or island. When approached by Lord Vämanadeva, Bali Mahäräja was actually in possession of all the dvépas, or islands in space. Bali Mahäräja was very pleased to see the features of Vämanadeva and was ready to give Him as much land as He could ask, but because Lord Vämanadeva asked only three paces of land, Bali Mahäräja considered Him not very intelligent."
