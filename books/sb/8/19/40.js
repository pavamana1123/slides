Sometimes the spiritual body of the spiritual master is misunderstood. But Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé instructs, präpaïcikatayä buddhyä hari-sambandhi-vastunaù. The body fully engaged in Kåñëa's service should not be neglected as material. One who does neglect it is false in his renunciation. If the body is not properly maintained, it falls down and dries up like an uprooted tree, from which flowers and fruit can no longer be obtained. The Vedas therefore enjoin:"
