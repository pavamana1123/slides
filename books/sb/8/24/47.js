Because the conditioned soul does not know this, he is said to be in avidyä, or ignorance. Because of a false hope for happiness, the conditioned soul becomes involved in various plans for material activity. Here Mahäräja Satyavrata prays that the Lord sever this hard knot of false happiness and thus become his supreme spiritual master."
