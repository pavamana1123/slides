    "translation": "As a blind man, being unable to see, accepts another blind man as his leader, people who do not know the goal of life accept someone as a guru who is a rascal and a fool. But we are interested in self-realization. Therefore we accept You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as our spiritual master, for You are able to see in all directions and are omniscient like the sun.",

Sometimes a foolish person accepts someone as a guru because he can manufacture a small quantity of gold by mystic yogic power. Because such a disciple has a poor fund of knowledge, he cannot judge whether the manufacture of gold is the criterion for a guru. Why should one not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, from whom unlimited numbers of gold mines come into being? Ahaà sarvasya prabhavo mattaù sarvaà pravartate . In other words, one is advised not to accept a guru who does not follow the path of instruction given by Lord Kåñëa."
