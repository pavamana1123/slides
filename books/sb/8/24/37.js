Brahmä's night takes place when Brahmä goes to sleep, but in the daytime there are fourteen Manus, one of whom is Cäkñuña Manu. Therefore, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments that although it was daytime for Lord Brahmä, Brahmä felt sleepy for a short time by the supreme will of the Lord. This short period is regarded as Lord Brahmä's night. This has been elaborately discussed by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in his Laghu-bhägavatämåta. The following is a summary of his analysis. Because Agastya Muni cursed Sväyambhuva Manu, during the time of Sväyambhuva Manu a devastation took place. This devastation is mentioned in the Matsya Puräëa. During the time of Cäkñuña Manu, by the supreme will of the Lord, there was suddenly another pralaya, or devastation. This is mentioned by Märkaëòeya Åñi in the Viñëu-dharmottara. At the end of Manu's time there is not necessarily a devastation, but at the end of the Cäkñuña-manvantara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His illusory energy, wanted to show Satyavrata the effects of devastation. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé also agrees with this opinion. The Laghu-bhägavatämåta says:"
