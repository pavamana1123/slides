Lord Viñëu's purpose was to take back all the Vedic literatures from the demon Hayagréva and restore them to Lord Brahmä. Incidentally, by His causeless mercy, the Lord spoke with Satyavrata. The word satyavratänäm is significant because it indicates that those on the level of Satyavrata can take knowledge from the Vedas delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whatever is spoken by the Supreme Lord is accepted as Veda. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, vedänta-kåd veda-vit: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the compiler of all Vedic knowledge, and He knows the purport of the Vedas. Therefore, anyone who takes knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, or from Bhagavad-gétä as it is, knows the purpose of the Vedas (vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù . One cannot understand Vedic knowledge from the veda-väda-ratäs, who read the Vedas and misconstrue their subject matter. One has to know the Vedas from the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
