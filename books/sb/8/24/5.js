            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead generally appears in various types of incarnations to give protection to the cows and brähmaëas. The Lord is described as go-brähmaëa-hitäya ca; in other words, He is always eager to benefit the cows and brähmaëas. When Lord Kåñëa appeared, He purposefully became a cowherd boy and showed personally how to give protection to the cows and calves. Similarly, He showed respect to Sudämä Vipra, a real brähmaëa. From the Lord's personal activities, human society should learn how to give protection specifically to the brähmaëas and cows. Then the protection of religious principles, fulfillment of the aim of life and protection of Vedic knowledge can be achieved. Without protection of cows, brahminical culture cannot be maintained; and without brahminical culture, the aim of life cannot be fulfilled. The Lord, therefore, is described as go-brähmaëa-hitäya because His incarnation is only for the protection of the cows and brähmaëas. Unfortunately, because in Kali-yuga there is no protection of the cows and brahminical culture, everything is in a precarious position. If human society wants to be exalted, the leaders of society must follow the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä and give protection to the cows, the brähmaëas and brahminical culture."
