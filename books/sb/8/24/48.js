    "translation": "One who wants to be free of material entanglement should take to the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and give up the contamination of ignorance, involving pious and impious activities. Thus one regains his original identity, just as a block of gold or silver sheds all dirt and becomes purified when treated with fire. May that inexhaustible Supreme Personality of Godhead become our spiritual master, for He is the original spiritual master of all other spiritual masters.",

Therefore the purpose of human life is to purify oneself of this contamination so that one can regain his spiritual form and not undergo this cycle of birth and death. The recommended process of decontamination is devotional service to the Lord. There are various processes for self-realization, such as karma, jïäna and yoga, but none of them is equal to the process of devotional service. As gold and silver can be freed from all dirty contamination by being put into a fire but not merely by being washed, the living entity can be awakened to his own identity by performing devotional service (yat-sevayä), but not by karma, jïäna or yoga. Cultivation of speculative knowledge or practice of yogic gymnastics will not be helpful."

Similarly, the original luster of the living being, who is part of the sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1), is the luster of änanda, or pleasure. Änandamayo bhyäsät. Every living entity has the right to become änandamaya, joyful, because he is part of the sac-cid-änanda-vigraha, Kåñëa. Why should the living being be put into tribulation because of dirty contamination by the material modes of nature? The living entity should become purified and regain his svarüpa, his original identity. This he can do only by devotional service. Therefore, one should adopt the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described here as guror guruù, the spiritual master of all other spiritual masters."

            "content": "Even though we may not have the fortune to contact the Supreme Lord personally, the Lord's representative is as good as the Lord Himself because such a representative does not say anything unless it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu therefore gives a definition of guru. Yäre dekha, täre kaha 'kåñëa'-upadeça:  the bona fide guru is he who advises his disciples exactly in accordance with the principles spoken by Kåñëa. The bona fide guru is he who has accepted Kåñëa as guru. This is the guru-paramparä system. The original guru is Vyäsadeva because he is the speaker of Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, wherein everything spoken relates to Kåñëa. Therefore guru-püjä is known as Vyäsa-püjä. In the final analysis, the original guru is Kåñëa, His disciple is Närada, whose disciple is Vyäsa, and in this way we gradually come in touch with the guru-paramparä. One cannot become a guru if he does not know what the Personality of Godhead Kåñëa or His incarnation wants. The mission of the guru is the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: to spread Kåñëa consciousness all over the world."
