Nothing is hidden from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He is in everyone's heart. Indeed, the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä , sarvasya cähaà hådi sanniviñöo mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca: \"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.\" Whatever happened had taken place under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore there was no cause to be sorry or ashamed. Although Lord Çiva is never defeated by anyone, when defeated by Lord Viñëu he felt proud that he had such an exalted and powerful master."
