But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.\" This partiality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is natural. A person cares for his children not because of partiality but in a reciprocation of love. The children depend on the father's affection, and the father affectionately maintains the children. Similarly, because devotees do not know anything but the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord is always prepared to give protection to His devotees and fulfill their desires. He therefore says, kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati:  \"O son of Kunté, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.\""
