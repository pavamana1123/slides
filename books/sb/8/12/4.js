            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, resides within the material world as the sattva-guëa-avatära. Lord Çiva is the tamo-guëa-avatära, and Lord Brahmä is the rajo-guëa-avatära, but although Lord Viñëu is among them, He is not in the same category. Lord Viñëu is deva-deva, the chief of all the demigods. Since Lord Çiva is in this material world, the energy of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, includes Lord Çiva. Lord Viñëu is therefore called jagad-vyäpé, \"the all-pervading Lord.\" Lord Çiva is sometimes called Maheçvara, and so people think that Lord Çiva is everything. But here Lord Çiva addresses Lord Viñëu as Jagad-éça, \"the master of the universe.\" Lord Çiva is sometimes called Viçveçvara, but here he addresses Lord Viñëu as Jagan-maya, indicating that even Viçveçvara is under Lord Viñëu's control. Lord Viñëu is the master of the spiritual world, yet He controls the material world also, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sacaräcaram ). Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva are also sometimes called éçvara, but the supreme éçvara is Lord Viñëu, Lord Kåñëa. As stated in Brahma-saàhitä, éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù: (BS 5.1) the Supreme Lord is Kåñëa, Lord Viñëu. Everything in existence works in proper order because of Lord Viñëu. Aëòäntara-stha-paramäëu-cayäntara-stham (BS 5.35). Even paramäëu, the small atoms, work because of Lord Viñëu's presence within them."
