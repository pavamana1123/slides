The Säìkhya philosophers regard You as the transcendental person who is beyond prakåti and puruña and who is the controller of even the demigods. The followers of the codes of devotional service known as the Païcarätras regard You as being endowed with nine different potencies. And the Pataïjala philosophers, the followers of Pataïjali Muni, regard You as the supreme independent Personality of Godhead, who has no equal or superior.",
