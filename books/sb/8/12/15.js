            "content": "When the Supreme Personality of Godhead assumed the form of the beautiful woman Mohiné-mürti, the demons were certainly captivated, but the demigods present were not. In other words, those who maintain a demoniac mentality are bewildered by the beauty of a woman, but those who are advanced in Kåñëa consciousness, or even those on the platform of goodness, are not bewildered. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knew that because Lord Çiva is not an ordinary person, he cannot be bewildered even by the most beautiful woman. Cupid himself tried to invoke Lord Çiva's lusty desires in the presence of Pärvaté, but Lord Çiva was never agitated. Rather, the blazing fire from Lord Çiva's eyes turned Cupid to ashes. Therefore, Lord Viñëu had to think twice about what kind of beautiful form would bewilder even Lord Çiva. Consequently He was smiling gravely, as stated in the previous verse (prahasya bhäva-gambhéram). A beautiful woman generally cannot induce Lord Çiva to be lusty, but Lord Viñëu was considering whether there was any form of woman who could enchant him."
