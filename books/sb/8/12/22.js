Such are the affairs that began when Lord Çiva observed the beautiful girl playing with the ball. In such activities, the influence of Cupid is very prominent. As both parties move their eyebrows and glance at one another, their lusty desires increase more and more. Such reciprocations of lusty desire took place between Lord Çiva and the beautiful woman, even though Umä and Lord Çiva's associates were by Lord Çiva's side. Such is the attraction between man and woman in the material world. Lord Çiva was supposed to be above all this attraction, but he was victimized by the captivating power of Lord Viñëu. Åñabhadeva thus explains the nature of lusty attraction:"
