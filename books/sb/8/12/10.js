Nonetheless, we are bewildered by Your illusory energy and cannot understand what this creation is. Aside from us, what is to be said of others, like the demons and human beings, who are in the base modes of material nature [rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa]? How will they know You?",

What then is to be said of those who are situated in rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa, the base qualities of material nature? How can we even imagine the Supreme Personality of Godhead? There are so many philosophers trying to understand the Absolute Truth, but since they are situated in the base qualities of material nature and are addicted to so many bad habits, like drinking, meat-eating, illicit sex and gambling, how can they conceive of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? For them it is impossible. For the present day, the päïcarätriké-vidhi as enunciated by Närada Muni is the only hope. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, therefore, has quoted the following verse from the Brahma-yämala:"

Without understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this way, one only creates a disturbance. In this age of Kali, so many gurus have sprung up, and because they do not refer to the çruti-småti-puräëädi-païcarätrika-vidhi, they are creating a great disturbance in the world in regard to understanding the Absolute Truth. However, those who follow the päïcarätriké-vidhi under the guidance of a proper spiritual master can understand the Absolute Truth. It is said, païcarätrasya kåtsnasya vaktä tu bhagavän svayam: the païcarätra system is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just like Bhagavad-gétä. Väsudeva-çaraëä vidur aïjasaiva: the truth can be understood only by one who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Väsudeva."
