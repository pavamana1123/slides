This does not mean, however, that because the ingredients come from Him, He is no longer complete. pürëasya pürëam ädäya pürëam evävaçiñyate:  everything emanates from Him. In all cases—nominative, objective, positive, negative and so on—whatever we may conceive of in this entire cosmic manifestation is in fact the Supreme Lord. For Him there are no such distinctions as \"this is mine, and this belongs to someone else,\" because He is everything. He is therefore called avyaya—changeless and inexhaustible. Because the Supreme Lord is avyaya, He is the Absolute Truth, the fully spiritual Supreme Brahman."
