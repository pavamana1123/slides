            "content": "One is in the material world when he thinks, \"I am this body, and everything with reference to my body is mine.\" Ato gåha-kñetra-sutäpta-vittair janasya moho 'yam ahaà mameti . This is the symptom of material life. In the materialistic conception of life, one thinks, \"This is my house, this is my land, this is my family, this is my state,\" and so on. But those who are munayaù, saintly persons following in the footsteps of Närada Muni, simply engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord without any personal desire for sense gratification. Anyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11]. Either in this life or in the next, the only concern of such saintly devotees is to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus they are also absolute because they have no other desires. Being freed from the dualities of material desire, they are called çreyas-kämäù. In other words, they are not concerned with dharma (religiosity), artha (economic development), or käma (sense gratification). The only concern of such devotees is mokña, liberation. This mokña does not refer to becoming one with the Supreme like the Mäyävädé philosophers. Caitanya Mahäprabhu explained that real mokña means taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead. The Lord clearly explained this fact while instructing Särvabhauma Bhaööäcärya. Särvabhauma Bhaööäcärya wanted to correct the word mukti-pade in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, but Caitanya Mahäprabhu informed him that there is no need to correct any word in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. He explained that mukti-pade refers to the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, who offers mukti and is therefore called Mukunda. A pure devotee is not concerned with material things. He is not concerned with religiosity, economic development or sense gratification. He is interested only in serving the lotus feet of the Lord."
