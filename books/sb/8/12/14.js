Mystic yogés want to acquire some power by practicing the yoga system, but Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is known as the Supreme Lord of all mystic power. Lord Çiva wanted to see the Mohiné-mürti, which was captivating the entire world, and Lord Viñëu was gravely thinking of how to captivate Lord Çiva also. Therefore the word bhäva-gambhéram is used here. The illusory, material energy is represented by Durgädevé, who is the wife of Giréça, or Lord Çiva. Durgädevé could not captivate Lord Çiva's mind, but now that Lord Çiva wanted to see Lord Viñëu's feminine form, Lord Viñëu, by His mystic power, would assume a form that would captivate even Lord Çiva. Therefore Lord Viñëu was grave and at the same time was smiling."
