She tried to bind Her hair with Her beautiful left hand, and at the same time She played with the ball by striking it with Her right hand.

Indeed, everyone is fully captivated by her activities. Lord Çambhu (Çiva) was not to be captivated by the external potency, but because Lord Viñëu wanted to captivate Him also, He exhibited His internal potency to act the way that His external potency acts to captivate ordinary living entities. Lord Viñëu can captivate anyone, even such a strong personality as Lord Çambhu."
