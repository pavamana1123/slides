His exemplary character was therefore praised by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who gave His benediction by saying, \"May all good fortune be upon you.\" When a devotee becomes a little proud, the Supreme Lord sometimes exhibits His supreme power to dissipate the devotee's misunderstanding. After being amply harassed by Lord Viñëu's potency, Lord Çiva resumed his normal, unagitated condition. This is the position of a devotee. A devotee should not be agitated under any circumstances, even in the worst reverses. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä , yasmin sthito na duùkhena guruëäpi vicälyate: because of his full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a devotee is never agitated, even in the greatest trials. This pridelessness is possible only for the first-class devotees, of whom Lord Çambhu is one."
