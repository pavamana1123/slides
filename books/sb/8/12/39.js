In Caitanya-caritämåta, they are described as mäyé, which means \"under mäyä's influence.\" But even though Lord Çiva associates with mäyä, he is not influenced. The living entities are affected by mäyä, but although Lord Çiva apparently associates with mäyä, he is not affected. In other words, all living entities within this material world except for Lord Çiva are swayed by mäyä. Lord Çiva is therefore neither viñëu-tattva nor jéva-tattva. He is between the two."
