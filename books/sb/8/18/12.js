    "translation": "The Lord appeared in His original form, with ornaments and weapons in His hands. Although this ever-existing form is not visible in the material world, He nonetheless appeared in this form. Then, in the presence of His father and mother, He assumed the form of Vämana, a brähmaëa-dwarf, a brahmacäré, just like a theatrical actor.",

            "content": "The word naöaù is significant. An actor changes dress to play different parts, but is always the same man. Similarly, as described in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.33, 39), the Lord assumes many thousands and millions of forms (advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam ädyaà puräëa-puruñam). He is always present with innumerable incarnations (rämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan nänävatäram akarod bhuvaneñu kintu). Nonetheless, although He appears in various incarnations, they are not different from one another. He is the same person, with the same potency, the same eternity and the same spiritual existence, but He can simultaneously assume various forms. When Vämanadeva appeared from the womb of His mother, He appeared in the form of Näräyaëa, with four hands equipped with the necessary symbolic weapons, and then immediately transformed Himself into a brahmacäré (vaöu). This means that His body is not material. One who thinks that the Supreme Lord assumes a material body is not intelligent. He has to learn more about the Lord's position. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä , janma karma ca me divyam evaà yo vetti tattvataù. One has to understand the transcendental appearance of the Lord in His original transcendental body (sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1))."
