            "content": "Lord Vämanadeva appeared in this world from the womb of Aditi completely equipped with conchshell, disc, club and lotus. His bodily hue was blackish, and He was dressed in yellow garments. Lord Viñëu appeared at an auspicious moment on Çravaëa-dvädaçé when the Abhijit star had arisen. At that time, in all the three worlds (including the higher planetary system, outer space and this earth), all the demigods, the cows, the brähmaëas and even the seasons were happy because of God's appearance. Therefore this auspicious day is called Vijayä. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has a sac-cid-änanda (BS 5.1) body, appeared as the son of Kaçyapa and Aditi, both of His parents were very astonished. After His appearance, the Lord assumed the form of a dwarf (Vämana). All the great sages expressed their jubilation, and with Kaçyapa Muni before them they performed the birthday ceremony of Lord Vämana. At the time of Lord Vämanadeva's sacred thread ceremony, He was honored by the sun-god, Båhaspati, the goddess presiding over the planet earth, the deity of the heavenly planets, His mother, Lord Brahmä, Kuvera, the seven åñis and others. Lord Vämanadeva then visited the sacrificial arena on the northern side of the Narmadä River, at the field known as Bhågukaccha, where brähmaëas of the Bhågu dynasty were performing yajïas. Wearing a belt made of muïja straw, an upper garment of deerskin and a sacred thread and carrying in His hands a daëòa, an umbrella and a waterpot (kamaëòalu), Lord Vämanadeva appeared in the sacrificial arena of Mahäräja Bali. Because of His transcendentally effulgent presence, all the priests were diminished in their prowess, and thus they all stood from their seats and offered prayers to Lord Vämanadeva. Even Lord Çiva accepts on his head the Ganges water generated from the toe of Lord Vämanadeva. Therefore, after washing the Lord's feet, Bali Mahäräja immediately accepted the water from the Lord's feet on his head and felt that he and his predecessors had certainly been glorified. Then Bali Mahäräja inquired of Lord Vämanadeva's welfare and requested the Lord to ask him for money, jewels or anything He might desire."
