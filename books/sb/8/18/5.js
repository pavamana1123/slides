    "translation": "On the day of Çravaëa-dvädaçé [the twelfth day of the bright fortnight in the month of Bhädra], when the moon came into the lunar mansion Çravaëa, at the auspicious moment of Abhijit, the Lord appeared in this universe. Considering the Lord's appearance very auspicious, all the stars and planets, from the sun to Saturn, were munificently charitable.",

            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, an expert astrologer, explains the word nakñatra-tärädyäù. The word nakñatra means \"the stars,\" the word tära in this context refers to the planets, and ädyäù means \"the first one specifically mentioned.\" Among the planets, the first is Sürya, the sun, not the moon. Therefore, according to the Vedic version, the modern astronomer's proposition that the moon is nearest to the earth should not be accepted. The chronological order in which people all over the world refer to the days of the week—Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday—corresponds to the Vedic order of the planets and thus circumstantiates the Vedic version. Apart from this, when the Lord appeared the planets and stars became situated very auspiciously, according to astrological calculations, to celebrate the birth of the Lord."
