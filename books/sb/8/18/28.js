    "translation": "Lord Çiva, the best of demigods, who carries on his forehead the emblem of the moon, receives on his head with great devotion the Ganges water emanating from the toe of Viñëu. Being aware of religious principles, Bali Mahäräja knew this. Consequently, following in the footsteps of Lord Çiva, he also placed on his head the water that had washed the Lord's lotus feet.",

            "content": "Lord Çiva is known as Gaìgä-dhara, or one who carries the water of the Ganges on his head. On Lord Çiva's forehead is the emblem of the half-moon, yet to give supreme respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Çiva placed the water of the Ganges above this emblem. This example should be followed by everyone, or at least by every devotee, because Lord Çiva is one of the mahäjanas. Similarly, Mahäräja Bali also later became a mahäjana. One mahäjana follows another mahäjana, and by following the paramparä system of mahäjana activities one can become advanced in spiritual consciousness. The water of the Ganges is sanctified because it emanates from the toe of Lord Viñëu. Bali Mahäräja washed the lotus feet of Vämanadeva, and the water with which he did so became equal to the Ganges. Bali Mahäräja, who perfectly knew all religious principles, therefore took that water on his head, following in the footsteps of Lord Çiva."
