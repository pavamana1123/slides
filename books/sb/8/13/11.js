Each Manu lives for seventy-one yugas, and fourteen such Manus rule in one day of Lord Brahmä. We are now in the period of Vaivasvata Manu, the seventh Manu, and the eighth Manu will come into existence after many millions of years. But Çukadeva Gosvämé, having heard from authorities, foretells that the eighth Manu will be Sävarëi and that Nirmoka and Virajaska will be among his sons. Çästra can foretell what will happen millions and millions of years in the future."
