I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who are the shelter of the Vedic knowledge contained in the çästras like the Païcarätras and Vedänta-sütra, which are Your representations, and who are the source of the paramparä system. Because it is You who can give liberation, You are the only shelter for all transcendentalists. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",

He is wonderful in the sense that although there may be unlimited emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead (janmädy asya yataù ). In our experience in the material world, if we have a bank balance of one million dollars, as we withdraw money from the bank the balance gradually diminishes until it becomes nil. However, the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is so complete that although innumerable Personalities of Godhead expand from Him, He remains the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. Pürëasya pürëam ädäya pürëam evävaçiñyate. Therefore He is the wonderful cause. Govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi."
