As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä . Because the conditioned soul wants to forget You, by Your grace You give him opportunities, life after life, by which he can almost perpetually forget You. Therefore You are eternally the director of the conditioned souls. It is because You are the original cause of everything that everything appears real. The ultimate reality is Your Lordship, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.\""

            "content": "The word sarva-pratyaya-hetave is explained by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, who says that a result gives one a glimpse of its cause. For example, since an earthen pot is the result of the actions of a potter, by seeing the earthen pot one can guess at the existence of the potter. Similarly, this material world resembles the spiritual world, and any intelligent person can guess how it is acting. As explained in Bhagavad-gétä, mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram . The activities of the material world suggest that behind them is the superintendence of the Lord."
