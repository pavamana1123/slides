    "translation": "An artist onstage, being covered by attractive dresses and dancing with different movements, is not understood by his audience; similarly, the activities and features of the supreme artist cannot be understood even by the demigods or great sages, and certainly not by those who are unintelligent like animals. Neither the demigods and sages nor the unintelligent can understand the features of the Lord, nor can they express in words His actual position. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead give me protection.",

Nonetheless, even great yogés, demigods, saints and sages have been unable to understand the bodily features of that great artist, nor could they understand the meaning of His movements. What then is to be said of ordinary speculators like the so-called philosophers of this material world? For them He is impossible to understand. Therefore we must accept the statements given by the Supreme when He kindly incarnates to instruct us. We must simply accept the word of Lord Rämacandra, Lord Kåñëa and Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and follow in Their footsteps. Then it may be possible for us to know the purpose of Their incarnations."

The material body will no longer have any function, and whatever activities take place with the body will be activities of Kåñëa consciousness. In this way one may give up his body and return home, back to Godhead."
