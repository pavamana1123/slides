    "translation": "Gajendra had been forcefully captured by the crocodile in the water and was feeling acute pain, but when he saw that Näräyaëa, wielding His disc, was coming in the sky on the back of Garuòa, he immediately took a lotus flower in his trunk, and with great difficulty due to his painful condition, he uttered the following words: \"O my Lord, Näräyaëa, master of the universe, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.\"",

            "content": "The King of the elephants was so very eager to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead that when he saw the Lord coming in the sky, with great pain and in a feeble voice he offered respect to the Lord. A devotee does not consider a dangerous position to be dangerous, for in such a dangerous position he can fervently pray to the Lord in great ecstasy. Thus a devotee regards danger as a good opportunity. Tat te'nukampäà susamékñamäëaù. When a devotee is in great danger, he sees that danger to be the great mercy of the Lord because it is an opportunity to think of the Lord very sincerely and with undiverted attention. Tat te 'nukampäà susamékñamäëo bhuïjäna evätma-kåtaà vipäkam . He does not accuse the Supreme Personality of Godhead for having let His devotee fall into such a dangerous condition. Rather, he considers that dangerous condition to be due to his past misdeeds and takes it as an opportunity to pray to the Lord and offer thanks for having been given such an opportunity. When a devotee lives in this way, his salvation—his going back home, back to Godhead—is guaranteed. We can see this to be true from the example of Gajendra, who anxiously prayed to the Lord and thus received an immediate chance to return home, back to Godhead."
