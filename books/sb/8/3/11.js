If one wants to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead in truth, one must take to the activities of devotional service. These activities are called sattva or çuddha-sattva. In the material world, activities of goodness, which are symptomatic of a pure brähmaëa, are appreciated. But the activities of devotional service are çuddha-sattva; in other words, they are on the transcendental platform. Only by devotional service can one understand the Supreme."

Unless one performs activities with reference to Kåñëa consciousness, cessation of material activities will not be helpful. In hopes of achieving naiñkarmya, freedom from material action, many highly elevated sannyäsés stopped their activities, yet they failed and returned to the material platform to act as materialistic persons. But once one is engaged in the spiritual activities of bhakti-yoga, one does not fall down. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore an attempt to engage everyone always in spiritual activity, by which one becomes transcendental to material actions. The spiritual activities of bhakti-märga-çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù smaraëaà päda-sevanam —lead one to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

By such transcendental devotional service, the Lord is served. I offer my respectful obeisances unto Him."
