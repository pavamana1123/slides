    "translation": "My Lord, those who are completely freed from material contamination always meditate upon You within the cores of their hearts. You are extremely difficult to attain for those like me who are too attached to mental concoction, home, relatives, friends, money, servants and assistants. You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, uncontaminated by the modes of nature. You are the reservoir of all enlightenment, the supreme controller. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",

Apäpa-viddham: He is not contaminated. This same fact is described here. Guëa-saìga-vivarjitäya. Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears as an incarnation within this material world, He is unaffected by the modes of material nature. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà tanum äçritam: foolish men with insufficient knowledge deride the Personality of Godhead because He appears just like a human being. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be understood only by the muktätmä, the liberated soul. Muktätmabhiù sva-hådaye paribhävitäya: only the liberated person can constantly think of Kåñëa. Such a person is the greatest of all yogés."
