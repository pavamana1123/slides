As explained later, Gajendra was formerly King Indradyumna, and somehow or other in his next life he became King of the elephants. Now Gajendra was in danger, and although he was in a body other than that of a human being, he remembered the stotra he had chanted in his previous life. Yatate ca tato bhüyaù saàsiddhau kuru-nandana. To enable one to achieve perfection, Kåñëa gives one the chance to remember Him again. This is proved here, for although the King of the elephants, Gajendra, was put in danger, this was a chance for him to remember his previous devotional activities so that he could immediately be rescued by the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

            "content": "It is imperative, therefore, that all devotees in Kåñëa consciousness practice chanting some mantra. Certainly one should chant the Hare Kåñëa mantra, which is the mahä-mantra, or great mantra, and also one should practice chanting cintämaëi-prakara-sadmasu or the Nåsiàha strotra (ito nåsiàhaù parato nåsiàho yato yato yämi tato nåsiàhaù). Every devotee should practice in order to chant some mantra perfectly so that even though he may be imperfect in spiritual consciousness in this life, in his next life he will not forget Kåñëa consciousness, even if he becomes an animal. Of course, a devotee should try to perfect his Kåñëa consciousness in this life, for simply by understanding Kåñëa and His instructions, after giving up this body one can return home, back to Godhead. Even if there is some falldown, practice of Kåñëa consciousness never goes in vain. For example, Ajämila, in his boyhood, practiced chanting the name of Näräyaëa under the direction of his father, but later, in his youth, he fell down and became a drunkard, woman-hunter, rogue and thief. Nonetheless, because of chanting the name of Näräyaëa for the purpose of calling his son, whom he had named Näräyaëa, he became advanced, even though he was involved in sinful activities. Therefore, we should not forget the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra under any circumstances. It will help us in the greatest danger, as we find in the life of Gajendra."
