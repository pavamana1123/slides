There are many tattvas, such as viñëu-tattva, jéva-tattva and çakti-tattva, but above everything is the viñëu-tattva, which is all-pervading.

The Lord enters every universe as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and then expands Himself as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu to enter the hearts of all living entities and even enter the atoms. Aëòäntara-stha-paramäëu-cayäntara-stham (BS 5.35). Every universe is full of atoms, and the Lord is not only within the universe but also within the atoms. Thus within every atom the Supreme Lord exists in His Viñëu feature as Paramätmä, but all the viñëu-tattvas emanate from Kåñëa. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä  there is no personality superior to Kåñëa. Therefore Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says that bhagavate båhate means \"unto Çré Kåñëa.\""
