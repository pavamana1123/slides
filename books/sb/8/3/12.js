    "translation": "I offer my respectful obeisances to Lord Väsudeva, who is all-pervading, to the Lord's fierce form as Lord Nåsiàhadeva, to the Lord's form as an animal [Lord Varähadeva], to Lord Dattätreya, who preached impersonalism, to Lord Buddha, and to all the other incarnations. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who has no material qualities but who accepts the three qualities goodness, passion and ignorance within this material world. I also offer my respectful obeisances unto the impersonal Brahman effulgence.",

As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, there are so many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that they are like the waves of a river. The waves of a river flow incessantly, and no one can count how many waves there are. Similarly, no one can calculate when and how the different incarnations of the Lord appear according to the necessities of time, place and candidates. The Lord appears perpetually. As Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä :"

            "content": "Even impersonalists who stress the knowledge feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead want to merge in the effulgence of the Lord. Therefore, here the word jïäna-ghanäya indicates that for atheists who disbelieve in the form and existence of the Lord, all these various incarnations appear. Since the Lord comes to teach in so many forms, no one can say that there is no God. The word jïäna-ghanäya is especially used here to refer to those whose knowledge has become solidified by dint of their searching for the Lord through speculative philosophical understanding. Superficial knowledge is useless for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when one's knowledge becomes extremely intense and deep, one understands Väsudeva (väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù ). A jïäné attains this stage after many, many births. Therefore the word jïäna-ghanäya is used here. The word çantäya indicates that Lord Väsudeva is situated in everyone's heart but does not act with the living entity. Impersonalist jïänés realize Väsudeva when they are fully mature in knowledge (väsudevaù samam iti sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù)."
