    "translation": "The King of the elephants, Gajendra, said: I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Person, Väsudeva [oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya]. Because of Him this material body acts due to the presence of spirit, and He is therefore the root cause of everyone. He is worshipable for such exalted persons as Brahmä and Çiva, and He has entered the heart of every living being. Let me meditate upon Him.",

            "content": "In this verse the words etac cid-ätmakam are very important. The material body certainly consists only of material elements, but when one awakens to Kåñëa conscious understanding, the body is no longer material but spiritual. The material body is meant for sense enjoyment, whereas the spiritual body engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Therefore, a devotee who engages in the service of the Supreme Lord and who constantly thinks of Him should never be considered to have a material body. It is therefore enjoined, guruñu nara-matiù: one should stop thinking of the spiritual master as an ordinary human being with a material body. Arcye viñëau çilä-dhéù: everyone knows that the Deity in the temple is made of stone, but to think that the Deity is merely stone is an offense. Similarly, to think that the body of the spiritual master consists of material ingredients is offensive. Atheists think that devotees foolishly worship a stone statue as God and an ordinary man as the guru. The fact is, however, that by the grace of Kåñëa's omnipotence, the so-called stone statue of the Deity is directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the body of the spiritual master is directly spiritual. A pure devotee who is engaged in unalloyed devotional service should be understood to be situated on the transcendental platform (sa guëän samatétyaitän brahma-bhüyäya kalpate ). Let us therefore offer our obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by whose mercy so-called material things also become spiritual when they are engaged in spiritual activity."

            "content": "Oàkära (praëava) is the symbolic sound representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Oà tat sad iti nirdeço brahmaëas tri-vidhaù småtaù: the three words oà tat sat immediately invoke the Supreme Person. Therefore Kåñëa says that He is oàkära in all the Vedic mantras (praëavaù sarva-vedeñu). The Vedic mantras are pronounced beginning with oàkära to indicate immediately the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çrémad-Bhägavatam, for example, begins with the words oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya. There is no difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva, and oàkära (praëava). We should be careful to understand that oàkära does not indicate anything niräkära, or formless. Indeed, this verse immediately says, oà namo bhagavate. Bhagavän is a person. Thus oàkära is the representation of the Supreme Person. Oàkära is not meant to be impersonal, as the Mäyävädé philosophers consider it to be. This is distinctly expressed here by the word puruñäya. The supreme truth addressed by oàkära is puruña, the Supreme Person; He is not impersonal. Unless He is a person, how can He control the great, stalwart controllers of this universe? Lord Viñëu, Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva are the supreme controllers of this universe, but Lord Viñëu is offered obeisances even by Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä. Therefore this verse uses the word pareçäya, which indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by exalted demigods. Pareçäya means parameçvara. Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva are éçvaras, great controllers, but Lord Viñëu is parameçvara, the supreme controller."
