    "translation": "Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: When the King of the elephants was describing the supreme authority, without mentioning any particular person, he did not invoke the demigods, headed by Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva, Indra and Candra. Thus none of them approached him. However, because Lord Hari is the Supersoul, Puruñottama, the Personality of Godhead, He appeared before Gajendra.",

            "content": "From the description of Gajendra, he apparently was aiming at the supreme authority although he did not know who the supreme authority is. He conjectured, \"There is a supreme authority who is above everything.\" Under the circumstances, the Lord's various expansions, such as Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva, Candra and Indra, all thought, \"Gajendra is not asking our help. He is asking the help of the Supreme, who is above all of us.\" As Gajendra has described, the Supreme Lord has various parts and parcels, including the demigods, human beings and animals, all covered by separate forms. Although the demigods are in charge of maintaining different aspects of the universe, Gajendra thought that they were unable to rescue him. Harià vinä naiva måtià taranti: no one can rescue anyone from the dangers of birth, death, old age and disease. It is only the Supreme Personality of Godhead who can rescue one from the dangers of material existence. Therefore an intelligent person, to get free from this dangerous existence, approaches the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not any demigod. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä , kämais tais tair håta jïänäù prapadyante 'nya-devatäù: those who are unintelligent approach the various demigods for temporary material benefits. Actually, however, these demigods cannot rescue the living entity from the dangers of material existence. Like other living entities, the demigods are merely external parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's transcendental body. As stated in the Vedic mantras, sa ätma-aìgäny anyä devatäù. Within the body is the ätmä, the soul, whereas the various parts of the body like the hands and legs are external. Similarly, the ätmä of the entire cosmic manifestation is Näräyaëa, Lord Viñëu, and all the demigods, human beings and other living entities are parts of His body."

Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very difficult to approach, He is very near to us because He lives within our hearts. As soon as the Lord understands that one is seeking His favor by fully surrendering, naturally He immediately takes action. Therefore although the demigods did not come to the aid of Gajendra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead immediately appeared before him because of his fervent prayer. This does not mean that the demigods were angry with Gajendra, for actually when Lord Viñëu is worshiped, all the other demigods are also worshiped. Yasmin tuñöe jagat tuñöam: if the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied, everyone is satisfied."
