There are many varieties of philosophers trying to search for the ultimate cause under different names and forms, but they are unable to find the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, who explains in Bhagavad-gétä that He is the origin of everything and the cause of all causes (ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù ). This inability is due to the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord. Devotees, therefore, accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is and remain happy simply by chanting the glories of the Lord."
