The duty of human society, therefore, is to accept the path of action enunciated by the Supreme Lord. In the present age, the sum and substance of all Vedic knowledge is to be found in Bhagavad-gétä, which is personally taught by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the same Supreme Godhead, assuming the form of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, expands the teachings of Bhagavad-gétä all over the world. In other words, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, is so kind and merciful to human society that He is always anxious to take the fallen souls back home, back to Godhead."
