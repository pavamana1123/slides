The rulers of the world in the line of hierarchy execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the paramparä system. Anyone interested in peaceful life must participate in this paramparä system and perform yajïas. As Gauòéya Vaiñëavas in the paramparä system of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, we must perform saìkértana-yajïa all over the world (yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù ). Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this age of Kali, and He will be easily satisfied if the saìkértana movement is spread vigorously all over the world. This will also make people happy without a doubt."
