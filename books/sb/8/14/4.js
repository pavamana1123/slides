            "content": "In this verse, the words dharmaù and sanätanaù are very important. Sanätana means \"eternal,\" and dharma means \"occupational duties.\" From Satya-yuga to Kali-yuga, the principles of religion and occupational duty gradually deteriorate. In Satya-yuga, the religious principles are observed in full, without deviation. In Tretä-yuga, however, these principles are somewhat neglected, and only three fourths of the religious duties continue. In Dväpara-yuga only half of the religious principles continue, and in Kali-yuga only one fourth of the religious principles, which gradually disappear. At the end of Kali-yuga, the principles of religion, or the occupational duties of humanity, are almost lost. Indeed, in this Kali-yuga we have passed through only five thousand years, yet the decline of sanätana-dharma is very prominent. The duty of saintly persons, therefore, is to take up seriously the cause of sanätana-dharma and try to reestablish it for the benefit of the entire human society. The Kåñëa consciousness movement has been started according to this principle. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

Therefore, following in the footsteps of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who five hundred years ago inaugurated the movement of saìkértana, kåñëa-kértana, we are trying to introduce this movement, according to superior orders, all over the world. Now, if the inaugurators of this movement strictly follow the regulative principles and spread this movement for the benefit of all human society, they will certainly usher in a new way of life by reestablishing sanätana-dharma, the eternal occupational duties of humanity. The eternal occupational duty of the human being is to serve Kåñëa. Jévera 'svarüpa' haya-kåñëera 'nitya-däsa.' . This is the purport of sanätana-dharma. Sanätana means nitya, or \"eternal,\" and kåñëa-däsa means \"servant of Kåñëa.\" The eternal occupational duty of the human being is to serve Kåñëa. This is the sum and substance of the Kåñëa consciousness movement."
