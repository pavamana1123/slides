Following the same process, the Kåñëa consciousness movement is teaching the principles of Bhagavad-gétä as it is, without deviation, all over the world. If the fortunate people of this time accept the instructions of Lord Kåñëa, they will certainly be happy in Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu's mission. Caitanya Mahäprabhu wanted everyone, at least in India, to become a preacher of this mission. In other words, one should become a guru and preach the Lord's instructions all over the world for the peace and prosperity of humanity."
