The demons, however, being captivated by Mohiné-mürti's bodily features, took Her words as a joke and confidently delivered the container of nectar into Her hands. Thus Mohiné-mürti resembles Lord Buddha, who appeared sammohäya sura-dviñäm —to cheat the asuras. The word sura-dviñäm refers to those who are envious of the demigods or devotees. Sometimes an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead cheats the atheists. Thus we see here that although Mohiné-mürti was speaking factually to the asuras, the asuras took Her words to be facetious. Indeed, they were so confident of Mohiné-mürti's honesty that they immediately delivered the container of nectar into Her hands, as if they would allow Her to do with the nectar whatever She liked, whether She distributed it, threw it away or drank it Herself without giving it to them."
