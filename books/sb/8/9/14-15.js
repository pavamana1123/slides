After bathing, they offered clarified butter and oblations into the fire and gave charity to the cows and to the brähmaëas and members of the other orders of society, namely the kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras, who were all rewarded as they deserved. Thereafter, the demigods and demons performed ritualistic ceremonies under the directions of the brähmaëas. Then they dressed themselves with new garments according to their own choice, decorated their bodies with ornaments, and sat facing east on seats made of kuça grass.",

            "content": "The Vedas enjoin that for every ritualistic ceremony one must first become clean by bathing either in the water of the Ganges or Yamunä or in the sea. Then one may perform the ritualistic ceremony and offer clarified butter into the fire. In this verse the words paridhäya ähatäni are especially significant. A sannyäsé or a person about to perform a ritualistic ceremony should not dress himself in clothing sewn with a needle."
