    "translation": "The place, the time, the cause, the purpose, the activity and the ambition were all the same for both the demigods and the demons, but the demigods achieved one result and the demons another. Because the demigods are always under the shelter of the dust of the Lord's lotus feet, they could very easily drink the nectar and get its result. The demons, however, not having sought shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, were unable to achieve the result they desired.",

One who works for Lord Viñëu is free from this material world, and after giving up his body he goes back home, back to Godhead. A karmé, however, although externally working like a devotee, is entangled in his nondevotional activity, and thus he suffers the tribulations of material existence. Thus from the results achieved by the karmés and devotees, one can understand the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who acts differently for the karmés and jïänés than for the devotees. The author of Çré Caitanya-caritämåta therefore says:"

But the devotee, who does not expect any personal benefit and whose only ambition is to spread the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is blessed with all the auspicious results of bhakti-yoga, without hard labor."
