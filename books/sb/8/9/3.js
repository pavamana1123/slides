In regard to this inquiry, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says that the question \"To whom do You belong?\" means \"Whose daughter are You?\" Since the demons could understand that the beautiful girl was still unmarried, every one of them desired to marry Her. Thus they inquired, \"Whose daughter are You?\""
