For them the heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same, for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord.\" ). Vämanadeva asked Bali Mahäräja to go to the hellish planets, apparently just to show the entire universe how tolerant he was, and Bali Mahäräja did not hesitate to carry out the order. A devotee does not live alone. Of course, everyone lives with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because the devotee is engaged in His service, he actually does not live in any material condition. Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, kéöa janma hao yathä tuyä däsa. Thus he prays to take birth as an insignificant insect in the association of devotees. Because devotees are engaged in the service of the Lord, anyone who lives with them also lives in Vaikuëöha."
