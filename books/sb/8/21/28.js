But although Bali Mahäräja had lost everything, he was fixed in his determination to satisfy Vämanadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gétä, such a person is called sthita-prajïa. A pure devotee is never deviated from the service of the Lord, despite all difficulties and impediments offered by the illusory energy. Generally men who have wealth and opulence are famous, but Bali Mahäräja became famous for all time by being deprived of all his possessions. This is the special mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead toward His devotees. The Lord says, yasyäham anugåhëämi hariñye tad-dhanaà çanaiù . As the first installment of His special favor, the Lord takes away all the possessions of His devotee. A devotee, however, is never disturbed by such a loss. He continues his service, and the Lord amply rewards him, beyond the expectations of any common man."
