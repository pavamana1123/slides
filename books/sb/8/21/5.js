Thus He acted exactly like Lord Kåñëa, who, at the request of Arjuna, first showed His universal form and later resumed His original form as Kåñëa. The Lord can assume any form He likes, but His original form is that of Kåñëa (kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam ). According to the capacity of the devotee, the Lord assumes various forms so that the devotee can handle Him. This is His causeless mercy. When Lord Vämanadeva resumed His original form, Lord Brahmä and his associates collected various paraphernalia for worship with which to please Him."
