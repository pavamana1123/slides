            "content": "With the second step the Supreme Personality of Godhead reached the topmost planet of the universe, Brahmaloka, which He diminished in beauty by the effulgence of His toenails. Thus Lord Brahmä, accompanied by great sages like Maréci and the predominating deities of all the higher planets, offered humble prayers and worship to the Lord. They washed the Lord's feet and worshiped Him with all paraphernalia. Åkñaräja, Jämbavän, played his bugle to vibrate the glories of the Lord. When Bali Mahäräja was deprived of all his possessions, the demons were very angry. Although Bali Mahäräja warned them not to do so, they took up weapons against Lord Viñëu. All of them were defeated, however, by Lord Viñëu's eternal associates, and, in accordance with Bali Mahäräja's order, they all entered the lower planets of the universe. Understanding Lord Viñëu's purpose, Garuòa, the carrier of Lord Viñëu, immediately arrested Bali Mahäräja with the ropes of Varuëa. When Bali Mahäräja was thus reduced to a helpless position, Lord Viñëu asked him for the third step of land. Because Lord Viñëu appreciated Bali Mahäräja's determination and integrity, when Bali Mahäräja was unable to fulfill his promise, Lord Viñëu ascertained that the place for him would be the planet Sutala, which is better than the planets of heaven."
