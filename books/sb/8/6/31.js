The demigods went to Bali Mahäräja with the proposal to manufacture nectar, and the Daityas, the demons, immediately accepted it, thinking that since the demigods were already weak, when the nectar was produced the demons would take it from them and use it for their own purposes. The demigods, of course, had similar intentions. The only difference is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viñëu, was on the side of the demigods because the demigods were His devotees, whereas the demons did not care about Lord Viñëu. All over the universe there are two parties—the Viñëu party, or God-conscious party, and the godless party. The godless party is never happy or victorious, but the God-conscious party is always happy and victorious."
