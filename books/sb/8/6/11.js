By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.\" The material energy creates, maintains and devastates the entire cosmic manifestation because of directions given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who enters this universe as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu but is untouched by the material qualities. In Bhagavad-gétä the Lord refers to mäyä, the external energy, which creates this material world, as mama mäyä, \"My energy,\" because this energy works under the full control of the Lord. These facts can be realized only by those who are well versed in Vedic knowledge and advanced in Kåñëa consciousness."
