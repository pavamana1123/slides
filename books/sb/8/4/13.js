    "translation": "Upon delivering the King of the elephants from the clutches of the crocodile, and from material existence, which resembles a crocodile, the Lord awarded him the status of särüpya-mukti. In the presence of the Gandharvas, the Siddhas and the other demigods, who were praising the Lord for His wonderful transcendental activities, the Lord, sitting on the back of His carrier, Garuòa, returned to His all-wonderful abode and took Gajendra with Him.",

The impersonalists are satisfied to get the liberation of merging in the Brahman effulgence, but for a devotee, mukti (liberation) means not to merge in the effulgence of the Lord, but to be directly promoted to the Vaikuëöha planets and to become an associate of the Lord. In this regard, there is a relevant verse in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

The word däya-bhäk refers to a hereditary right to the Lord's mercy. A devotee must simply engage in devotional service, not caring about material situations. Then he automatically becomes a rightful candidate for promotion to Vaikuëöhaloka. The devotee who renders unalloyed service to the Lord gets the right to be promoted to Vaikuëöhaloka, just as a son inherits the property of his father."

            "content": "When a devotee gets liberation, he becomes free from material contamination and engages as a servant of the Lord. This is explained in Çrémad-Bhägavatam . Although the impersonalist rises to the Brahman effulgence and enters into that effulgence, he has no engagement in the service of the Lord, and therefore he is again attracted to materialistic philanthropic activities. Thus he comes down to open hospitals and educational institutions, feed poor men and perform similar materialistic activities, which the impersonalist thinks are more precious than serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù. The impersonalists do not think that the service of the Lord is more valuable than serving the poor man or starting a school or hospital. Although they say brahma satyaà jagan mithyä—\"Brahman is real, and the material world is false\"—they are nonetheless very eager to serve the false material world and neglect the service of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
