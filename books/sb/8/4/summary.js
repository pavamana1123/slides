Once this King Hühü was enjoying with women in the water, and while enjoying he pulled the leg of Devala Åñi, who was also taking a bath in the water. Upon this, the sage became very angry and immediately cursed him to become a crocodile. King Hühü was very sorry when cursed in that way, and he begged pardon from the sage, who in compassion gave him the benediction that he would be freed when Gajendra was delivered by the Personality of Godhead. Thus the crocodile was delivered when killed by Näräyaëa."

            "content": "When Gajendra, by the mercy of the Lord, became one of the Lord's associates in Vaikuëöha, he got four hands. This achievement is called särüpya-mukti, or the liberation of receiving a spiritual body exactly like that of Näräyaëa. Gajendra, in his previous birth, had been a great devotee of Lord Viñëu. His name was Indradyumna, and he was the King of the Tämila country. Following the Vedic principles, this King retired from family life and constructed a small cottage in the Malayäcala Hills, where he always worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead in silence. Agastya Åñi, along with many disciples, once approached King Indradyumna's äçrama, but because the King was meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he could not receive Agastya Åñi properly. Thus the åñi became very angry and cursed the King to become a dull elephant. In accordance with this curse, the King was born as an elephant, and he forgot all about his previous activities in devotional service. Nonetheless, in his birth as an elephant, when he was dangerously attacked by the crocodile, he remembered his past life in devotional service and remembered a prayer he had learned in that life. Because of this prayer, he again received the mercy of the Lord. Thus he was immediately delivered, and he became one of the Lord's four-handed associates."

Çukadeva Gosvämé says that by hearing the narration of Gajendra's deliverance, one can also get the opportunity to be delivered. Çukadeva Gosvämé vividly describes this, and thus the chapter ends."
