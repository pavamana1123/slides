She strictly followed the instructions of her husband and guru. As confirmed in the Vedic injunctions, yasya deve parä bhaktir yathä deve tathä gurau [ÇU 6.23]. One should have complete faith in the guru, who helps the disciple make progress in spiritual life. As soon as the disciple thinks independently, not caring for the instructions of the spiritual master, he is a failure (yasyäprasädän na gatiù kuto 'pi). Aditi very strictly followed the instructions of her husband and spiritual master, and thus she was successful."
