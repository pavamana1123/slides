That is called pure devotional service.\" One simply has to concentrate upon the lotus feet of Väsudeva, Kåñëa (sa vai manaù kåñëa-padäravindayoù ). Then the mind and senses will be controlled, and one can engage himself fully in the devotional service of the Lord. The devotee does not need to practice the haöha-yoga system to control the mind and senses; his mind and senses are automatically controlled because of unalloyed devotional service to the Lord."
