Some fought on the backs of timiìgilas, which can devour huge whales, some on the backs of çarabhas, and some on buffalo, rhinoceroses, cows, bulls, jungle cows and aruëas. Others fought on the backs of jackals, rats, lizards, rabbits, human beings, goats, black deer, swans and boars. In this way, mounted on animals of the water, land and sky, including animals with deformed bodies, both armies faced each other and went forward.",
