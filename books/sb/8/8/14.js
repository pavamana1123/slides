    "translation": "Thereafter, the great elephants from all the directions carried big water jugs full of Ganges water and bathed the goddess of fortune, to the accompaniment of Vedic mantras chanted by learned brähmaëas. While thus being bathed, the goddess of fortune maintained her original style, with a lotus flower in her hand, and she appeared very beautiful. The goddess of fortune is the most chaste, for she does not know anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

These opulences are received from the goddess of fortune. Lakñmé is addressed here as devé, the goddess, because in Vaikuëöha she supplies all opulences to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees, who in this way enjoy natural life in the Vaikuëöha planets. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased with His consort, the goddess of fortune, who carries a lotus flower in her hand. Mother Lakñmé is described in this verse as saté, the supremely chaste, because she never diverts her attention from the Supreme Personality of Godhead to anyone else."
