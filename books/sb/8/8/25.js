    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the father of the three worlds, and His bosom is the residence of mother Lakñmé, the goddess of fortune, the proprietor of all opulences. The goddess of fortune, by her favorable and merciful glance, can increase the opulence of the three worlds, along with their inhabitants and their directors, the demigods.",

In other words, since the goddess of fortune stays on the bosom of Näräyaëa, she naturally sees any devotee who worships Näräyaëa. When the goddess of fortune understands that a devotee is in favor of devotional service to Näräyaëa, she is naturally inclined to bless the devotee with all opulences. The karmés try to receive the favor and mercy of Lakñmé, but because they are not devotees of Näräyaëa, their opulence is flickering. The opulence of devotees who are attached to the service of Näräyaëa is not like the opulence of karmés. The opulence of devotees is as permanent as the opulence of Näräyaëa Himself."
