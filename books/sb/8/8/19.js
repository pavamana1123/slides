    "translation": "While walking among the Gandharvas, Yakñas, asuras, Siddhas, Cäraëas and denizens of heaven, Lakñmédevé, the goddess of fortune, was scrutinizingly examining them, but she could not find anyone naturally endowed with all good qualities. None of them was devoid of faults, and therefore she could not take shelter of any of them.",

Thus she was allowed to select her own husband in a svayaàvara ceremony. She examined every one of the candidates, but she could not find anyone suitably qualified to be her shelter. In other words, Näräyaëa, the natural husband of Lakñmé, cannot be superseded by anyone in this material world."
