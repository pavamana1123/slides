    "translation": "The goddess of fortune, examining the assembly, thought in this way: Someone who has undergone great austerity has not yet conquered anger. Someone possesses knowledge, but he has not conquered material desires. Someone is a very great personality, but he cannot conquer lusty desires. Even a great personality depends on something else. How, then, can he be the supreme controller?",

For example, one may have undergone severe austerities but still be under the control of anger. By a scrutinizing analysis, we find that everyone is controlled by something else. No one, therefore, can be the true controller but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. This is supported by the çästras. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù: (BS 5.1) the supreme controller is Kåñëa. Kåñëa is never controlled by anyone, for He is the controller of everyone (sarva-käraëa-käraëam)."
