    "translation": "Someone may possess full knowledge of religion but still not be kind to all living entities. In someone, whether human or demigod, there may be renunciation, but that is not the cause of liberation. Someone may possess great power and yet be unable to check the power of eternal time. Someone else may have renounced attachment to the material world, yet he cannot compare to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, no one is completely freed from the influence of the material modes of nature.",

We actually see that there are many Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and religionists of other cults who adhere to their religious principles very nicely but are not equal to all living entities. Indeed, although they profess to be very religious, they kill poor animals. Such religion has no meaning. Çrémad-Bhägavatam  says:"

One must develop a sense of loving Väsudeva (väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù ). A devotee will never allow a poor animal to be killed in the name of religion. This is the difference between a superficially religious person and a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Even the greatest hero cannot escape from the ruling power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead when Kåñëa comes as death. That is described by Kåñëa Himself: måtyuù sarva-haraç cäham . The Lord, appearing as death, takes away a hero's so-called power. Even Hiraëyakaçipu could not be saved when Nåsiàhadeva appeared before him as death. One's material strength is nothing before the strength of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
