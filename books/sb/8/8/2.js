    "translation": "O King Parékñit, great sages who were completely aware of the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies took charge of that surabhi cow, which produced all the yogurt, milk and ghee absolutely necessary for offering oblations into the fire. They did this just for the sake of pure ghee, which they wanted for the performance of sacrifices to elevate themselves to the higher planetary systems, up to Brahmaloka.",

As described in Brahma-saàhitä, Lord Kåñëa, on His planet, Goloka Våndävana, engages in tending the surabhi cows (surabhér abhipälayantam (BS 5.29)). These cows are the Lord's pet animals. From the surabhi cows one can take as much milk as one needs, and one may milk these cows as many times as he desires. In other words, the surabhi cow can yield milk unlimitedly. Milk is necessary for the performance of yajïa. Sages know how to use milk to elevate human society to the perfection of life. Since cow protection is recommended everywhere in the çästras, the brahmä vädés took charge of the surabhi cow, in which the demons were not very interested."
