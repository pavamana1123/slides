    "translation": "O lord, you are the cause of bondage and liberation of the entire universe because you are its ruler. Those who are advanced in spiritual consciousness surrender unto you, and therefore you are the cause of mitigating their distresses, and you are also the cause of their liberation. We therefore worship Your Lordship.",

They did so because Lord Viñëu acts through Lord Çiva in the creation of the material world. Lord Çiva acts on behalf of Lord Viñëu. When the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä  that He is the father of all living entities (ahaà béja-pradaù pitä), this refers to actions performed by Lord Viñëu through Lord Çiva. Lord Viñëu is always unattached to material activities, and when material activities are to be performed, Lord Viñëu performs them through Lord Çiva. Lord Çiva is therefore worshiped on the level of Lord Viñëu. When Lord Viñëu is untouched by the external energy He is Lord Viñëu, but when He is in touch with the external energy, He appears in His feature as Lord Çiva."
