Otherwise, he would have no business teaching them how to become happy. In materialistic life, people must certainly engage in activities of animosity. Materialistic life is therefore compared to saàsära-dävänala, a blazing forest fire that automatically takes place. Lord Çiva and his followers in the paramparä system try to save people from this dangerous condition of materialistic life. This is the duty of devotees following the principles of Lord Çiva and belonging to the Rudra-sampradäya. There are four Vaiñëava sampradäyas, and the Rudra-sampradäya is one of them because Lord Çiva (Rudra) is the best of the Vaiñëavas (vaiñëavänäà yathä çambhuù). Indeed, as we shall see, Lord Çiva drank all the poison for the benefit of humanity."
