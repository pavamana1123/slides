    "translation": "When annihilation is performed by the flames and sparks emanating from your eyes, the entire creation is burned to ashes. Nonetheless, you do not know how this happens. What then is to be said of your destroying the Dakña-yajïa, Tripuräsura and the kälaküöa poison? Such activities cannot be subject matters for prayers offered to you.",

The demigods indirectly prayed that Lord Çiva counteract the kälaküöa poison, which was spreading throughout the universe."
