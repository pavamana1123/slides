The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä , ya idaà paramaà guhyaà mad-bhakteñv abhidhäsyati. .. na ca tasmän manuñyeñu kaçcin me priya-kåttamaù: \"One who preaches the message of Bhagavad-gétä to My devotees is most dear to Me. No one can excel him in satisfying Me by worship.\" There are different kinds of welfare activities in this material world, but the supreme welfare activity is the spreading of Kåñëa consciousness. Other welfare activities cannot be effective, for the laws of nature and the results of karma cannot be checked. It is by destiny, or the laws of karma, that one must suffer or enjoy. For instance, if one is given a court order, he must accept it, whether it brings suffering or profit. Similarly, everyone is under obligations to karma and it reactions. No one can change this. Therefore the çästra says:"

            "content": "One should endeavor for that which is never obtained by wandering up and down the universe as a result of the reactions of karma. What is that? One should endeavor to become Kåñëa conscious. If one tries to spread Kåñëa consciousness all over the world, he should be understood to be performing the best welfare activity. The Lord is automatically very pleased with him. If the Lord is pleased with him, what is left for him to achieve? If one has been recognized by the Lord, even if he does not ask the Lord for anything, the Lord, who is within everyone, supplies him whatever he wants. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä teñäà nityäbhiyuktänäà yoga-kñemaà vahämy aham . Again, as stated here, tapyante loka-täpena sädhavaù präyaço janäù. The best welfare activity is raising people to the platform of Kåñëa consciousness, since the conditioned souls are suffering only for want of Kåñëa consciousness. The Lord Himself also comes to mitigate the suffering of humanity."

To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium.\"  All the çästras conclude, therefore, that spreading the Kåñëa consciousness movement is the best welfare activity in the world. Because of the ultimate benefit this bestows upon people in general, the Lord very quickly recognizes such service performed by a devotee."
