    "translation": "Exalted, self-satisfied persons who preach to the entire world think of your lotus feet constantly within their hearts. However, when persons who do not know your austerity see you moving with Umä, they misunderstand you to be lusty, or when they see you wandering in the crematorium they mistakenly think that you are ferocious and envious. Certainly they are shameless. They cannot understand your activities.",

Even the most intelligent person cannot understand what a Vaiñëava like Lord Çiva is doing or how he is acting. Those who are conquered by lusty desires and anger cannot estimate the glories of Lord Çiva, whose position is always transcendental. In all the activities associated with lusty desires, Lord Çiva is an implement of ätma-räma. Ordinary persons, therefore, should not try to understand Lord Çiva and his activities. One who tries to criticize the activities of Lord Çiva is shameless."
