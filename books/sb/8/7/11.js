There were three different parties in the churning of Mandara Mountain—the demigods, who were in the mode of goodness, the demons, who were in the mode of passion, and the snake Väsuki, who was in the mode of ignorance. Since they were all becoming tired (Väsuki so much so that he was almost going to die), Lord Viñëu, to encourage them to continue the work of churning the ocean, entered into them according to their respective modes of nature—goodness, passion and ignorance."
