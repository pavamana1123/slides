    "translation": "O lord, the five important Vedic mantras are represented by your five faces, from which the thirty-eight most celebrated Vedic mantras have been generated. Your Lordship, being celebrated as Lord Çiva, is self-illuminated. You are directly situated as the supreme truth, known as Paramätmä.",

            "content": "The five mantras mentioned in this connection are as follows: (1) Puruña, (2) Aghora, (3) Sadyojäta, (4) Vämadeva, and (5) Éçäna. These five mantras are within the category of thirty-eight special Vedic mantras chanted by Lord Çiva, who is therefore celebrated as Çiva or Mahädeva. Another reason why Lord Çiva is called Çiva, which means \"all-auspicious,\" is that he is self-illuminated, exactly like Lord Viñëu, who is the Paramätmä. Because Lord Çiva is directly an incarnation of Lord Viñëu, he is situated as Lord Viñëu's direct representative. This fact is corroborated by a Vedic mantra: patià viçvasyätmeçvaraà çäçvatam. çivam acyutam. The Supersoul is called by many names, of which Maheçvara, Çiva and Acyuta are especially mentioned."
