The Lord's abode is on an island called Çvetadvépa, which is situated in the ocean of milk.",

Mahäräja Parékñit is specifically addressed as arindama because in his political life he was able to subdue all kinds of enemies, and even though he was a young king, as soon as he heard that he was going to die within seven days, he immediately left his kingdom. He did not follow the dictates of enemies within his body, such as lust, greed and anger. He was not at all angry with the muni's son who had cursed him. Rather, he accepted the curse and prepared for his death in the association of Çukadeva Gosvämé. Death is inevitable; no one can surpass the force of death. Therefore Mahäräja Parékñit, while fully alive, wanted to hear Çrémad-Bhägavatam. He is consequently addressed here as arindama."

The devotees are all demigods. There are two kinds of men within this world. One is called the deva, and the other is called the asura. The Padma Puräëa states:"

Rävaëa, for example, was a great devotee of Lord Çiva, but he is described as an asura. Similarly, Hiraëyakaçipu is described as a great devotee of Lord Brahmä, yet he was also an asura. Therefore, only the devotee of Lord Viñëu is called sura, not asura. Lord Kåñëa is very much pleased with His devotees, even if they are not on the topmost stage of devotional service. Even on the lower stages of devotional service one is transcendental, and if one continues with devotional life, he continues to be a deva or sura. If one continues in this way, Kåñëa will always be pleased with him and will give him all instructions so that he may very easily return home, back to Godhead."

The island known as Çvetadvépa, which is in the ocean of milk, is transcendental. It has nothing to do with this material world. A city government may have a rest house where the governor and important government officers stay. Such a rest house is not an ordinary house. Similarly, although Çvetadvépa, which is in the ocean of milk, is in this material world, it is paraà padam, transcendental."
