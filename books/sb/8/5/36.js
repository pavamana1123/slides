I adore the primeval Lord Govinda, in pursuance of whose order the sun performs his journey, mounting the wheel of time.\" The sun is actually the eye of the Lord. In the Vedic mantras it is said that unless the Supreme Personality of Godhead sees, no one can see. Unless there is sunlight, no living entity on any planet can see. Therefore the sun is considered to be the eye of the Supreme Lord. That is confirmed here by the words yac-cakñur äsét and in the Brahma-saàhitä by the words yac-cakñur eña savitä. The word savitä means the sun-god."
