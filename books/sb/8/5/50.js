You are the controller of all three of the modes of nature, but at the present You are in favor of the quality of goodness. Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto You.",

            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead controls the material activities manifested by the three modes of material nature. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, nirguëaà guëa-bhoktå ca: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always transcendental to the material qualities (sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa), but nonetheless He is their controller. The Lord manifests Himself in three features—as Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara—to control these three qualities. He personally takes charge of sattva-guëa as Lord Viñëu, and He entrusts the charge of rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa to Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva. Ultimately, however, He is the controller of all three guëas. Lord Brahmä, expressing his appreciation, said that because Lord Viñëu had now taken charge of the activities of goodness, there was every hope that the demigods would be successful in fulfilling their desires. The demigods were harassed by the demons, who were infested with tamo-guëa. However, as Lord Brahmä has previously described, since the time of sattva-guëa had now arrived, the demigods could naturally expect to fulfill their desires. The demigods are supposedly well advanced in knowledge, yet they could not understand the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord is addressed here as anantäya. Although Lord Brahmä knows past, present and future, he is unable to understand the unlimited knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
