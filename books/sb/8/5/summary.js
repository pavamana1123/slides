During the reign of this Manu, Indra, the King of heaven, was known as Vibhu. Among the demigods were the Bhütarayas, and among the seven åñis were Hiraëyaromä, Vedaçirä and Ürdhvabähu. The åñi known as Çubhra, by his wife, Vikuëöhä, gave birth to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vaikuëöha. This Supreme Personality of Godhead manifested a Vaikuëöha planet at the request of Ramädevé. His power and activities are mentioned in the Third Canto."

During the reign of this Manu, Mantradruma was Indra, the King of the heavenly planets. Among the demigods were the Äpyas, and among the seven åñis were Haviñmän and Véraka. The wife of Vairäja, whose name was Devasambhüti, gave birth to Ajita, an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This Ajita, taking the shape of a tortoise and holding the mountain known as Mandara on His back, churned the ocean and produced nectar for the demigods."

When the demigods were deprived of their heavenly kingdom, they went to the assembly house of Lord Brahmä and informed Lord Brahmä of what had happened. Then Brahmä, along with all the demigods, went to the shore of the ocean of milk and offered prayers to Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu."
