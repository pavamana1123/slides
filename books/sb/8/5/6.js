    "translation": "Although the great activities and transcendental qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's various incarnations are wonderfully described, sometimes we are unable to understand them. Yet everything is possible for Lord Viñëu. If one could count the atoms of the universe, then he could count the qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But no one can count the atoms of the universe, nor can anyone count the transcendental qualities of the Lord.",

            "content": "The Lord's glorious activities referred to in this connection took place after His personal bodyguards Jaya and Vijaya became Daityas, having been cursed by the great sages Sanaka, Sanätana, Sanat-kumära and Sanandana. Jaya, as Hiraëyäkña, had to fight with Varähadeva, and that same Varähadeva is mentioned in regard to the Raivata millennium. The fighting, however, took place during the reign of the first Manu, Sväyambhuva. Therefore according to some authorities there are two Varähas. According to others, however, Varäha appeared during the regime of Sväyambhuva Manu and stayed in the water until that of Raivata Manu. Some may doubt that this could be possible, but the answer is that everything is possible. If one could count the atoms within the universe, one could count the qualities of Lord Viñëu. But the atoms of the universe are impossible for anyone to count, and similarly no one can count the transcendental qualities of the Lord."
