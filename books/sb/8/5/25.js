    "translation": "There [at Çvetadvépa], Lord Brahmä offered prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though he had never seen the Supreme Lord. Simply because Lord Brahmä had heard about the Supreme Personality of Godhead from Vedic literature, with a fixed mind he offered the Lord prayers as written or approved by Vedic literature.",

This we have seen in many instances. The word çruta-pürväya is significant. We get experience by directly seeing or by hearing. If it is not possible to see someone directly, we can hear about him from authentic sources. Sometimes people ask whether we can show them God. This is ludicrous. It is not necessary for one to see God before he can accept God. Our sensory perception is always incomplete. Therefore, even if we see God, we may not be able to understand Him. When Kåñëa was on earth, many, many people saw Him but could not understand that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà tanum äçritam . Even though the rascals and fools saw Kåñëa personally, they could not understand that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even upon seeing God personally, one who is unfortunate cannot understand Him. Therefore we have to hear about God, Kåñëa, from the authentic Vedic literature and from persons who understand the Vedic version properly. Even though Brahmä had not seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead before, he was confident that the Lord was there in Çvetadvépa. Thus he took the opportunity to go there and offer prayers to the Lord."

            "content": "These prayers were not ordinary concocted prayers. Prayers must be approved by Vedic literature, as indicated in this verse by the words daivébhir gérbhiù. In our Kåñëa consciousness movement we do not allow any song that has not been approved or sung by bona fide devotees. We cannot allow cinema songs to be sung in the temple. We generally sing two songs. One is çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu nityänanda çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda. This is bona fide. It is always mentioned in the Caitanya-caritämåta, and it is accepted by the äcäryas. The other, of course, is the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. We may also sing the songs of Narottama däsa Öhäkura, Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura and Locana däsa Öhäkura, but these two songs—\"çré-kåñëa-caitanya\" and the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra—are sufficient to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although we cannot see Him. Seeing the Lord is not as important as appreciating Him from the authentic literature or the authentic statements of authorized persons."
