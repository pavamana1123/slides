    "translation": "Upon seeing that the demigods were bereft of all influence and strength and that the three worlds were consequently devoid of auspiciousness, and upon seeing that the demigods were in an awkward position whereas all the demons were flourishing, Lord Brahmä, who is above all the demigods and who is most powerful, concentrated his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus being encouraged, he became bright-faced and spoke to the demigods as follows.",

            "content": "After hearing from the demigods the real situation, Lord Brahmä was very much concerned because the demons were unnecessarily so powerful. When demons become powerful, the entire world is placed in an awkward position because demons are simply interested in their own sense gratification and not in the welfare of the world. Demigods or devotees, however, are concerned with the welfare of all living beings. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, for example, left his ministership and went to Våndävana for the benefit of the entire world (lokänäà hita-käriëau). This is the nature of a saintly person or demigod. Even impersonalists think of the welfare of all people. Thus Brahmä was very much concerned at seeing the demons in power."
