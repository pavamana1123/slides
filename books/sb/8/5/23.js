Since the beginning of Kali-yuga, however, people have practically been unable to surrender to the lotus feet of Kåñëa, and therefore, after some five thousand years, Kåñëa came again as Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu just to teach the entire world how to surrender unto Him, unto Çré Kåñëa, and thus be purified."

Thus there is still a balance of 427,000 years to come. Of these 427,000 years, the 10,000 years of the saìkértana movement inaugurated by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu 500 years ago provide the opportunity for the fallen souls of Kali-yuga to take to the Kåñëa consciousness movement, chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra and thus be delivered from the clutches of material existence and return home, back to Godhead."

If one actually wants happiness, one must go to the spiritual world. The material world is characterized by a struggle for existence, and survival of the fittest is a well-known principle, but the poor souls of this material world do not know what is survival and who is fit. Survival does not mean that one should die; survival means that one should not die, but should enjoy an everlastingly blissful life of knowledge. This is survival. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is meant to make every person fit for survival. Indeed, it is meant to stop the struggle for existence. The Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä give definite directions on how to stop the struggle for existence and how to survive in eternal life. The saìkértana movement, therefore, is a great opportunity. Simply by hearing Bhagavad-gétä and chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, one becomes completely purified. Thus the struggle for existence ceases, and one goes back home, back to Godhead."
