    "translation": "Mahendra, the King of Heaven, was generated from the prowess of the Lord, the demigods were generated from the mercy of the Lord, Lord Çiva was generated from the anger of the Lord, and Lord Brahmä from His sober intelligence. The Vedic mantras were generated from the bodily holes of the Lord, and the great saints and prajäpatis were generated from His genitals. May that supremely powerful Lord be pleased with us.",
