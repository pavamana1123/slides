The brähmaëas guide human society in becoming happy by satisfying Lord Viñëu, and according to their advice, the kñatriyas, who are called nara-deva, keep law and order so that other people, namely the vaiçyas and çüdras, may properly follow regulative principles. In this way, people are gradually elevated to Kåñëa consciousness."
