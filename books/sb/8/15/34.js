Here the brähmaëa descendants of Bhågu decided that although Mahäräja Bali was situated on the throne of Indra, he would not be able to stay there unless he performed such sacrifices. Therefore they advised Mahäräja Bali to perform at least as many açvamedha-yajïas as Indra. The word ayäjayan indicates that all the brähmaëas induced Bali Mahäräja to perform such sacrifices."
