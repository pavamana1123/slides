All the demigods, being afraid of him, left the heavenly planets and went away, following the instructions of their guru."

            "content": "Mahäräja Parékñit wanted to understand how Lord Vämanadeva, on the plea of taking three paces of land from Bali Mahäräja, took everything away from him and arrested him. Çukadeva Gosvämé responded to this inquiry with the following explanation. In the fight between the demons and the demigods, as described in the Eleventh Chapter of this canto, Bali was defeated, and he died in the fight, but by the grace of Çukräcärya he regained his life. Thus he engaged himself in the service of Çukräcärya, his spiritual master. The descendants of Bhågu, being pleased with him, engaged him in the Viçvajit-yajïa. When this yajïa was performed, from the fire of yajïa came a chariot, horses, a flag, a bow, armor and two quivers of arrows. Mahäräja Prahläda, Bali Mahäräja's grandfather, gave Bali an eternal garland of flowers, and Çukräcärya gave him a conchshell. Bali Mahäräja, after offering obeisances to Prahläda, the brähmaëas and his spiritual master, Çukräcärya, equipped himself to fight with Indra and went to Indrapuré with his soldiers. Blowing his conchshell, he attacked the outskirts of Indra's kingdom. When Indra saw Bali Mahäräja's prowess, he went to his own spiritual master, Båhaspati, told him about Bali's strength, and inquired about his duty. Båhaspati informed the demigods that because Bali had been endowed with extraordinary power by the brähmaëas, the demigods could not fight with him. Their only hope was to gain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, there was no alternative. Under the circumstances, Båhaspati advised the demigods to leave the heavenly planets and keep themselves somewhere invisible. The demigods followed his orders, and Bali Mahäräja, along with his associates, gained the entire kingdom of Indra. The descendants of Bhågu Muni, being very affectionate to their disciple Bali Mahäräja, engaged him in performing one hundred açvamedha-yajïas. In this way, Bali enjoyed the opulences of the heavenly planets."
