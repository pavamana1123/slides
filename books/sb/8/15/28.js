We sing in our daily prayers, yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädo yasyäprasädän na gatiù kuto 'pi. By the pleasure of the spiritual master, one can get extraordinary power, especially in spiritual advancement. The blessings of the spiritual master are more powerful than one's personal endeavor for such advancement. Narottama däsa Öhäkura therefore says:"
