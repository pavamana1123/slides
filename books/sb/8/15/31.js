Therefore, when Båhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods, predicted that Bali Mahäräja would be vanquished when he insulted the brähmaëas by whose grace he had become so powerful, Bali Mahäräja's enemies were naturally anxious to know when that opportune moment would come. To pacify King Indra, Båhaspati assured him that the time would certainly come, for Båhaspati could see that in the future Bali Mahäräja would defy the orders of Çukräcärya in order to pacify Lord Viñëu, Vämanadeva. Of course, to advance in Kåñëa consciousness, one can take all risks. To please Vämanadeva, Bali Mahäräja risked defying the orders of his spiritual master, Çukräcärya. Because of this, he would lose all his property, yet because of devotional service to the Lord, he would get more than he expected, and in the future, in the eighth manvantara, he would occupy the throne of Indra again."
