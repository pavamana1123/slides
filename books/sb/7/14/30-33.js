The Kåñëa consciousness movement is giving the population of the entire world a chance to take advantage of Kåñëa consciousness through the ISKCON centers, where one may perform Deity worship and chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra and in this way obtain results with effectiveness increased a thousand times. This constitutes the best welfare activity for human society. This was Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu's mission as it was predicted by Him in the Caitanya-bhägavata (CB Antya 4.126):"
