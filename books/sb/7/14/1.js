            "content": "In the previous chapters the great sage Närada has explained how a brahmacäré, a vänaprastha and a sannyäsé should act. He first explained the dealings of a brahmacäré, vänaprastha and sannyäsé because these three äçramas, or statuses of life, are extremely important for fulfillment of the goal of life. One should note that in the brahmacäré-äçrama, vänaprastha-äçrama and sannyäsa-äçrama there is no scope for sex life, whereas sex is allowed in gåhastha life under regulations. Närada Muni, therefore, first described brahmacarya, vänaprastha and sannyäsa because he wanted to stress that sex is not at all necessary, although one who absolutely requires it is allowed to enter gåhastha life, or household life, which is also regulated by the çästras and guru. Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja could understand all this. Therefore, as a gåhastha, he presented himself as gåha-müòha-dhéù, one who is completely ignorant of the goal of life. A person who remains a householder in family life is certainly ignorant of life's goal; he is not very much advanced in intelligence. As soon as possible, one should give up his so-called comfortable life at home and prepare to undergo austerity, or tapasya. Tapo divyaà putrakä . According to the instructions given by Åñabhadeva to His sons, we should not create a so-called comfortable situation, but must prepare to undergo austerity. This is how a human being should actually live to fulfill life's ultimate goal."
