    "translation": "Sometimes a neophyte devotee offers all the paraphernalia for worshiping the Lord, and he factually worships the Lord as the Deity, but because he is envious of the authorized devotees of Lord Viñëu, the Lord is never satisfied with his devotional service.",

In Bhagavad-gétä  it is said, na ca tasmän manuñyeñu kaçcin me priya-kåttamaù: if one wants to be recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he must preach the glories of the Lord. One who worships the Deity must therefore be extremely respectful to preachers; otherwise simply worshiping the Deity will keep one in the lower stage of devotion."
