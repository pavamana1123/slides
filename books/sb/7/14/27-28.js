    "translation": "Närada Muni continued: Now I shall describe the places where religious performances may be well executed. Any place where a Vaiñëava is available is an excellent place for all auspicious activities. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the support of this entire cosmic manifestation, with all its moving and nonmoving living entities, and the temple where the Deity of the Lord is installed is a most sacred place. Furthermore, places where learned brähmaëas observe Vedic principles by means of austerity, education and mercy are also most auspicious and sacred.",

At the present day, especially in big, big cities, people live in small apartments and are not able to establish a Deity or temple. Under the circumstances, therefore, the centers and temples being established by the expanding Kåñëa consciousness movement are the best sacred places for performing religious ceremonies. Although people in general are no longer interested in religious ceremonies or Deity worship, the Kåñëa consciousness movement gives everyone the chance to advance in spiritual life by becoming Kåñëa conscious."
