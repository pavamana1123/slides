Närada Muni has already described the deça (place) and käla (time). The käla has been described in verses twenty through twenty-four, beginning with the words ayane viñuve kuryäd vyatépäte dina-kñaye. And the places for giving charity or performing ritualistic ceremonies have been described in verses thirty through thirty-three, beginning with saräàsi puñkarädéni kñeträëy arhäçritäny uta. Now, to whom everything must be given is decided in this verse. Harir evaika urvéça yan-mayaà vai caräcaram. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the root of everything, and therefore He is the best pätra, or person, to whom everything must be given. In Bhagavad-gétä  it is said:"
