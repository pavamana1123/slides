    "translation": "Auspicious indeed are the places where there is a temple of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, in which He is duly worshiped, and also the places where there flow the celebrated sacred rivers mentioned in the Puräëas, the supplementary Vedic literatures. Anything spiritual done there is certainly very effective.",

In this verse, however, it is authoritatively stated that any place where the Deity is worshiped is transcendental; it does not belong to the material world. It is also said that the forest is in the mode of goodness, and therefore those who want to cultivate spiritual life are advised to go to the forest (vanaà gato yad dharim äçrayeta ). But one should not go to the forest simply to live like a monkey. Monkeys and other ferocious animals also live in the forest, but a person who goes to the forest for spiritual culture must accept the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as shelter (vanaà gato yad dharim äçrayeta). One should not be satisfied simply to go to the forest; one must take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, therefore, since it is impossible to go to the forest for spiritual culture, one is recommended to live in the temple community as a devotee, regularly worship the Deity, follow the regulative principles and thus make the place like Vaikuëöha. The forest may be in goodness, the cities and villages in passion, and the brothels, hotels and restaurants in ignorance, but when one lives in the temple community he lives in Vaikuëöha. Therefore it is said here, çreyasäà padam: it is the best, most auspicious place."

It was therefore customary for members of the three higher classes—namely the brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas—to worship the çälagräma-çilä, or a small Deity of Rädhä-Kåñëa or Sétä-Räma in each and every home. This made everything auspicious. But now they have given up the Deity worship. Men have become modernized and are consequently indulging in all sorts of sinful activities, and therefore they are extremely unhappy."

The Kåñëa consciousness movement invites everyone from all over the world, without discrimination as to caste or creed, to come to its centers and cultivate spiritual life perfectly."
