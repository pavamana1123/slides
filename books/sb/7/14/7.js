    "translation": "The natural products created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be utilized to maintain the bodies and souls of all living entities. The necessities of life are of three types: those produced from the sky [from rainfall], from the earth [from the mines, the seas or the fields], and from the atmosphere [that which is obtained suddenly and unexpectedly].",

One who is intelligent can see that all living entities in the 8,400,000 bodily forms are part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are His sons. Everything within the material and spiritual worlds is the property of the Supreme Lord (éçäväsyam idaà sarvam ), and therefore everything has a relationship with Him.

Everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for everything is created by Him. All living entities, being the Lord's sons, His eternal parts and parcels, have the right to use their father's property by nature's arrangement. As stated in the Upaniñads, tena tyaktena bhuïjéthä mä gådhaù kasya svid dhanam . Everyone should be satisfied with the things allotted him by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; no one should encroach upon another's rights or property."

If people throughout the world take to the Kåñëa consciousness movement and chant the easy sound vibration of the transcendental name and fame of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be no scarcity of rainfall; consequently food grains, fruits and flowers will be properly produced, and all the necessities of life will be easily obtained. Gåhasthas, or householders, should take the responsibility for organizing such natural production. It is therefore said, tasyaiva hetoù prayateta kovidaù. An intelligent person should try to spread Kåñëa consciousness through the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, and all the necessities of life will automatically follow."
