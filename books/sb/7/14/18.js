    "translation": "Therefore, my dear King, first offer prasäda unto the brähmaëas and the demigods, and after sumptuously feeding them you may distribute prasäda to other living entities according to your ability. In this way you will be able to worship all living entities—or, in other words, the supreme living entity within every living entity.",

            "content": "To distribute prasäda to all living entities, the process is that we must first offer prasäda to the brähmaëas and the Vaiñëavas, for the demigods are represented by the brähmaëas. In this way the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone's heart, will be worshiped. This is the Vedic system of offering prasäda. Whenever there is a ceremony for distribution of prasäda, the prasäda is offered first to the brähmaëas, then to the children and old men, then to the women, and then to animals like dogs and other domestic animals. When it is said that Näräyaëa, the Supreme Being, is situated in everyone's heart, this does not mean that everyone has become Näräyaëa or that a particular poor man has become Näräyaëa. Such a conclusion is rejected herein."
