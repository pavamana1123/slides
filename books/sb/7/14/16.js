            "content": "The entire Vedic civilization aims at satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This was possible in Satya-yuga by meditation upon the Supreme Lord within the core of one's heart and in Tretä-yuga by the performance of costly yajïas. The same goal could be achieved in Dväpara-yuga by worship of the Lord in the temple, and in this age of Kali one can achieve the same goal by performing saìkértana-yajïa. Therefore one who has education and wealth must use them to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by helping the saìkértana movement that has already begun—the Hare Kåñëa movement, or Kåñëa consciousness movement. All educated and wealthy persons must join this movement, since money and education are meant for service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If money and education are not engaged in the service of the Lord, these valuable assets must be engaged in the service of mäyä. The education of so-called scientists, philosophers and poets is now engaged in the service of mäyä, and the wealth of the rich is also engaged in mäyä's service. The service of mäyä, however, creates a chaotic condition in the world. Therefore the wealthy man and the educated man should sacrifice their knowledge and opulence by dedicating them for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord and joining this saìkértana movement (yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù )."
