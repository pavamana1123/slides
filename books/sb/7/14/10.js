    "translation": "Even if one is a householder rather than a brahmacäré, a sannyäsé or a vänaprastha, one should not endeavor very hard for religiosity, economic development or satisfaction of the senses. Even in householder life, one should be satisfied to maintain body and soul together with whatever is available with minimum endeavor, according to place and time, by the grace of the Lord. One should not engage oneself in ugra-karma.",

First one should be religious, observing various rules and regulations, and then one must earn some money for maintenance of his family and the satisfaction of his senses. The most important ceremony for sense gratification is marriage because sexual intercourse is one of the principal necessities of the material body. Yan maithunädi-gåhamedhi-sukhaà hi tuccham . Although sexual intercourse is not a very exalted requisite in life, both animals and men require some sense gratification because of material propensities. One should be satisfied with married life and not expend energy for extra sense gratification or sex life."

            "content": "As for economic development, the responsibility for this should be entrusted mainly to the vaiçyas and gåhasthas. Human society should be divided into varëas and äçramas-brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya, çüdra, brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. Economic development is necessary for gåhasthas. Brähmaëa gåhasthas should be satisfied with a life of adhyayana, adhyäpana, yajana and yäjana—being learned scholars, teaching others to be scholars, learning how to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, and also teaching others how to worship Lord Viñëu, or even the demigods. A brähmaëa should do this without remuneration, but he is allowed to accept charity from a person whom he teaches how to be a human being. As for the kñatriyas, they are supposed to be the kings of the land, and the land should be distributed to the vaiçyas for agricultural activities, cow protection and trade. Çüdras must work; sometimes they should engage in occupational duties as cloth manufacturers, weavers, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, brass-smiths, and so on, or else they should engage in hard labor to produce food grains."

            "content": "These are the different occupational duties by which men should earn their livelihood, and in this way human society should be simple. At the present moment, however, everyone is engaged in technological advancement, which is described in Bhagavad-gétä as ugra-karma—extremely severe endeavor. This ugra-karma is the cause of agitation within the human mind. Men are engaging in many sinful activities and becoming degraded by opening slaughterhouses, breweries and cigarette factories, as well as nightclubs and other establishments for sense enjoyment. In this way they are spoiling their lives. In all of these activities, of course, householders are involved, and therefore it is advised here, with the use of the word api, that even though one is a householder, one should not engage himself in severe hardships. One's means of livelihood should be extremely simple. As for those who are not gåhasthas—the brahmacärés, vänaprasthas and sannyäsés—they don't have to do anything but strive for advancement in spiritual life. This means that three fourths of the entire population should stop sense gratification and simply be engaged in the advancement of Kåñëa consciousness. Only one fourth of the population should be gåhastha, and that should be according to laws of restricted sense gratification. The gåhasthas, vänaprasthas, brahmacärés and sannyäsés should endeavor together with their total energy to become Kåñëa conscious. This type of civilization is called daiva-varëäçrama. One of the objectives of the Kåñëa consciousness movement is to establish this daiva-varëäçrama, but not to encourage so-called varëäçrama without scientifically organized endeavor by human society."
