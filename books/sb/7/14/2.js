    "translation": "Närada Muni replied: My dear King, those who stay at home as householders must act to earn their livelihood, and instead of trying to enjoy the results of their work themselves, they should offer these results to Kåñëa, Väsudeva. How to satisfy Väsudeva in this life can be perfectly understood through the association of great devotees of the Lord.",

This should be the principle for everyone's life. Närada Muni has already described the principles of life for a brahmacäré, vänaprastha and sannyäsé, and now he is describing how a gåhastha should live. The basic principle is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Saintly persons are generally known as munis, or thoughtful philosophers concerned with transcendental subject matters, and mahä-munén refers to those who have not only thoroughly studied the goal of life but who are actually engaged in satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva. These persons are known as devotees. Unless one associates with devotees, one cannot learn the science of väsudevärpaëa, or dedicating one's life to Väsudeva, Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Even fifty years ago, I saw that in the villages of Bengal and the suburbs of Calcutta, people engaged in hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam daily when all their activities ended, or at least in the evening before going to bed. Everyone would hear the Bhägavatam. Bhägavata classes were held in every village, and thus people had the advantage of hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam, which describes everything about the aim of life—liberation or salvation. This will be clearly explained in the next verses."
