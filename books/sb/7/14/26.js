These must be observed according to time and circumstances and the directions of the çästra. Bhagavad-gétä strongly recommends, jïätvä çästra-vidhänoktam: everything must be performed as indicated in the çästras. For Kali-yuga, the çästras enjoin that saìkértana-yajïa be performed always: kértanéyaù sadä hariù . All the ritualistic ceremonies recommended in the çästras must be preceded and followed by saìkértana. This is the recommendation of Çréla Jéva Gosvämé."
