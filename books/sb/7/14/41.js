            "content": "From the Vedas we learn that the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Person. Every living entity is an individual person, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the Supreme Person. A brähmaëa who is well versed in Vedic knowledge and fully conversant with transcendental matters becomes a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore one should worship such a brähmaëa or Vaiñëava. A Vaiñëava is superior to a brähmaëa because whereas a brähmaëa knows that he is Brahman, not matter, a Vaiñëava knows that he is not only Brahman but also an eternal servant of the Supreme Brahman. Therefore, worship of a Vaiñëava is superior to worship of the Deity in the temple. Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says, säkñäd dharitvena samasta-çästraiù: in all the scriptures the spiritual master, who is the best of the brähmaëas, the best of the Vaiñëavas, is considered to be as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This does not mean, however, that the Vaiñëava thinks himself God, for this is blasphemous. Although a brähmaëa or Vaiñëava is worshiped as being as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such a devotee always remains a faithful servant of the Lord and never tries to enjoy the prestige that might accrue to him from being the Supreme Lord's representative."
