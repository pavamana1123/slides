Everyone should join the saìkértana movement, offering to the fire of this movement the oblations of his knowledge and riches. In our saìkértana movement, or Hare Kåñëa movement, we offer sumptuous prasäda to the Deity and later distribute the same prasäda to the brähmaëas, the Vaiñëavas and then to the people in general. Kåñëa's prasäda is offered to the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas, and the prasäda of the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas is offered to the general populace. This kind of sacrifice—chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra and distribution of prasäda—is the most perfect and bona fide way of offering sacrifice for the pleasure of Yajïa, or Viñëu."
