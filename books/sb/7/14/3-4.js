    "translation": "A gåhastha must associate again and again with saintly persons, and with great respect he must hear the nectar of the activities of the Supreme Lord and His incarnations as these activities are described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam and other Puräëas. Thus one should gradually become detached from affection for his wife and children, exactly like a man awakening from a dream.",

            "content": "The Kåñëa consciousness movement has been established to give gåhasthas all over the world an opportunity to hear Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä specifically. The process, as described in many ways, is one of hearing and chanting (çåëvatäà sva-kathäù kåñëaù puëya-çravaëa-kértanaù ). Everyone, especially the gåhasthas, who are müòha-dhé, ignorant about the goal of life, should be given opportunities to hear about Kåñëa. Simply by hearing, by attending lectures in the different centers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, where topics of Kåñëa from Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam are discussed, they will be purified of their sinful inclination for constant indulgence in illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling, which have all become prominent in modern days. Thus they can be raised to the status of light. Puëya-çravaëa-kértanaù. Simply by joining the kértana—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—and by hearing about Kåñëa from Bhagavad-gétä, one must be purified, especially if he also takes prasäda. This is all going on in the Kåñëa consciousness movement."

The word abhékñëam is very important. We should hear again and again. There is no question of stopping: even if one has read these topics many times, he should go on reading again and again because bhagavat-kathä, the words spoken by Kåñëa and spoken by Kåñëa's devotees about Kåñëa, are amåtam, nectar. The more one drinks this amåtam, the more he advances in his eternal life."

            "content": "The human form of life is meant for liberation, but unfortunately, due to the influence of Kali-yuga, every day the gåhasthas are working hard like asses. Early in the morning they rise and travel even a hundred miles away to earn bread. Especially in the Western countries, I have seen that people awaken at five o'clock to go to offices and factories to earn their livelihood. People in Calcutta and Bombay also do this every day. They work very hard in the office or factory, and again they spend three or four hours in transportation returning home. Then they retire at ten o'clock and again rise early in the morning to go to their offices and factories. This kind of hard labor is described in the çästras as the life of pigs and stool-eaters. Näyaà deho deha-bhäjäà nåloke kañöän kämän arhate vid-bhujäà ye:  One must find some time for hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä. This is Vedic culture. One should work eight hours at the most to earn his livelihood, and either in the afternoon or in the evening a householder should associate with devotees to hear about the incarnations of Kåñëa and His activities and thus be gradually liberated from the clutches of mäyä. However, instead of finding time to hear about Kåñëa, the householders, after working hard in offices and factories, find time to go to a restaurant or a club where instead of hearing about Kåñëa and His activities they are very much pleased to hear about the political activities of demons and nondevotees and to enjoy sex, wine, women and meat and in this way waste their time. This is not gåhastha life, but demoniac life. The Kåñëa consciousness movement, however, with its centers all over the world, gives such fallen and condemned persons an opportunity to hear about Kåñëa."

Similarly, one's gross society, family and love are also a dream, and this dream will be over as soon as one dies. Therefore, whether one is dreaming in a subtle way or a gross way, these dreams are all false and temporary. One's real business is to understand that one is soul (ahaà brahmäsmi) and that his activities should therefore be different. Then one can be happy."
