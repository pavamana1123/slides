    "translation": "One should perform the çräddha ceremony on the Makara-saìkränti [the day when the sun begins to move north] or on the Karkaöa-saìkränti [the day when the sun begins to move south]. One should also perform this ceremony on the Meña-saìkränti day and the Tulä-saìkränti day, in the yoga named Vyatépäta, on that day in which three lunar tithis are conjoined, during an eclipse of either the moon or the sun, on the twelfth lunar day, and in the Çravaëa-nakñatra. One should perform this ceremony on the Akñaya-tåtéyä day, on the ninth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the month of Kärtika, on the four añöakäs in the winter season and cool season, on the seventh lunar day of the bright fortnight of the month of Mägha, during the conjunction of Maghä-nakñatra and the full-moon day, and on the days when the moon is completely full, or not quite completely full, when these days are conjoined with the nakñatras from which the names of certain months are derived. One should also perform the çräddha ceremony on the twelfth lunar day when it is in conjunction with any of the nakñatras named Anurädhä, Çravaëa, Uttara-phalguné, Uttaräñäòhä or Uttara-bhädrapadä. Again, one should perform this ceremony when the eleventh lunar day is in conjunction with either Uttara-phalguné, Uttaräñäòhä or Uttara-bhädrapadä. Finally, one should perform this ceremony on days conjoined with one's own birth star [janma-nakñatra] or with Çravaëa-nakñatra.",

These are mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä . The first day when the sun begins to move north and enter the zodiacal sign of Capricorn is called Makara-saìkränti, and the first day when the sun begins to move south and enter the sign of Cancer is called Karkaöa-saìkränti. On these two days of the year, one should perform the çräddha ceremony."

Both of these days occur only once within a year. The word yoga refers to a certain relationship between the sun and moon as they move in the sky. There are twenty-seven different degrees of yoga, of which the seventeenth is called Vyatépäta. On the day when this occurs, one should perform the çräddha ceremony. A tithi, or lunar day, consists of the distance between the longitude of the sun and that of the moon. Sometimes a tithi is less than twenty-four hours. When it starts after sunrise on a certain day and ends before the sunrise of the following day, the previous tithi and the following tithi both \"touch\" the twenty-four-hour day between the sunrises. This is called tryaha-sparça, or a day touched by some portion of three tithis."
