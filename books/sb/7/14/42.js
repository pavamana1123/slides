    "translation": "My dear King Yudhiñöhira, the brähmaëas, especially those engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord throughout the entire world, are recognized and worshiped by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the heart and soul of all creation. The brähmaëas, by their preaching, sanctify the three worlds with the dust of their lotus feet, and thus they are worshipable even for Kåñëa.",

The brähmaëas preach the cult of Kåñëa consciousness all around the world, and therefore, although they worship Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord also recognizes them as worshipable. The relationship is reciprocal. The brähmaëas want to worship Kåñëa, and similarly Kåñëa wants to worship the brähmaëas. In conclusion, therefore, brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas who are engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord must be worshiped by religionists, philosophers and people in general. At the Räjasüya-yajïa of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, many hundreds and thousands of brähmaëas were present, yet Kåñëa was selected to be worshiped first. Therefore, Kåñëa is always the Supreme Person, but by His causeless mercy He recognizes the brähmaëas as dearmost to Him."
