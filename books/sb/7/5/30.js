    "translation": "Prahläda Mahäräja replied: Because of their uncontrolled senses, persons too addicted to materialistic life make progress toward hellish conditions and repeatedly chew that which has already been chewed. Their inclinations toward Kåñëa are never aroused, either by the instructions of others, by their own efforts, or by a combination of both.",

So-called politicians, erudite scholars and philosophers who read Bhagavad-gétä try to twist some meaning from it to suit their material purposes, but their misunderstandings of Kåñëa will not yield them any profit. Because such politicians, philosophers and scholars are interested in using Bhagavad-gétä as a vehicle for adjusting things materially, for them constant thought of Kåñëa, or Kåñëa consciousness, is impossible (matir na kåñëe).

As explained in the following verses, unless one adheres to such a great personality, one cannot understand Kåñëa. Hiraëyakaçipu wanted to know where Prahläda had gotten this Kåñëa consciousness. Who had taught him? Prahläda sarcastically replied, \"My dear father, persons like you never understand Kåñëa. One can understand Kåñëa only by serving a mahat, a great soul. Those who try to adjust material conditions are said to be chewing the chewed. No one has been able to adjust material conditions, but life after life, generation after generation, people try and repeatedly fail. Unless one is properly trained by a mahat—a mahätmä, or unalloyed devotee of the Lord—there is no possibility of one's understanding Kåñëa and His devotional service.\""
