The word dharma here does not refer to some religious faith. As clearly stated, dharmo hy asyopadeñöavyo räjïäà yo gåha-medhinäm. There are two kinds of royal families—one whose members are simply attached to household life and the other consisting of räjarñis, kings who govern with ruling power but are as good as great saints. Prahläda Mahäräja wanted to become a räjarñi, whereas Hiraëyakaçipu wanted him to become a king attached to sense enjoyment (gåha-medhinäm). Therefore in the Äryan system there is varëäçrama-dharma, by which everyone should be educated according to his position in society's division of varëa (brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra) and äçrama (brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa)."

            "content": "A devotee purified by devotional service is always in the transcendental position above the mundane qualities. Thus the difference between Prahläda Mahäräja and Hiraëyakaçipu was that Hiraëyakaçipu wanted to keep Prahläda in mundane attachment whereas Prahläda was above the modes of material nature. As long as one is under the control of material nature, his occupational duty is different from that of a person not under such control. One's real dharma, or occupational duty, is described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (dharmaà tu säkñäd bhagavat-praëétam  every living being is an eternal servant of Kåñëa. That is one's real occupational duty."
