Instead, with broader vision, they see that everyone is part of Kåñëa, as confirmed by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu (jévera 'svarüpa' haya-kåñëera 'nitya-däsa' ). Every living entity, being part of the Supreme Lord, is meant to serve the Lord, just as every part of the body is meant to serve the whole body."

A Vaiñëava sees other servants to be so advanced that he has much to learn from them. Thus he accepts all other devotees of the Lord as prabhus, masters. Although everyone is a servant of the Lord, one Vaiñëava servant, because of humility, sees another servant as his master. Understanding of the master begins from understanding of the spiritual master."

Oneness is possible through this understanding, not through artificially thinking that every one of us is God or equal to God. The true understanding is that God is the supreme master and that all of us are servants of the Supreme Lord and are therefore on the same platform. This had already been taught to Prahläda Mahäräja by his spiritual master, Närada, but Prahläda was nonetheless surprised by how a bewildered soul thinks one person his enemy and another his friend."

            "content": "As long as one adheres to the philosophy of duality, thinking one person a friend and another an enemy, he should be understood to be in the clutches of mäyä. The Mäyävädé philosopher who thinks that all living entities are God and are therefore one is also mistaken. No one is equal to God. The servant cannot be equal to the master. According to the Vaiñëava philosophy, the master is one, and the servants are also one, but the distinction between the master and servant must continue even in the liberated stage. In the conditioned stage we think that some living beings are our friends whereas others are enemies, and thus we are in duality. In the liberated stage, however, the conception is that God is the master and that all living entities, being servants of God, are one."
