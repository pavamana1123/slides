    "translation": "Prahläda Mahäräja replied: O best of the asuras, King of the demons, as far as I have learned from my spiritual master, any person who has accepted a temporary body and temporary household life is certainly embarrassed by anxiety because of having fallen in a dark well where there is no water but only suffering. One should give up this position and go to the forest [vana]. More clearly, one should go to Våndävana, where only Kåñëa consciousness is prevalent, and should thus take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

However, he who has no devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no good qualifications because he is engaged by mental concoction in material existence, which is the external feature of the Lord.\"  those who are attached to the bodily conception of life and who thus stick to life as a gåhastha, or householder, on the platform of material sense enjoyment, cannot see the welfare of the eternal soul. Prahläda Mahäräja confirmed this by saying that if one wants success in life, he should immediately understand from the right sources what his self-interest is and how he should mold his life in spiritual consciousness. One should understand himself to be part and parcel of Kåñëa and thus completely take shelter of His lotus feet for guaranteed spiritual success. Everyone in the material world is in the bodily conception, struggling hard for existence, life after life. Prahläda Mahäräja therefore recommended that to stop this material condition of repeated birth and death, one should go to the forest (vana)."

            "content": "In the varëäçrama system, one first becomes a brahmacäré, then a gåhastha, a vänaprastha and finally a sannyäsé. Going to the forest means accepting vänaprastha life, which is between gåhastha life and sannyäsa. As confirmed in the Viñëu Puräëa (3.8.9), varëäçramäcäravatä puruñeëa paraù pumän viñëur ärädhyate:  by accepting the institution of varëa and äçrama, one can very easily elevate himself to the platform of worshiping Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Otherwise, if one remains in the bodily conception, one must rot within this material world, and his life will be a failure. Society must have divisions of brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra, and for spiritual advancement one must gradually develop as a brahmacäré, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsé. Prahläda Mahäräja recommended that his father accept vänaprastha life because as a gåhastha he was becoming increasingly demoniac due to bodily attachment. Prahläda recommended to his father that accepting vänaprastha life would be better than going deeper and deeper into gåham andha-küpam, the blind well of life as a gåhastha. In our Kåñëa consciousness movement we therefore invite all the elderly persons of the world to come to Våndävana and stay there in retired life, making advancement in spiritual consciousness, Kåñëa consciousness."
