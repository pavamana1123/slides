Çrémad-Bhägavatam is full of transcendental chanting of the holy name, and therefore the chanting and hearing of Çrémad-Bhägavatam are transcendentally full of mellows. The transcendental holy name of the Lord may be heard and chanted accordingly to the attraction of the devotee. One may chant the holy name of Lord Kåñëa, or one may chant the holy name of Lord Räma or Nåsiàhadeva (rämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan (BS 5.39)). The Lord has innumerable forms and names, and devotees may meditate upon a particular form and chant the holy name according to his attraction. The best course is to hear of the holy name, form and so on from a pure devotee of the same standard as oneself. In other words, one who is attached to Kåñëa should chant and hear from other pure devotees who are also attached to Lord Kåñëa. The same principle applies for devotees attracted by Lord Räma, Lord Nåsiàha and other forms of the Lord. Because Kåñëa is the ultimate form of the Lord (kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam ), it is best to hear about Lord Kåñëa's name, form and pastimes from a realized devotee who is particularly attracted by the form of Lord Kåñëa. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam, great devotees like Çukadeva Gosvämé have specifically described Lord Kåñëa's holy name, form and qualities. Unless one hears about the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord, one cannot clearly understand the other processes of devotional service. Therefore Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu recommends that one chant the holy name of Kåñëa. paraà vijayate çré-kåñëa-saìkértanam.

Other offenses are to worship the Deity after seeing a dead body, to pass air before the Deity, to show anger before the Deity, and to worship the Deity just after returning from a crematorium. After eating, one should not worship the Deity until one has digested his food, nor should one touch the Deity or engage in any Deity worship after eating safflower oil or hing.

In the Padma Puräëa, Uttara-khaëòa, it is said, \"All persons can generally worship within the mind.\" The Gautaméya Tantra states, \"For a sannyäsé who has no home, worship of the Deity within the mind is recommended.\" In the Närada-païcarätra it is stated by Lord Näräyaëa that worship of the Deity within the mind is called mänasa-püjä, One can become free from the four miseries by this method. Sometimes worship from the mind can be independently executed. According to the instruction of Avirhotra Muni, one of the nava-yogendras, as mentioned in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, one may worship the Deity by chanting all the mantras. Eight kinds of Deities are mentioned in the çästra, and the mental Deity is one of them. In this regard, the following description is given in the Brahma-vaivarta Puräëa."

One day he heard a discourse in an assembly of brähmaëas concerning how to worship the Deity in the temple. In that meeting, he also heard that the Deity may be worshiped within the mind. After this incident, the brähmaëa, having bathed in the Godävaré River, began mentally worshiping the Deity. He would wash the temple within his mind, and then in his imagination he would bring water from all the sacred rivers in golden and silver waterpots. He collected all kinds of valuable paraphernalia for worship, and he worshiped the Deity very gorgeously, beginning from bathing the Deity and ending with offering ärati. Thus he felt great happiness. After many years had passed in this way, one day within his mind he cooked nice sweet rice with ghee to worship the Deity. He placed the sweet rice on a golden dish and offered it to Lord Kåñëa, but he felt that the sweet rice was very hot, and therefore he touched it with his finger. He immediately felt that his finger had been burned by the hot sweet rice, and thus he began to lament. While the brähmaëa was in pain, Lord Viñëu in Vaikuëöha began smiling, and the goddess of fortune inquired from the Lord why He was smiling. Lord Viñëu then ordered His associates to bring the brähmaëa to Vaikuëöha. Thus the brähmaëa attained the liberation of sämépya, the facility of living near the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Although prayers are a part of Deity worship, they may be considered separately like the other items, such as hearing and chanting, and therefore separate statements are given herewith. The Lord has unlimited transcendental qualities and opulences, and one who feels influenced by the Lord's qualities in various activities offers prayers to the Lord. In this way he becomes successful. In this connection, the following are some of the offenses to be avoided: (a) to offer obeisances on one hand, (b) to offer obeisances with one's body covered, (c) to show one's back to the Deity, (d) to offer obeisances on the left side of the Deity, (e) to offer obeisances very near the Deity."

If one simply continues to think that he is an eternal servant of Kåñëa, even without performing any other process of devotional service, he can attain full success, for simply by this feeling one can perform all nine processes of devotional service."

In regard to worshiping the Lord as a friend, the Agastya-saàhitä states that a devotee engaged in performing devotional service by çravaëam and kértanam sometimes wants to see the Lord personally, and for this purpose he resides in the temple. Elsewhere there is this statement: \"O my Lord, Supreme Personality and eternal friend, although You are full of bliss and knowledge, You have become the friend of the residents of Våndävana. How fortunate are these devotees!\" In this statement the word \"friend\" is specifically used to indicate intense love. Friendship, therefore, is better than servitude. In the stage above däsya-rasa, the devotee accepts the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a friend. This is not at all astonishing, for when a devotee is pure in heart the opulence of his worship of the Deity diminishes as spontaneous love for the Personality of Godhead is manifested. In this regard, Çrédhara Svämé mentions Çrédäma Vipra, who expressed to himself his feelings of obligation, thinking, \"Life after life, may I be connected with Kåñëa in this friendly attitude.\""

The word Ätma-nivedanam refers to the stage at which one who has no motive other than to serve the Lord surrenders everything to the Lord and performs his activities only to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee is like a cow that is cared for by its master. When cared for by its master, a cow is not in anxiety over its maintenance. Such a cow is always devoted to its master, and it never acts independently, but only for the master's benefit. Some devotees, therefore, consider dedication of the body to the Lord to be ätma-nivedanam, and as stated in the book known as Bhakti-viveka, sometimes dedication of the soul to the Lord is called ätma-nivedanam. The best examples of ätma-nivedanam are found in Bali Mahäräja and Ambaréña Mahäräja. Ätma-nivedanam is also sometimes found in the behavior of Rukmiëédevé at Dvärakä."
