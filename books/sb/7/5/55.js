The other students were very much advanced in enjoying materialistic life through religion, economic development and sense gratification, but Prahläda Mahäräja laughed at them, knowing that this was not actual happiness, for real happiness is advancement in Kåñëa consciousness. The duty of those who follow in the footsteps of Prahläda Mahäräja is to teach the entire world how to be Kåñëa conscious and thus be really happy. Materialistic persons take to so-called religion to get some blessings so that they can improve their economic position and enjoy the material world through sense gratification. But devotees like Prahläda Mahäräja laugh at how foolish they are to be busy in a temporary life without knowledge of the soul's transmigration from one body to another. Materialistic persons are engaged in striving for temporary benefits, whereas persons advanced in spiritual knowledge, such as Prahläda Mahäräja, are not interested in the materialistic way of life. Instead, they want to be elevated to an eternal life of knowledge and bliss. Therefore, as Kåñëa is always compassionate to the fallen souls, His servants, the devotees of Lord Kåñëa, are also interested in educating the entire populace in Kåñëa consciousness. The mistake of materialistic life is understood by devotees, and therefore they smile upon it, considering it insignificant. Out of compassion, however, such devotees preach the gospel of Bhagavad-gétä all over the world."
