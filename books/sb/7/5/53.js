    "translation": "The teachers Ñaëòa and Amarka instructed Prahläda Mahäräja in the three kinds of material advancement called religion, economic development and sense gratification. Prahläda, however, being situated above such instructions, did not like them, for such instructions are based on the duality of worldly affairs, which involve one in a materialistic way of life marked by birth, death, old age and disease.",

Indeed, practically 99.9 percent of the people in the three worlds are uninterested in liberation or spiritual education. Only the devotees of the Lord, headed by such great personalities as Prahläda Mahäräja and Närada Muni, are interested in the real education of spiritual life. One cannot understand the principles of religion while staying on the material platform. Therefore one must follow these great personalities. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

Those interested in spiritual life should follow Prahläda Mahäräja in rejecting the education of religion, economic development and sense gratification. One should be interested in spiritual education. Therefore the Kåñëa consciousness movement is spreading all over the world, following in the footsteps of Prahläda Mahäräja, who did not like any of the materialistic education he received from his teachers."
