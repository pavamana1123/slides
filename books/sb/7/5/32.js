    "translation": "Unless they smear upon their bodies the dust of the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava completely freed from material contamination, persons very much inclined toward materialistic life cannot be attached to the lotus feet of the Lord, who is glorified for His uncommon activities. Only by becoming Kåñëa conscious and taking shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord in this way can one be freed from material contamination.",

The material body is the basic principle of these unwanted miserable conditions. The entire Vedic civilization is meant to relieve one from these unwanted miseries, but persons bound by the laws of nature do not know the destination of life. As described in the previous verse, éça-tantryäm uru-dämni baddhäù: they are conditioned by the three strong modes of material nature. The education that keeps the conditioned soul bound life after life is called materialistic education. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has explained that materialistic education expands the influence of mäyä. Such an education induces the conditioned soul to be increasingly attracted to materialistic life and to stray further and further away from liberation from unwanted miseries."

            "content": "One may ask why highly educated persons do not take to Kåñëa consciousness. The reason is explained in this verse. Unless one takes shelter of a bona fide, fully Kåñëa conscious spiritual master, there is no chance of understanding Kåñëa. The educators, scholars and big political leaders worshiped by millions of people cannot understand the goal of life and take to Kåñëa consciousness, for they have not accepted a bona fide spiritual master and the Vedas. Therefore in the Muëòaka Upaniñad (3.2.3) it is said, näyam ätmä pravacanena labhyo na medhayä na bahunä çrutena: one cannot become self-realized simply by having an academic education, by presenting lectures in an erudite way (pravacanena labhyaù), or by being an intelligent scientist who discovers many wonderful things. One cannot understand Kåñëa unless one is graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Only one who has surrendered to a pure devotee of Kåñëa and taken the dust of his lotus feet can understand Kåñëa. First one must understand how to get out of the clutches of mäyä. The only means is to become Kåñëa conscious. And to become Kåñëa conscious very easily, one must take shelter of a realized soul—a mahat, or mahätmä—whose only interest is to engage in the service of the Supreme Lord. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä :"
