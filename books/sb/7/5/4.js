Prahläda Mahäräja, of course, being a perfect devotee, knew everything and could say what the best part of life is. In the Vedas it is said, yasmin vijïäte samam evaà vijïätaà bhavati: if one properly understands God, he can understand any subject matter very nicely. Sometimes we have to challenge big scientists and philosophers, but by the grace of Kåñëa we emerge successful. It is impossible, practically speaking, for ordinary men to challenge scientists or philosophers concerning genuine knowledge, but a devotee can challenge them because the best of everything is known to a devotee by the grace of Kåñëa. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä :"

As a special favor, He enlightens the devotee with all knowledge by putting before him the torch of light. Prahläda Mahäräja, therefore, knew the best of knowledge, and when his father inquired from him, Prahläda gave him that knowledge. Prahläda Mahäräja was able to solve the most difficult parts of problems because of his advanced Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore he replied as follows."
