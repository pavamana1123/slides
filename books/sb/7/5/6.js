    "translation": "Närada Muni continued: When Prahläda Mahäräja spoke about the path of self-realization in devotional service, thus being faithful to the camp of his father's enemies, Hiraëyakaçipu, the King of the demons, heard Prahläda's words and he laughingly said, \"Thus is the intelligence of children spoiled by the words of the enemy.\"",

Hiraëyakaçipu never agreed with the words of Viñëu, or Kåñëa. Rather, he was angered by the intelligence of a Vaiñëava. Lord Viñëu, Lord Kåñëa, says, sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja —\"Give up all other duties and surrender unto Me\"—but demons like Hiraëyakaçipu never agree to do this. Therefore Kåñëa says:"

Such persons, being müòha and narädhama—fools and rascals, the lowest of men—would never accept Viñëu as the Supreme and surrender to Him. Hiraëyakaçipu naturally became increasingly angry that his son Prahläda was being influenced by the camp of the enemies. He therefore asked that saintly persons like Närada not be allowed within the residential quarters of his son, for otherwise Prahläda would be further spoiled by Vaiñëava instructions."
