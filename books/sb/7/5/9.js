It was surprising, of course, that in the same school the other boys of the Daityas were not polluted; only Prahläda Mahäräja was supposedly polluted by the instructions of the Vaiñëavas. The main duty of the teachers was to inquire who those Vaiñëavas were that came to teach Prahläda and spoil his intelligence."
