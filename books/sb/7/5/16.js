When there are no other arguments, he is punished. In logic, this is called argumentum ad baculum. When the two seminal brähmaëas Ñaëòa and Amarka failed to extract from Prahläda Mahäräja the cause for his having opinions different from those of his father, they called for a stick with which to chastise him to satisfy their master, Hiraëyakaçipu. Because Prahläda had become a devotee, they considered him to be contaminated by bad intelligence and to be the worst descendant in the family of demons. As it is said, where ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise. In a society or family in which everyone is a demon, for someone to become a Vaiñëava is certainly folly. Thus Prahläda Mahäräja was charged with bad intelligence because he was among demons, including his teachers, who were supposedly brähmaëas."

            "content": "The members of our Kåñëa consciousness movement are in a position similar to that of Prahläda Mahäräja. All over the world, ninety-nine percent of the people are godless demons, and therefore our preaching of Kåñëa consciousness, following in the footsteps of Prahläda Mahäräja, is always hampered by many impediments. Because of their fault of being devotees, the American boys who have sacrificed everything for preaching Kåñëa consciousness are charged with being members of the CIA. Moreover, the seminal brähmaëas in India, who say that one can become a brähmaëa only if born in a brähmaëa family, charge us with ruining the Hindu system of religion. Of course, the fact is that one becomes a brähmaëa by qualification. Because we are training Europeans and Americans to become qualified and are awarding them brahminical status, we are being charged with destroying the Hindu religion. Nonetheless, confronting all kinds of difficulties, we must spread the Kåñëa consciousness movement with great determination, like that of Prahläda Mahäräja. In spite of being the son of the demon Hiraëyakaçipu, Prahläda never feared the chastisements of the seminal brähmaëa sons of a demoniac father."
