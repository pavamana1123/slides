Prahläda Mahäräja's gurus were of two kinds—Ñaëòa and Amarka, the sons of Çukräcärya in the seminal disciplic succession, were the gurus appointed by his father, but his other guru was the exalted Närada Muni, who had instructed Prahläda when Prahläda was within the womb of his mother. Prahläda Mahäräja responded to the inquiry of his father with the instructions he had received from his spiritual master, Närada. Thus there was again a difference of opinion because Prahläda Mahäräja wanted to relate the best thing he had learned from his spiritual master, whereas Hiraëyakaçipu expected to hear about the politics and diplomacy Prahläda had learned from Ñaëòa and Amarka. Now the dissension between the father and son became increasingly intense as Prahläda Mahäräja began to say what he had learned from his guru Närada Muni."
