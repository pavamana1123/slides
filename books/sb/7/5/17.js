    "translation": "This rascal Prahläda has appeared like a thorn tree in a forest of sandalwood. To cut down sandalwood trees, an axe is needed, and the wood of the thorn tree is very suitable for the handle of such an axe. Lord Viñëu is the axe for cutting down the sandalwood forest of the family of demons, and this Prahläda is the handle for that axe.",

            "content": "Thorn trees generally grow in deserted places, not in sandalwood forests, but the seminal brähmaëas Ñaëòa and Amarka compared the dynasty of the Daitya Hiraëyakaçipu to a sandalwood forest and compared Prahläda Mahäräja to a hard, strong thorn tree that could provide the handle of an axe. They compared Lord Viñëu to the axe itself. An axe alone cannot cut a thorn tree; it needs a handle, which may be made of the wood of a thorn tree. Thus the thorn tree of demoniac civilization can be cut to pieces by the axe of viñëu-bhakti, devotional service to Lord Kåñëa. Some of the members of the demoniac civilization, like Prahläda Mahäräja, may become the handle for the axe, to assist Lord Viñëu, and thus the entire forest of demoniac civilization can be cut to pieces."
