    "translation": "When the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased with the living entity because of his devotional service, one becomes a paëòita and does not make distinctions between enemies, friends and himself. Intelligently, he then thinks, \"Every one of us is an eternal servant of God, and therefore we are not different from one another.\"",

Rather, by the grace of my spiritual master and by the grace of my Lord, Kåñëa, I have now learned that no one is my enemy and no one is my friend. We are all actually eternal servants of Kåñëa, but under the influence of the external energy we think that we are separately situated from the Supreme Personality of Godhead as friends and enemies of one another. This mistaken idea has now been corrected, and therefore, unlike ordinary human beings, I no longer think that I am God and that others are my friends and enemies. Now I am rightly thinking that everyone is an eternal servant of God and that our duty is to serve the supreme master, for then we shall stand on the platform of oneness as servants.\""

            "content": "Demons think of everyone as a friend or enemy, but Vaiñëavas say that since everyone is a servant of the Lord, everyone is on the same platform. Therefore a Vaiñëava treats other living entities neither as friends nor as enemies, but instead tries to spread Kåñëa consciousness, teaching everyone that we are all one as servants of the Supreme Lord but are uselessly wasting our valuable lives by creating nations, communities and other groups of friends and enemies. Everyone should come to the platform of Kåñëa consciousness and thus feel oneness as a servant of the Lord. Although there are 8,400,000 species of life, a Vaiñëava feels this oneness. The Éçopaniñad advises, ekatvam anupaçyataù . A devotee should see the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be situated in everyone's heart and should also see every living entity as an eternal servant of the Lord. This vision is called ekatvam, oneness. Although there is a relationship of master and servant, both master and servant are one because of their spiritual identity. This is also ekatvam. Thus the conception of ekatvam for the Vaiñëava is different from that of the Mäyävädé."

            "content": "Hiraëyakaçipu asked Prahläda Mahäräja how he had become antagonistic to his family. When a family member is killed by an enemy, all the members of the family would naturally be inimical to the murderer, but Hiraëyakaçipu saw that Prahläda had become friendly with the murderer. Therefore he asked, \"Who has created this kind of intelligence in you? Have you developed this consciousness by yourself? Since you are a small boy, someone must have induced you to think this way.\" Prahläda Mahäräja wanted to reply that an attitude favorable toward Viñëu can develop only when the Lord is favorable (sa yadänuvrataù). As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, Kåñëa is the friend of everyone (suhådaà sama-bhütänäà jïätvä mäà çäntim åcchati). The Lord is never an enemy to any of the millions of living entities, but is always a friend to everyone. This is true understanding. If one thinks that the Lord is an enemy, his intelligence is paçu-buddhi, the intelligence of an animal. He falsely thinks, \"I am different from my enemy, and my enemy is different from me. The enemy has done this, and therefore my duty is to kill him.\" This misconception is described in this verse as bheda-gatäsaté. The actual fact is that everyone is a servant of the Lord, as confirmed in Caitanya-caritämåta by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu (jévera 'svarüpa' haya-kåñëera 'nitya-däsa' ). As servants of the Lord, we are one, and there can be no questions of enmity or friendship. If one actually understands that every one of us is a servant of the Lord, where is the question of enemy or friend?"

This is the way of Vaiñëava thinking, Vaikuëöha thinking. There may be rivalries and apparent competition between servants in performing service, but in the Vaikuëöha planets the service of another servant is appreciated, not condemned. This is Vaikuëöha competition. There is no question of enmity between servants. Everyone should be allowed to render service to the Lord to the best of his ability, and everyone should appreciate the service of others. Such are the activities of Vaikuëöha. Since everyone is a servant, everyone is on the same platform and is allowed to serve the Lord according to his ability. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä :"
