    "translation": "Persons who are strongly entrapped by the consciousness of enjoying material life, and who have therefore accepted as their leader or guru a similar blind man attached to external sense objects, cannot understand that the goal of life is to return home, back to Godhead, and engage in the service of Lord Viñëu. As blind men guided by another blind man miss the right path and fall into a ditch, materially attached men led by another materially attached man are bound by the ropes of fruitive labor, which are made of very strong cords, and they continue again and again in materialistic life, suffering the threefold miseries.",

            "content": "Since there must always be a difference of opinion between demons and devotees, Hiraëyakaçipu, when criticized by his son Prahläda Mahäräja, should not have been surprised that Prahläda Mahäräja differed from his way of life. Nonetheless, Hiraëyakaçipu was extremely angry and wanted to rebuke his son for deriding his teacher or spiritual master, who had been born in the brähmaëa family of the great äcärya Çukräcärya. The word çukra means \"semen,\" and äcärya refers to a teacher or guru. Hereditary gurus, or spiritual masters, have been accepted everywhere since time immemorial, but Prahläda Mahäräja declined to accept such a seminal guru or take instruction from him. An actual guru is çrotriya, one who has heard or received perfect knowledge through paramparä, the disciplic succession. Therefore Prahläda Mahäräja did not recognize a seminal spiritual master. Such spiritual masters are not at all interested in Viñëu. Indeed, they are hopeful of material success (bahir-artha-mäninaù). The word bahiù means \"external,\" artha means \"interest,\" and mänina means \"taking very seriously.\" Generally speaking, practically everyone is unaware of the spiritual world. The knowledge of the materialists is restricted within the four-billion-mile limit of this material world, which is in the dark portion of the creation; they do not know that beyond the material world is the spiritual world. Unless one is a devotee of the Lord, one cannot understand the existence of the spiritual world. Gurus, teachers, who are simply interested in this material world are described in this verse as andha, blind. Such blind men may lead many other blind followers without true knowledge of material conditions, but they are not accepted by devotees like Prahläda Mahäräja. Such blind teachers, being interested in the external, material world, are always bound by the strong ropes of material nature."
