Although the teachers tried to educate the boy Prahläda in politics, economics and other material activities, he did not care for their instructions. Instead, he continued to be a pure devotee. Prahläda Mahäräja never liked the idea of discriminating between one's friends and enemies. Because he was spiritually inclined, he was equal toward everyone."

Prahläda Mahäräja replied that a man engrossed in the material consciousness of duality, thinking, \"This is mine, and that belongs to my enemy,\" should give up his householder life and go to the forest to worship the Supreme Lord."

Thus he advised the teachers to take care of the boy so that he would not become a Kåñëa conscious devotee. However, when the teachers inquired from Prahläda Mahäräja why he was going against their teachings, Prahläda Mahäräja taught the teachers that the mentality of ownership is false and that he was therefore trying to become an unalloyed devotee of Lord Viñëu. The teachers, being very angry at this answer, chastised and threatened the boy with many fearful conditions. They taught him to the best of their ability and then brought him before his father."

            "content": "Hiraëyakaçipu affectionately took his son Prahläda on his lap and then inquired from him what the best thing was that he had learned from his teachers. As usual, Prahläda Mahäräja began praising the nine processes of devotional service, such as çravaëam and kértanam. Thus the King of the demons, Hiraëyakaçipu, being extremely angry, chastised the teachers, Ñaëòa and Amarka, for having wrongly trained Prahläda Mahäräja. The so-called teachers informed the King that Prahläda Mahäräja was automatically a devotee and did not listen to their instructions. When they proved themselves innocent, Hiraëyakaçipu inquired from Prahläda where he had learned viñëu-bhakti. Prahläda Mahäräja replied that those who are attached to family life do not develop Kåñëa consciousness, either personally or collectively. Instead, they suffer repeated birth and death in this material world and continue simply chewing the chewed. Prahläda explained that the duty of every man is to take shelter of a pure devotee and thus become eligible to understand Kåñëa consciousness."

            "content": "Enraged at this answer, Hiraëyakaçipu threw Prahläda Mahäräja from his lap. Since Prahläda was so treacherous that he had become a devotee of Viñëu, who had killed his uncle Hiraëyäkña, Hiraëyakaçipu asked his assistants to kill him. The assistants of Hiraëyakaçipu struck Prahläda with sharp weapons, threw him under the feet of elephants, subjected him to hellish conditions, threw him from the peak of a mountain and tried to kill him in thousands of other ways, but they were unsuccessful. Hiraëyakaçipu therefore became increasingly afraid of his son Prahläda Mahäräja and arrested him. The sons of Hiraëyakaçipu's spiritual master, Çukräcärya, began teaching Prahläda in their own way, but Prahläda Mahäräja did not accept their instructions. While the teachers were absent from the classroom, Prahläda Mahäräja began to preach Kåñëa consciousness in the school, and by his instructions all his class friends, the sons of the demons, became devotees like him."
