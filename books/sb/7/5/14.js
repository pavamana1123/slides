Similarly, for all living entities to be attracted toward Kåñëa is natural, and therefore the Lord's real name is Kåñëa, meaning He who attracts everyone and everything. The typical examples of such attraction are found in Våndävana, where everything and everyone is attracted by Kåñëa. The elderly persons like Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodädevé, the friends like Çrédämä, Sudämä and the other cowherd boys, the gopés like Çrématé Rädhäräëé and Her associates, and even the birds, beasts, cows and calves are attracted. The flowers and fruits in the gardens are attracted, the waves of the Yamunä are attracted, and the land, sky, trees, plants, animals and all other living beings are attracted by Kåñëa. This is the natural situation of everything in Våndävana."

This is the difference between the spiritual and material worlds. Hiraëyakaçipu, who was in the material world, was attracted by women and money, whereas Prahläda Mahäräja, being in his natural position, was attracted by Kåñëa. In replying to Hiraëyakaçipu's question about why Prahläda Mahäräja had a deviant view, Prahläda said that his view was not deviant, for the natural position of everyone is to be attracted by Kåñëa. Hiraëyakaçipu found this view deviant, Prahläda said, because of being unnaturally unattracted by Kåñëa. Hiraëyakaçipu therefore needed purification."

Unless one is free from all material desire (anyäbhiläñitä-çünyam [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11]), one cannot be attracted by Kåñëa."
