    "translation": "The great saint Närada Muni continued: The great soul Prahläda Mahäräja became silent after saying this to his teachers, Ñaëòa and Amarka, the seminal sons of Çukräcärya. These so-called brähmaëas then became angry at him. Because they were servants of Hiraëyakaçipu, they were very sorry, and to chastise Prahläda Mahäräja they spoke as follows.",

The brähmaëas Ñaëòa and Amarka, being seminal sons of Çukräcärya, did not actually possess real brahminical qualifications, for they engaged as servants of Hiraëyakaçipu. An actual brähmaëa is very much satisfied to see anyone, not to speak of his disciple, become a devotee of Lord Kåñëa. Such brähmaëas are meant to satisfy the supreme master. A brähmaëa is strictly prohibited from becoming a servant of anyone else, for that is the business of dogs and çüdras. A dog must satisfy his master, but a brähmaëa does not have to satisfy anyone; he is simply meant to satisfy Kåñëa (änukülyena kåñëänuçélanam ). That is the real qualification of a brähmaëa. Because Ñaëòa and Amarka were seminal brähmaëas and had become servants of such a master as Hiraëyakaçipu, they unnecessarily wanted to chastise Prahläda Mahäräja."
