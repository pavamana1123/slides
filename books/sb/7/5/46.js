    "translation": "Although he is very near to me and is merely a child, he is situated in complete fearlessness. He resembles a dog's curved tail, which can never be straightened, because he never forgets my misbehavior and his connection with his master, Lord Viñëu.",

Çunaù çepa is also the name of the second son of Ajégarta. He was sold to Hariçcandra, but he later took shelter of Viçvämitra, Hariçcandra's enemy, and never left his side."
