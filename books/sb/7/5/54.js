As will be seen from the following verses, however, Prahläda Mahäräja was not very much interested in playing. Instead, he wanted to utilize every moment for advancing in Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore, as indicated in this verse by the word kåta-kñaëaiù, at the opportune moment when it was possible to preach about Kåñëa consciousness, Prahläda Mahäräja used the time as follows."
