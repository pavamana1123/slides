In other words, Prahläda Mahäräja would be elevated to särüpya liberation, and in that sense he resembled Lord Viñëu. Therefore Prahläda was to be killed by Hiraëyakaçipu. Devotees, Vaiñëavas, attain the liberations of särüpya, sälokya, särñöi and sämépya, whereas the Mäyävädés are supposed to attain the liberation known as säyujya. Säyujya-mukti, however, is not very secure, whereas särüpya-mukti, sälokya-mukti, särñöi-mukti and sämépya-mukti are most certain. Although the servants of Lord Viñëu, Näräyaëa, in the Vaikuëöha planets are equally situated with the Lord, the devotees there know very well that the Lord is the master whereas they are servants."
