            "content": "In our Kåñëa consciousness movement, the tactic of dressing oneself like an ordinary karmé is necessary because everyone in the demoniac kingdom is against the Vaiñëava teachings. Kåñëa consciousness is not at all to the liking of the demons of the present age. As soon as they see a Vaiñëava dressed in saffron garments with beads on his neck and tilaka on his forehead, they are immediately irritated. They criticize the Vaiñëavas by sarcastically saying Hare Kåñëa, and some people also chant Hare Kåñëa sincerely. In either case, since Hare Kåñëa is absolute, whether one chants it jokingly or sincerely, it will have its effect. The Vaiñëavas are pleased when the demons chant Hare Kåñëa because this shows that the Hare Kåñëa movement is taking ground. The greater demons, like Hiraëyakaçipu, are always prepared to chastise the Vaiñëavas, and they try to make arrangements so that Vaiñëavas will not come to sell their books and preach Kåñëa consciousness. Thus what was done by Hiraëyakaçipu long, long ago is still being done. That is the way of materialistic life. Demons or materialists do not at all like the advancement of Kåñëa consciousness, and they try to hinder it in many ways. Yet the preachers of Kåñëa consciousness must go forward—in their Vaiñëava dress or any other dress—for the purpose of preaching. Cäëakya Paëòita says that if an honest person deals with a great cheater, it is necessary for him to become a cheater also, not for the purpose of cheating but to make his preaching successful."
