            "content": "In this verse the words prahrädaà grähayäm äsa are important. The words grähayäm äsa literally mean that they tried to induce Prahläda Mahäräja to accept the paths of dharma, artha and käma (religion, economic development and sense gratification). People are generally preoccupied with these three concerns, without interest in the path of liberation. Hiraëyakaçipu, the father of Prahläda Mahäräja, was simply interested in gold and sense enjoyment. The word hiraëya means \"gold,\" and kaçipu refers to soft cushions and bedding on which people enjoy sense gratification. The word prahläda, however, refers to one who is always joyful in understanding Brahman (brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä ). Prahläda means prasannätmä, always joyful. Prahläda was always joyful in worshiping the Lord, but in accordance with the instructions of Hiraëyakaçipu, the teachers were interested in teaching him about material things. Materialistic persons think that the path of religion is meant for improving their material conditions. The materialist goes to a temple to worship many varieties of demigods just to receive some benediction to improve his material life. He goes to a sädhu or so-called svämé to take advantage of an easy method for achieving material opulence. In the name of religion, the so-called sädhus try to satisfy the senses of the materialists by showing them shortcuts to material opulence. Sometimes they give some talisman or blessing. Sometimes they attract materialistic persons by producing gold. Then they declare themselves God, and foolish materialists are attracted to them for economic development. As a result of this process of cheating, others are reluctant to accept a religious process, and instead they advise people in general to work for material advancement. This is going on all over the world. Not only now but since time immemorial, no one is interested in mokña, liberation. There are four principles—dharma (religion), artha (economic development), käma (sense gratification) and mokña (liberation). People accept religion to become materially opulent. And why should one be materially opulent? For sense gratification. Thus people prefer these three märgas, the three paths of materialistic life. No one is interested in liberation, and bhagavad-bhakti, devotional service to the Lord, is above even liberation. Therefore the process of devotional service, Kåñëa consciousness, is extremely difficult to understand. This will be explained later by Prahläda Mahäräja. The teachers Ñaëòa and Amarka tried to induce Prahläda Mahäräja to accept the materialistic way of life, but actually their attempt was a failure."
