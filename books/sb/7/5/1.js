Çukräcärya became the priest of the atheists, especially Hiraëyakaçipu, and thus his two sons, Ñaëòa and Amarka, resided near Hiraëyakaçipu's residence. Çukräcärya should not have become the priest of Hiraëyakaçipu because Hiraëyakaçipu and his followers were all atheists. A brähmaëa should become the priest of a person interested in the advancement of spiritual culture. The very name Çukräcärya, however, indicates a person interested in obtaining benefits for his sons and descendants, regardless of how the money comes. A real brähmaëa would not become a priest for atheistic men."
