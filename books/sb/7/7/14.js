            "content": "One should not remain in a secluded place with a woman, even one's mother, sister, or daughter. Nonetheless, although one is strictly prohibited from staying with a woman in a secluded place, Närada Muni gave shelter to Prahläda Mahäräja's young mother, who rendered service to him with great devotion and faith. Does this mean that Närada Muni transgressed the Vedic injunctions? Certainly he did not. Such injunctions are intended for mundane creatures, but Närada Muni is transcendental to mundane categories. Närada Muni is a great saint and is transcendentally situated. Therefore, although he was a young man, he could give shelter to a young woman and accept her service. Haridäsa Öhäkura also spoke with a young woman, a prostitute, in the dead of night, but the woman could not deviate his mind. Instead, she became a Vaiñëavé, a pure devotee, by the benediction of Haridäsa Öhäkura. Ordinary persons, however, should not imitate such highly elevated devotees. Ordinary persons must strictly observe the rules and regulations by staying aloof from the association of women. No one should imitate Närada Muni or Haridäsa Öhäkura. It is said, vaiñëavera kriyä-mudrä vijïe nä bujhaya. Even if a man is very advanced in learning, he cannot understand the behavior of a Vaiñëava. Anyone can take shelter of a pure Vaiñëava, without fear. Therefore in the previous verse it has been distinctly said, devarñer antike säkuto-bhayä: Kayädhu, the mother of Prahläda Mahäräja, stayed under the protection of Närada Muni without fear from any direction. Similarly, Närada Muni, in his transcendental position, stayed with the young woman without fear of deviation. Närada Muni, Haridäsa Öhäkura and similar äcäryas especially empowered to broadcast the glories of the Lord cannot be brought down to the material platform. Therefore one is strictly forbidden to think that the äcärya is an ordinary human being (guruñu nara-matiù)."
