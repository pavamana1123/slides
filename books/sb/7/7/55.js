Just as those who are greedy see everything as a source of money-making and those who are lusty see everything as being conducive to sex, the most perfect devotee, Prahläda Mahäräja, saw Näräyaëa even within a stone column. This does not mean, however, that we must accept the words daridra-näräyaëa, which have been manufactured by some unscrupulous person. One who actually envisions Näräyaëa everywhere makes no distinction between the poor and the rich. To single out the daridra-näräyaëas, or poor Näräyaëa, and reject the dhani-näräyaëa, or rich Näräyaëa, is not the vision of a devotee. Rather, that is the imperfect vision of materialistic persons."
