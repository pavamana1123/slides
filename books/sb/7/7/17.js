Even when Prahläda Mahäräja was a baby within the womb of his mother, he became fully convinced of the existence of the supreme power because of hearing the powerful instructions of Närada and understood how to attain perfection in life by bhakti-yoga. These are the most important understandings in spiritual knowledge."

Become bona fide Vaiñëavas.\" A devotee of the Lord desires for everyone to take to Kåñëa consciousness. Unfortunately, however, people sometimes do not have staunch faith in the words of the spiritual master who comes by the disciplic succession, and therefore they are unable to understand transcendental knowledge. The spiritual master must be in the line of authorized disciplic succession, like Prahläda Mahäräja, who received the knowledge from Närada. If the class friends of Prahläda Mahäräja, the sons of demons, were to accept the truth through Prahläda, they would certainly also become fully aware of transcendental knowledge."

The Lord has created wonderful universes by His expert knowledge. Unless one is extremely expert, he cannot understand the expert management of the supreme expert. One can understand, however, if one is fortunate enough to meet a bona fide spiritual master coming in the disciplic succession from Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva, Mother Lakñmé or the Kumäras. These four sampradäyas, or disciplic successions of knowledge and transcendence, are called the Brahma-sampradäya, Rudra-sampradäya, Çré-sampradäya, and Kumära-sampradäya. Sampradäya-vihénä ye manträs te niñphalä matäù. The knowledge of the Supreme received from such a sampradäya, or disciplic succession, can give one enlightenment. If one does not take to the path of disciplic succession, it is not possible for one to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one understands the Supreme Lord through devotional service with faith in the disciplic succession and then advances further, he awakens his natural love for God, and then his success in life is assured."
