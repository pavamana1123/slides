Although one is acting according to false ambitions, he thinks he can improve his material conditions by his activities. The Vedas enjoin that one should not try to increase happiness or decrease distress, for this is futile. Tasyaiva hetoù prayateta kovidaù. One should work for self-realization, not for economic development, which is impossible to improve. Without endeavor, one can get the amount of happiness and distress for which he is destined, and one cannot change this. Therefore, it is better to use one's time for advancement in the spiritual life of Kåñëa consciousness. One should not waste his valuable life as a human being. It is better to utilize this life for developing Kåñëa consciousness, without ambitions for so-called happiness."
