            "content": "These are words of intelligence. Everyone should know that in every stage of life we are dependent upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the dharma, religion, which we accept should be that which is recommended by Prahläda Mahäräja-bhägavata-dharma. This is the instruction of Kåñëa: sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja . To take shelter of the lotus feet of Kåñëa means to act according to the rules and regulations of bhägavata-dharma, devotional service. As far as economic development is concerned, we should discharge our occupational duties but fully depend on the lotus feet of the Lord for the results. Karmaëy evädhikäras te mä phaleñu kadäcana: \"You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action.\" According to one's position, one should perform his duties, but for the results one should fully depend upon Kåñëa. Narottama däsa Öhäkura sings that our only desire should be to perform the duties of Kåñëa consciousness. We should not be misled by the karma-mémäàsä philosophy, which concludes that if we work seriously the results will come automatically. This is not a fact. The ultimate result depends upon the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In devotional service, therefore, the devotee completely depends upon the Lord and honestly performs his occupational duties. Therefore Prahläda Mahäräja advised his friends to depend completely on Kåñëa and worship Him in devotional service."
