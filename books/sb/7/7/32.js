This statement is sometimes misunderstood by unscrupulous persons who wrongly conclude that because Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is situated in every living entity, every living entity is therefore Hari. Such foolish persons do not distinguish between the ätmä and the Paramätmä, who are situated in every body. The ätma is the living entity, and the Paramätmä is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The individual living entity, however, is different from the Paramätmä, the Supreme Lord. Therefore hariù sarveñu bhüteñu means that Hari is situated as Paramätmä, not as ätmä, although ätmä is a part of Paramätmä. Offering respect to every living entity means offering respect to the Paramätmä situated in every living entity. One should not misunderstand every living entity to be the Paramätmä. Sometimes unscrupulous persons designate a living entity as daridra-näräyaëa, svämé-näräyaëa, this Näräyaëa or that Näräyaëa. One should clearly understand that although Näräyaëa is situated in the core of the heart of every living entity, the living entity never becomes Näräyaëa."
