            "content": "\"O son of Påthä, those who take shelter in Me—though they be lowborn, women, vaiçyas [merchants] or çüdras [workers]—can approach the supreme destination.\" The word päpa-yoni refers to those who are less than çüdras, but even though a woman may not be päpa-yoni, because of being less intelligent she sometimes forgets devotional instructions. For those who are strong enough, however, there is no question of forgetting. Women are generally attached to material enjoyment, and because of this tendency they sometimes forget devotional instructions. But if even a woman practices devotional service strictly, according to the rules and regulations, the statement by the Lord Himself that she can return to Godhead (te 'pi yänti paräà gatim) is not at all astonishing. One must take shelter of the Lord and rigidly follow the rules and regulations. Then, regardless of what one is, one will return home, back to Godhead. Prahläda Mahäräja's mother was more concerned with protecting the child in the womb and was very anxious to see her husband return. Therefore she could not consider very seriously the sublime instructions of Närada Muni."
