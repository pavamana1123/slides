The Lord promises in Bhagavad-gétä , kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati. This is a declaration by the Supreme Personality of Godhead that His devotee cannot be killed by demons. Prahläda Mahäräja is the vivid example of the truth of this promise. Närada Muni told the King of heaven, \"it would be impossible for you to kill the child, even though you are demigods, and certainly it would be impossible for others.\""
