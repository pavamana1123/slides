    "synonyms": "ätmä—the spirit soul, the part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; nityaù—without birth or death; avyayaù—with no possibility of dwindling; çuddhaù—without the material contamination of attachment and detachment; ekaù—individual; kñetra-jïaù—who knows and is therefore different from the material body; äçrayaù—the original foundation; avikriyaù—not undergoing changes like the body; sva-dåk—self-illuminated; hetuù—the cause of all causes; vyäpakaù—spreading throughout the body in the form of consciousness; asaìgé—not depending on the body (free to transmigrate from one body to another); anävåtaù—not covered by material contamination; etaiù—by all these; dvädaçabhiù—twelve; vidvän—a person who is not foolish but fully aware of things as they are; ätmanaù—of the spirit soul; lakñaëaiù—symptoms; paraiù—transcendental; aham—I (\"I am this body\"); mama—mine (\"everything in relationship with this body is mine\"); iti—thus; asat-bhävam—a false conception of life; deha-ädau—identifying oneself with the material body and then with one's wife, children, family, community, nation and so on; moha-jam—produced from illusory knowledge; tyajet—must give up.",
    "translation": "\"Ätmä\" refers to the Supreme Lord or the living entities. Both of them are spiritual, free from birth and death, free from deterioration and free from material contamination. They are individual, they are the knowers of the external body, and they are the foundation or shelter of everything. They are free from material change, they are self-illuminated, they are the cause of all causes, and they are all-pervading. They have nothing to do with the material body, and therefore they are always uncovered. With these transcendental qualities, one who is actually learned must give up the illusory conception of life, in which one thinks, \"I am this material body, and everything in relationship with this body is mine.\"",

            "content": "In Bhagavad-gétä  Lord Kåñëa clearly says, mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù: \"All the living entities are part of Me.\" Therefore the living entities are qualitatively the same as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the leader, the Supreme among all the living entities. In the Vedas it is said, nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13): the Lord is the chief individual living entity, the leader of the subordinate living entities. Because the living entities are parts or samples of God, their qualities are not different from those of the Supreme Lord. The living entities have the same qualities as the Lord, just as a drop of sea water is composed of the same chemicals as the great sea itself. Thus there is oneness in quality but a difference in quantity. One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by understanding the sample, the living entity, because all the qualities of God exist in a minute quantity in the living entities. There is oneness, but God is great whereas the living entities are extremely small. Aëor aëéyän mahato mahéyän (Kaöha Upaniñad 1.2.20). The living entities are smaller than the atom, but God is greater than the greatest. Our conception of greatness may be represented by the sky because we think of the sky as being unlimitedly big, but God is bigger than the sky. Similarly, we have knowledge that the living entities are smaller than atoms, being one ten-thousandth the size of the tip of a hair, yet the quality of being the supreme cause of all causes exists in the living entity as well as in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, it is due to the presence of the living entity that the body exists and bodily changes take place. Similarly, it is because the Supreme Lord is within this universe that the changes dictated by the material laws occur."

Everything, material and spiritual, including earth, water, air, fire, sky and the living entities, exists on the platform of spirit soul. Although everything is an emanation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should not think that the Supreme Lord is dependent upon anything else."

Similarly, the Lord is conscious of the gigantic cosmic manifestation. This is confirmed in the Vedas. Yasmin dyauù påthivé cäntarékñam. Vijïätäram adhikena vijänéyät. Ekam evädvitéyam. Ätma-jyotiù samräò ihoväca. Sa imän lokän asåjata. Satyaà jïänam anantam. Asaìgo hy ayaà puruñaù. pürëasya pürëam ädäya pürëam evävaçiñyate . All these Vedic injunctions prove that both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the minute soul are individual. One is great, and the other is small, but both of them are the cause of all causes—the corporally limited and the universally unlimited."

            "content": "We should always remember that although we are equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality, we are never equal to Him in quantity. Persons with a small fund of intelligence, finding themselves equal in quality with God, foolishly think that they are equal in quantity also. Their intelligence is called aviçuddha-buddhayaù-unpolished or contaminated intelligence. When such persons, after endeavoring hard for many, many lives to understand the supreme cause, are finally in actual knowledge of Kåñëa, Väsudeva, they surrender unto Him (väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù ). This is illusion. One must give up his illusory conception and thus become fully aware of everything."
