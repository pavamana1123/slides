    "translation": "Just as the fruits and flowers of a tree in due course of time undergo six changes—birth, existence, growth, transformation, dwindling and then death—the material body, which is obtained by the spirit soul under different circumstances, undergoes similar changes. However, there are no such changes for the spirit soul.",

He is not slain when the body is slain.\" The spirit soul is eternal, being freed from waste and change, which take place because of the material body. The example of a tree and its fruits and flowers is very simple and clear. A tree stands for many, many years, but with the seasonal changes its fruits and flowers undergo six transformations. The foolish theory of modern chemists that life can be produced by chemical interactions cannot be accepted as truth. The birth of a human being's material body takes place due to a mixture of the ovum and semen, but the history of birth is that although the ovum and semen mix together after sex, there is not always pregnancy. Unless the soul enters the mixture, there is no possibility of pregnancy, but when the soul takes shelter of the mixture the body takes birth, exists, grows, transforms and dwindles, and ultimately it is vanquished. The fruits and flowers of a tree seasonally come and go, but the tree continues to stand. Similarly, the transmigrating soul accepts various bodies, which undergo six transformations, but the soul remains permanently the same (ajo nityaù çäçvato 'yaà puräëo na hanyate hanyamäne çarére ). The soul is eternal and ever existing, but the bodies accepted by the soul are changing."

One who understands this truth should not be very much anxious about the maintenance of his body. There is no possibility of maintaining the body permanently or eternally. Antavanta ime dehä nityasyoktäù çarériëaù. This is the statement of Bhagavad-gétä . The material body is antavat (perishable), but the soul within the body is eternal (nityasyoktäù çarériëaù). Lord Viñëu and the individual souls, who are part and parcel of Him, are both eternal. Nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13). Lord Viñëu is the chief living being, whereas the individual living entities are parts of Lord Viñëu. All the various grades of bodies—from the gigantic universal body to the small body of an ant—are perishable, but the Supersoul and the soul, being equal in quality, both exist eternally. This is further explained in the next verses."
