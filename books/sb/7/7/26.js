    "synonyms": "ebhiù—by these; tri-varëaiù—composed of the three modes of nature; paryastaiù—completely rejected (due to not touching the living force); buddhi—of intelligence; bhedaiù—the differentiations; kriyä-udbhavaiù—produced from different activities; svarüpam—the constitutional position; ätmanaù—of the self; budhyet—one should understand; gandhaiù—by the aromas; väyum—the air; iva—exactly like; anvayät—from close connection.",
    "translation": "As one can understand the presence of the air by the aromas it carries, so, under the guidance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can understand the living soul by these three divisions of intelligence. These three divisions, however, are not the soul; they are constituted of the three modes and are born of activities.",

Thus the soul is the observer of these three states. Actually, the activities of the body are not the activities of the soul. The soul is different from the body. Just as aromas are distinct from the material vehicle in which they are carried, the soul is unattached to material activities. This analysis can be considered by a person who is fully under the shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. This is confirmed by the Vedic injunction yasmin vijïäte sarvam evaà vijïätaà bhavati (Muëòaka Upaniñad 1.3). If one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can automatically understand everything else. Because of not taking shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, even great scholars, scientists, philosophers and religionists are always bewildered. This is confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

Ultimately, when one's intelligence becomes clear through devotional service, one is situated in buddhi-yoga. This also is explained in Bhagavad-gétä ( dadämi buddhi-yogaà taà yena mäm upayänti te). When devotional service develops and one's intelligence becomes clear, one can use his intelligence to return home, back to Godhead."
