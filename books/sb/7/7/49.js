The Lord is the original cause of the material body and the soul, which is expanded by His marginal energy. The Supreme Lord is the dearmost object of all living entities. Prahläda Mahäräja therefore advised his class friends, the sons of the demons, to take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead again."
