For example, when one considers his body—his head, his hands and so on-one can certainly understand the difference between the spirit soul and the body. No one says, \"I head.\" Everyone says, \"My head.\" Thus there are two entities—the head and \"I.\" They are not identical, although they appear to be one conglomeration."

If the soul is within, the body, head, hands and legs grow, but otherwise they do not. A dead child does not grow up, for the soul is not present. If by a careful analysis of the body one still cannot find the existence of the soul, this is due to his ignorance. How can a gross man fully engaged in materialistic activities understand the soul, which is a small particle of spirit one ten-thousandth the size of the tip of a hair? Such a person foolishly thinks that the material body has grown from a combination of chemicals, although he cannot find them. The Vedas inform us, however, that chemical combinations do not constitute the living force; the living force is the ätmä and Paramätmä, and the body grows on the basis of that living force. The fruit of a tree grows and undergoes six kinds of change because of the presence of the tree. If there were no tree, there could be no question of the growth and maturity of fruit. Therefore, beyond the existence of the body are the Paramätmä and ätmä within the body. This is the first understanding of spiritual knowledge explained in Bhagavad-gétä. Dehino 'smin yathä dehe :"

The Vedas enjoin, sarvam khalv idaà brahma: everything is Brahman or an expansion of Brahman's energies. Sütre maëi-gaëä iva: everything rests on the Lord, just like pearls strung together on a thread. The thread is the principal Brahman. He is the supreme cause, the Supreme Lord upon whom everything rests (mattaù parataraà nänyat ). Thus we must study the ätmä and Paramätmä—the individual soul and the Supersoul—upon whom the entire material cosmic manifestation rests. This is explained by the Vedic statement yato vä imäni bhütäni jäya nte. yena jätäni jévanti."
