    "translation": "My dear friends, O sons of the demons, you cannot please the Supreme Personality of Godhead by becoming perfect brähmaëas, demigods or great saints or by becoming perfectly good in etiquette or vast learning. None of these qualifications can awaken the pleasure of the Lord. Nor by charity, austerity, sacrifice, cleanliness or vows can one satisfy the Lord. The Lord is pleased only if one has unflinching, unalloyed devotion to Him. Without sincere devotional service, everything is simply a show.",

Material elevation to life as a brähmaëa, demigod, åñi and so on are not causes for developing love of Godhead, but if one sincerely engages in the service of the Lord, his Kåñëa consciousness is complete. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä :"
