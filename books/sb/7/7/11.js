This is called understanding by the paramparä system. Indra and the demigods did not know that a great devotee was in the womb of Kayädhu, the wife of Hiraëyakaçipu, but they accepted the authoritative statements of Närada Muni and immediately offered their respects to the devotee by circumambulating the woman in whose womb he was living. To understand God and the devotee by the paramparä system is the process of knowledge. There is no need to speculate about God and His devotee. One should accept the statements of a bona fide devotee and thus try to understand."
