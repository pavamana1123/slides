    "translation": "Närada Muni said: Although Prahläda Mahäräja was born in a family of asuras, he was the greatest of all devotees. Having thus been questioned by his class friends, the sons of the asuras, he remembered the words spoken to him by me and replied to his friends as follows.",

One cannot imagine how the baby in embryo could hear Närada, but this is spiritual life; progress in spiritual life cannot be obstructed by any material condition. This is called ahaituky apratihatä. Reception of spiritual knowledge is never checked by any material condition. Thus Prahläda Mahäräja, from his very childhood, spoke spiritual knowledge to his class friends, and certainly it was effective, although all of them were children."
