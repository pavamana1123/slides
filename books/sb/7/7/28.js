    "translation": "Therefore, my dear friends, O sons of the demons, your duty is to take to Kåñëa consciousness, which can burn the seed of fruitive activities artificially created by the modes of material nature and stop the flow of the intelligence in wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep. In other words, when one takes to Kåñëa consciousness, his ignorance is immediately dissipated.",

            "content": "\"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\" By the practice of bhakti-yoga, one immediately comes to the spiritual platform, transcendental to the actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature. The root of ignorance is material consciousness, which must be killed by spiritual consciousness, or Kåñëa consciousness. The word béja-nirharaëam refers to burning the root cause of material life to ashes. In the Mediné dictionary, yoga is explained by its result: yoge 'pürvärtha-sampräptau saìgati-dhyäna-yuktiñu. When one is put into an awkward position because of ignorance, the process by which one can be freed from this entanglement is called yoga. This is also called liberation. Muktir hitvänyathä-rüpaà svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù . Mukti means giving up one's position in ignorance or illusion, by which one thinks in a way contrary to his constitutional position. Returning to one's constitutional position is called mukti, and the process by which one does this is called yoga. Thus yoga is above karma, jïäna and säìkhya. Indeed, yoga is the ultimate goal of life. Kåñëa therefore advised Arjuna to become a yogé (tasmäd yogé bhavärjuna). Lord Kåñëa further advised in Bhagavad-gétä that the first-class yogé is he who has come to the platform of devotional service."

By practicing this best of all yoga systems, one is liberated from the material condition."
