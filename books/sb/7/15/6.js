            "content": "As mentioned above, it is recommended that everyone distribute prasäda, considering every living being a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Even in feeding the poor, one should distribute prasäda. In Kali-yuga there is a scarcity of food almost every year, and thus philanthropists spend lavishly to feed the poor. For this they invent the term daridra-näräyaëa-sevä. This is prohibited. One should distribute sumptuous prasäda, considering everyone a part of the Supreme Lord, but one should not juggle words to make a poor man Näräyaëa. Everyone is related to the Supreme Lord, but one should not mistakenly think that because one is related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has become the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa. Such a Mäyäväda philosophy is extremely dangerous, especially for a devotee. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has therefore strictly forbidden us to associate with Mäyävädé philosophers. Mäyävädi-bhäñya çunile haya sarva-näça: if one associates with the Mäyäväda philosophy, his devotional life is doomed."
