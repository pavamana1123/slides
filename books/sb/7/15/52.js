    "translation": "A twice-born brähmaëa [dvija] gains his life by the grace of his parents through the process of purification known as garbhädhäna. There are also other processes of purification, until the end of life, when the funeral ceremony [antyeñöi-kriyä] is performed. Thus in due course a qualified brähmaëa becomes uninterested in materialistic activities and sacrifices, but he offers the sensual sacrifices, in full knowledge, into the working senses, which are illuminated by the fire of knowledge.",

Pravåtti-märga, or the inclination to stay in the material world to enjoy varieties of sense gratification, has been explained in the previous verse. Now, in this verse, it is explained that one who has perfect brahminical knowledge rejects the process of elevation to higher planets and accepts nivåtti-märga; in other words, he prepares himself to go back home, back to Godhead. Those who are not brähmaëas but atheists do not know what is pravåtti-märga or nivåtti-märga; they simply want to obtain pleasure at any cost. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore training devotees to give up the pravåtti-märga and accept the nivåtti-märga in order to return home, back to Godhead. This is a little difficult to understand, but it is very easy if one takes to Kåñëa consciousness seriously and tries to understand Kåñëa. A Kåñëa conscious person can understand that performing yajïa according to the karma-käëòa system is a useless waste of time and that merely giving up the karma-käëòa and accepting the process of speculation is also unfruitful. Therefore Narottama däsa Öhäkura has sung in his prema-bhakti-candrikä:"
