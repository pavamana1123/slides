    "translation": "A person desiring liberation for his forefathers or himself should give charity to a brähmaëa who adheres to impersonal monism [jïäna-niñöhä]. In the absence of such an advanced brähmaëa, charity may be given to a brähmaëa addicted to fruitive activities [karma-käëòa].",

            "content": "There are two processes by which to get free from material bondage. One involves jïäna-käëòa and karma-käëòa, and the other involves upäsanä-käëòa. Vaiñëavas never want to merge into the existence of the Supreme; rather, they want to be everlastingly servants of the Lord to render loving service unto Him. In this verse the words änantyam icchatä refer to persons who desire to achieve liberation from material bondage and merge into the existence of the Lord. Devotees, however, whose objective is to associate personally with the Lord, have no desire to accept the activities of karma-käëòa or jïäna-käëòa, for pure devotional service is above both karma-käëòa and jïäna-käëòa. Anyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11]. In pure devotional service there is not even a pinch of jïäna or karma. Consequently, when Vaiñëavas distribute charity, they do not need to find a brähmaëa performing the activities of jïäna-käëòa or karma-käëòa. The best example in this regard is provided by Advaita Gosvämé, who, after performing the çräddha ceremony for his father, offered charity to Haridäsa Öhäkura, although it was known to everyone that Haridäsa Öhäkura was born in a Mohammedan family, not a brähmaëa family, and was not interested in the activities of jïäna-käëòa or karma-käëòa."

Indeed, all respect should be given to him, and whatever he offers should be accepted. Such devotees are as worshipable as I am.\" (Hari-bhakti-viläsa 10.127) Therefore, even if not born in a brähmaëa family, a devotee, because of his devotion to the Lord, is above all kinds of brähmaëas, whether they be karma-käëòés or jïäna-käëòés."

It is the conclusion of the çästra that instead of feeding many jïäna-käëòé or karma-käëòé brähmaëas, it is better to feed a pure Vaiñëava, regardless of where he comes from.
