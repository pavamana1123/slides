    "synonyms": "dharma-artham—in religion or economic development; api—indeed; na—not; éheta—should try to obtain; yäträ-artham—just to maintain the body and soul together; vä—either; adhanaù—one who has no wealth; dhanam—money; anéhä—the desirelessness; anéhamänasya—of a person who does not endeavor even to earn his livelihood; mahä-aheù—the great serpent known as the python; iva—like; våtti-dä—which obtains its livelihood without endeavor.",
    "translation": "Even if a man is poor, he should not endeavor to improve his economic condition just to maintain his body and soul together or to become a famous religionist. Just as a great python, although lying in one place, not endeavoring for its livelihood, gets the food it needs to maintain body and soul, one who is desireless also obtains his livelihood without endeavor.",

            "content": "Human life is simply meant for developing Kåñëa consciousness. One need not even try to earn a livelihood to maintain body and soul together. This is illustrated here by the example of the great python, which lies in one place, never going here and there to earn a livelihood to maintain itself, and yet is maintained by the grace of the Lord. As advised by Närada Muni . Why should one approach a person who is blind with wealth? Rather, one should depend on Kåñëa, and He will give everything. All the members of our Kåñëa consciousness movement, whether they be gåhasthas or sannyäsés, should try to spread the Kåñëa consciousness movement with determination, and Kåñëa will supply all necessities. The process of äjagara-våtti, the means of livelihood of a python, is very much appreciated in this regard. Even though one may be very poor, he should simply try to advance in Kåñëa consciousness and not endeavor to earn his livelihood."
