Närada Muni is explaining this in relation to his own life. The saìkértana movement is important, for regardless of whether one is a çüdra, vaiçya, mleccha, yavana or whatever, if one associates with a pure devotee, follows his instructions and serves the pure devotee, his life is successful. This is bhakti. Änukülyena kåñëänuçélanam . Bhakti consists of serving Kåñëa and His devotees very favorably. Anyäbhiläñitä-çünyam [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11]. If one has no desire other than to serve Kåñëa and His devotee, then his life is successful. This is explained by Närada Muni through this practical example from his own life."
