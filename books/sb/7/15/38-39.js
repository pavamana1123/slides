    "synonyms": "gåhasthasya—for a person situated in householder life; kriyä-tyägaù—to give up the duty of a householder; vrata-tyägaù—to give up vows and austerity; vaöoù—for a brahmacäré; api—also; tapasvinaù—for a vänaprastha, one who has adopted a life of austerities; gräma-sevä—to live in a village and serve the people therein; bhikñoù—for a sannyäsé who lived by begging alms; indriya-lolatä—addicted to sense enjoyment; äçrama—of the spiritual orders of life; apasadäù—the most abominable; hi—indeed; ete—all these; khalu—indeed; äçrama-viòambanäù—imitating and therefore cheating the different spiritual orders; deva-mäyä-vimüòhän—who are bewildered by the external energy of the Supreme Lord; tän—them; upekñeta—one should reject and not accept as genuine; anukampayä—or by compassion (teach them real life).",
    "translation": "It is abominable for a person living in the gåhastha-äçrama to give up the regulative principles, for a brahmacäré not to follow the brahmacäré vows while living under the care of the guru, for a vänaprastha to live in the village and engage in so-called social activities, or for a sannyäsé to be addicted to sense gratification. One who acts in this way is to be considered the lowest renegade. Such a pretender is bewildered by the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should either reject him from any position, or taking compassion upon him, teach him, if possible, to resume his original position.",

            "content": "We have repeatedly stressed that human culture does not begin unless one takes to the principles of varëäçrama-dharma. Although gåhastha life is a concession for the enjoyment of sex, one cannot enjoy sex without following the rules and regulations of householder life. Furthermore, as already instructed, a brahmacäré must live under the care of the guru: brahmacäré guru-kule vasan dänto guror hitam . If a brahmacäré does not live under the care of the guru, if a vänaprastha engages in ordinary activities, or if a sannyäsé is greedy and eats meat, eggs and all kinds of nonsense for the satisfaction of his tongue, he is a cheater and should immediately be rejected as unimportant. Such persons should be shown compassion, and if one has sufficient strength one should teach them to stop them from following the wrong path in life. Otherwise one should reject them and pay them no attention."
