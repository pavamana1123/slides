Not only the Päëòavas but everyone who sincerely accepts the instructions of Kåñëa can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is. After instructing Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja, Närada Muni prays for the Lord's blessings that He be pleased with everyone and that everyone become perfect in God consciousness and return home, back to Godhead."
