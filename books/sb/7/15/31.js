    "translation": "My dear King, in a sacred and holy place of pilgrimage one should select a place in which to perform yoga. The place must be level and not too high or low. There one should sit very comfortably, being steady and equipoised, keeping his body straight, and thus begin chanting the Vedic praëava.",

The seat should neither be too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place.\" The Hare Kåñëa mantra may be chanted by anyone, without consideration of the place or how one sits. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has openly declared, niyamitaù smaraëe na kälaù. In chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra there are no particular injunctions regarding one's sitting place. The injunction niyamitaù smaraëe na kälaù includes deça, käla and pätra—place, time and the individual. Therefore anyone may chant the Hare Kåñëa mantra, without consideration of the time and place. Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is very difficult to find a suitable place according to the recommendations of Bhagavad-gétä. The Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, however, may be chanted at any place and any time, and this will bring results very quickly. Yet even while chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra one may observe regulative principles. Thus while sitting and chanting one may keep his body straight, and this will help one in the chanting process; otherwise one may feel sleepy."
