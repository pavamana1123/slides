            "content": "A sannyäsé is one who has clearly understood, through advancement in knowledge, that Brahman—he, the person himself—is the soul, not the body. One who has this understanding may take sannyäsa, for he is situated in the \"ahaà brahmäsmi\" position. Brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä na çocati na käìkñati . Such a person, who no longer laments or hankers to maintain his body and who can accept all living entities as spirit souls, can then enter the devotional service of the Lord. If one does not enter the devotional service of the Lord but artificially considers himself Brahman or Näräyaëa, not perfectly understanding that the soul and body are different, one certainly falls down (patanty adhaù). Such a person again gives importance to the body. There are many sannyäsés in India who stress the importance of the body. Some of them give special importance to the body of the poor man, accepting him as daridra-näräyaëa, as if Näräyaëa had a material body. Many other sannyäsés stress the importance of the social position of the body as a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra. Such sannyäsés are considered the greatest rascals (asattamäù). They are shameless because they have not yet understood the difference between the body and the soul and instead have accepted the body of a brähmaëa to be a brähmaëa. Brahmanism (brähmaëya) consists of the knowledge of Brahman. But actually the body of a brähmaëa is not Brahman. Similarly, the body is neither rich nor poor. If the body of a poor man were daridra-näräyaëa, this would mean that the body of a rich man, on the contrary, must be dhané-näräyaëa. Therefore sannyäsés who do not know the meaning of Näräyaëa, those who regard the body as Brahman or as Näräyaëa, are described here as asattamäù, the most abominable rascals. Following the bodily concept of life, such sannyäsés make various programs to serve the body. They conduct farcical missions consisting of so-called religious activities meant to mislead all of human society. These sannyäsés have been described herein as apatrapaù and asattamäù—shameless and fallen from spiritual life."
