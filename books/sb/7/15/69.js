Formerly, during the previous lifetime of Lord Brahmä, Närada Muni was one of the denizens of Gandharvaloka, but unfortunately, as will be explained, he fell from his exalted position in Gandharvaloka, where the inhabitants are extremely beautiful and expert in singing, to become a çüdra. Nonetheless, because of his association with devotees, he became more fortunate than he was in Gandharvaloka. Even though cursed by the prajäpatis to become a çüdra, in his next life he became the son of Lord Brahmä."
