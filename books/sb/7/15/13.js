    "translation": "Religious principles that obstruct one from following his own religion are called vidharma. Religious principles introduced by others are called para-dharma. A new type of religion created by one who is falsely proud and who opposes the principles of the Vedas is called upadharma. And interpretation by one's jugglery of words is called chala-dharma.",

            "content": "To create a new type of dharma has become fashionable in this age. So-called svämés and yogés support that one may follow any type of religious system, according to one's own choice, because all systems are ultimately the same. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam, however, such fashionable ideas are called vidharma because they go against one's own religious system. The real religious system is described by the Supreme Personality of Godhead: sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja  the real religious system is that which leads one to become a devotee of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, anything opposed to this religious system of progressive Kåñëa consciousness is called vidharma, para-dharma, upadharma or chala-dharma. Misinterpretation of Bhagavad-gétä is chala-dharma. When Kåñëa directly says something and some rascal interprets it to mean something different, this is chala-dharma—a religious system of cheating—or çabda-bhit, a jugglery of words. One should be extremely careful to avoid these various types of cheating systems of religion."
