            "content": "The word dharmavit, meaning \"one who knows the actual purpose of religion,\" is very significant. As explained in Bhagavad-gétä , sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja: becoming Kåñëa conscious is the topmost stage in understanding of religious principles. One who reaches this stage performs the arcanä process in devotional service. Anyone, whether a gåhastha or a sannyäsé, can keep small Deities of the Lord suitably packed or, if possible, installed, and thus worship the Deities of Rädhä-Kåñëa, Sétä-Räma, Lakñmé-Näräyaëa, Lord Jagannätha or Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu by offering food prepared in ghee and then offering the sanctified prasäda to the forefathers, demigods and other living entities as a matter of routine daily work. All the centers of our Kåñëa consciousness movement have Deity worship programs very nicely going on in which food is offered to the Deity and distributed to the first-class brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas and even to the people in general. This performance of sacrifice brings complete satisfaction. The members of the Kåñëa consciousness movement engage daily in such transcendental activities. Thus in our Kåñëa consciousness movement there is no question at all of killing animals."
