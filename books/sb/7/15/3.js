    "translation": "During the period for offering oblations to the demigods, one should invite only two brähmaëas, and while offering oblations to the forefathers, one may invite three brähmaëas. Or, in either case, only one brähmaëa will suffice. Even though one is very opulent, he should not endeavor to invite more brähmaëas or make various expensive arrangements on those occasions.",

Thus He followed this principle: na me'bhaktaç catur-vedé mad-bhaktaù çva-pacaù priyaù. The Lord says, \"It is not necessary that one become very expert in Vedic knowledge before he can become My bhakta, or devotee. Even if one is born in a family of dog-eaters, he can become My devotee and be very dear to Me, in spite of having taken birth in such a family. Therefore, offerings should be given to My devotee, and whatever My devotee has offered Me should be accepted.\" Following this principle, one should invite a first-class brähmaëa or Vaiñëava—a realized soul—and feed him while observing the çräddha ceremony to offer oblations to one's forefathers."
