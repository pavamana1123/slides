    "translation": "While continuously staring at the tip of the nose, a learned yogé practices the breathing exercises through the technical means known as püraka, kumbhaka and recaka—controlling inhalation and exhalation and then stopping them both. In this way the yogé restricts his mind from material attachments and gives up all mental desires. As soon as the mind, being defeated by lusty desires, drifts toward feelings of sense gratification, the yogé should immediately bring it back and arrest it within the core of his heart.",

This is another way to practice yoga easily. The Lord says:"

Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me.\"  If one practices devotional service by always keeping Kåñëa within the core of his heart (man-manäù), he immediately becomes a first-class yogé. Furthermore, keeping Kåñëa within the mind is not a difficult task for the devotee. For an ordinary man in the bodily concept of life, the practice of yoga may be helpful, but one who immediately takes to devotional service can immediately become a perfect yogé without difficulty."
