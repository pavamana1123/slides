    "translation": "My dear Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, you Päëòavas are so very fortunate in this world that many, many great saints, who can purify all the planets of the universe, come to your house just like ordinary visitors. Furthermore, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is living confidentially with you in your house, just like your brother.",

            "content": "Here is a statement exalting a Vaiñëava. In human society, a brähmaëa is the most respected person. A brähmaëa is one who can understand Brahman, the impersonal Brahman, but hardly ever can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described by Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä as paraà brahma. A brähmaëa may be extremely fortunate in having achieved brahma jïäna, but the Päëòavas were so exalted that the Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was living in their house like an ordinary human being. The word bhüri-bhägäù indicates that the Päëòavas were in a still higher position than brahmacärés and brähmaëas. In the following verses, Närada Muni repeatedly glorifies the position of the Päëòavas."
