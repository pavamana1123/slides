    "translation": "The mind is always agitated by waves of acceptance and rejection. Therefore all the activities of the senses should be offered into the mind, which should be offered into one's words. Then one's words should be offered into the aggregate of all alphabets, which should be offered into the concise form oàkära. Oàkära should be offered into the point bindu, bindu into the vibration of sound, and that vibration into the life air. Then the living entity, who is all that remains, should be placed in Brahman, the Supreme. This is the process of sacrifice.",

The living entity is floating in the waves of material existence because of his forgetfulness. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has therefore sung in his Gétävalé: miche mäyära vaçe, yäccha bhese', khäccha häbuòubu, bhäi. \"My dear mind, under the influence of mäyä you are being carried away by the waves of rejection and acceptance. Simply take shelter of Kåñëa.\" Jéva kåñëa-däsa, ei viçväsa, karle ta' ära duùkha näi: if we simply regard the lotus feet of Kåñëa as our ultimate shelter, we shall be saved from all these waves of mäyä, which are variously exhibited as mental and sensual activities and the agitation of rejection and acceptance. Kåñëa instructs in Bhagavad-gétä :"

By the mercy of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, this is very easy."
