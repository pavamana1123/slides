    "translation": "A pretentious religious system manufactured by one who willfully neglects the prescribed duties of his order of life is called äbhäsa [a dim reflection or false similarity]. But if one performs the prescribed duties for his particular äçrama or varëa, why are they not sufficient to mitigate all material distresses?",

However, if Viñëu is not worshiped, the followers of the varëäçrama institution manufacture some concocted God. Thus it has now become fashionable for any rascal or fool to be elected God, and there are many missionaries who have concocted their own gods, giving up their relationship with the real God. In Bhagavad-gétä it is clearly said that one who worships the demigods has lost his intelligence. Nonetheless we find that even an illiterate person who has lost all intelligence is elected God, and although he has a temple, it has meat-eating sannyäsés, and many polluted activities go on there. This type of religious system, which misguides its poor followers, is strictly forbidden. Such pretentious religions should be stopped altogether."

Also, even if one is not born in a brähmaëa family but has brahminical qualifications, he must be considered a brähmaëa. By strictly following this system, one can be happy without extra endeavor. Sva-bhäva-vihito dharmaù kasya neñöaù praçäntaye. The real aim of life is to mitigate distress, and one can do this very easily by following the principles of çästra."
