    "translation": "The ten kinds of air acting within the body are compared to the spokes of the chariot's wheels, and the top and bottom of the wheel itself are called religion and irreligion. The living entity in the bodily concept of life is the owner of the chariot. The Vedic mantra praëava is the bow, the pure living entity himself is the arrow, and the target is the Supreme Being.",

They are compared here to the spokes of the chariot's wheels. The life air is the energy for all of a living being's activities, which are sometimes religious and sometimes irreligious. Thus religion and irreligion are said to be the upper and lower portions of the chariot's wheels. When the living entity decides to go back home, back to Godhead, his target is Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the conditioned state of life, one does not understand that the goal of life is the Supreme Lord. Na te viduù svärtha-gatià hi viñëuà duräçayä ye bahir-artha-mäninaù ). Then he takes the arrow of his purified life, and with the help of the bow—the transcendental chanting of praëava, or the Hare Kåñëa mantra—he throws himself toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has commented that because the words \"bow\" and \"arrow\" are used in this verse, one might argue that the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity have become enemies. However, although the Supreme Personality of Godhead may become the so-called enemy of the living being, this is His chivalrous pleasure. For example, the Lord fought with Bhéñma, and when Bhéñma pierced the Lord's body on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, this was a kind of humor or relationship, of which there are twelve. When the conditioned soul tries to reach the Lord by hurling an arrow at Him, the Lord takes pleasure, and the living entity gains the profit of going back home, back to Godhead. Another example given in this regard is that Arjuna, as a result of piercing the ädhära-ména, or the fish within the cakra, achieved the valuable gain of Draupadé. Similarly, if with the arrow of chanting the holy name of the Lord one pierces Lord Viñëu's lotus feet, by dint of performing this heroic activity of devotional service one receives the benefit of returning home, back to Godhead."
