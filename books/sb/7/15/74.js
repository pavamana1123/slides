Anyone who takes part in this movement, regardless of what he is, can gain the topmost result achieved by a perfect sannyäsé, namely brahma jïäna (spiritual knowledge). Even more important, he can advance in devotional service. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira thought that because he was a gåhastha there was no hope of his being liberated, and therefore he asked Närada Muni how he could get out of material entanglement. But Närada Muni, citing a practical example from his own life, established that by associating with devotees and chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra, any man in any condition of life can achieve the highest perfection without a doubt."
