            "content": "From the description of the beauty of Närada Muni when he was one of the denizens of Gandharvaloka, it appears that everyone on that planet is extremely beautiful and pleasing and always decorated with flowers and sandalwood. Upabarhaëa was Närada Muni's name previously. Upabarhaëa was specifically expert in decorating himself to attract the attention of women, and thus he became a playboy, as described in the next verse. To be a playboy in this life is unfortunate because too much attraction to women will lead one to fall into the association of çüdras, who can easily take advantage of mingling with women without restriction. In this present age of Kali, when people are mandäù sumanda-matayaù—very bad because of a çüdra mentality—such free mingling is prominent. Among the higher classes—brähmaëa, kñatriya and vaiçya—there is no chance for men to mingle with women freely, but in the çüdra community such mingling is open. Because there is no cultural education in this age of Kali, everyone is spiritually untrained, and everyone is therefore to be considered çüdra (açuddhäù çüdra-kalpä hi brähmaëäù kali-sambhaväù). When all the people become çüdras, certainly they are very bad (mandäù sumanda-matayaù). Thus they manufacture their own way of life, with the result that they gradually become unfortunate (manda-bhägyäù), and furthermore they are always disturbed by various circumstances."
