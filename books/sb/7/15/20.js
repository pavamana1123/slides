    "synonyms": "kämasya—of the desire for sense gratification or the urgent needs of the body; antam—end; hi—indeed; kñut-tåòbhyäm—by one who is very hungry or thirsty; krodhasya—of anger; etat—this; phala-udayät—by venting chastisement and its reaction; janaù—a person; yäti—crosses over; na—not; lobhasya—greed; jitvä—conquering; bhuktvä—enjoying; diçaù—all directions; bhuvaù—of the globe.",
    "translation": "The strong bodily desires and needs of a person disturbed by hunger and thirst are certainly satisfied when he eats. Similarly, if one becomes very angry, that anger is satisfied by chastisement and its reaction. But as for greed, even if a greedy person has conquered all the directions of the world or has enjoyed everything in the world, still he will not be satisfied.",

When strong lusty desires for sense gratification are unfulfilled, one becomes angry. This anger can be satisfied when one chastises his enemy, but when there is an increase in lobha, or greed, which is the greatest enemy caused by rajo-guëa, the mode of passion, how can one advance in Kåñëa consciousness?"
