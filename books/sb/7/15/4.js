Those who are materially opulent spend lavishly during this ceremony. Indians spend especially lavishly on three occasions—at the birth of a child, at marriage and while observing the çräddha ceremony—but the çästras prohibit the excessive expenditures involved in inviting many brähmaëas and relatives, especially during the çräddha ceremony."
