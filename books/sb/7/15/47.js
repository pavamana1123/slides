    "translation": "According to the Vedas, there are two kinds of activities-pravåtti and nivåtti. Pravåtti activities involve raising oneself from a lower to a higher condition of materialistic life, whereas nivåtti means the cessation of material desire. Through pravåtti activities one suffers from material entanglement, but by nivåtti activities one is purified and becomes fit to enjoy eternal, blissful life.",

Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self.\" Nonetheless, those who act piously have a better chance to become devotees. As Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä ). Therefore, even if one is materially inclined, one may take to the shelter of the lotus feet of Kåñëa and Balaräma, or Gaura and Nitäi, so that he will very soon be purified of all material desires (kñipraà bhavati dharmätmä çaçvac chäntià nigacchati). As soon as one is freed from inclinations toward pious and impious activities, he becomes a perfect candidate for returning home, back to Godhead."
