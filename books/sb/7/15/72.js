    "translation": "Närada Muni continued: Being invited to that festival, I also joined, and, surrounded by women, I began musically singing the glories of the demigods. Because of this, the prajäpatis, the great demigods in charge of the affairs of the universe, forcefully cursed me with these words: \"Because you have committed an offense, may you immediately become a çüdra, devoid of beauty.\"",

            "content": "As far as kértana is concerned, the çästras say, çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù:  one should chant the glories of the Supreme Lord and the holy name of the Supreme Lord. This is clearly stated. Çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù: one should chant about and glorify Lord Viñëu, not any demigod. Unfortunately, there are foolish persons who invent some process of kértana on the basis of a demigod's name. This is an offense. Kértana means glorifying the Supreme Lord, not any demigod. Sometimes people invent kälé-kértana or çiva-kértana, and even big sannyäsés in the Mäyäväda school say that one may chant any name and still get the same result. But here we find that millions and millions of years ago, when Närada Muni was a Gandharva, he neglected the order to glorify the Lord, and being mad in the association of women, he began to chant otherwise. Thus he was cursed to become a çüdra. His first offense was that he went to join the saìkértana party in the company of lusty women, and another offense was that he considered ordinary songs, like cinema songs and other such songs, to be equal to saìkértana. For this offense he was punished with becoming a çüdra."
