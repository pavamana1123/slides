    "translation": "The ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices known as agni-hotra-yajïa, darça-yajïa, pürëamäsa-yajïa, cäturmäsya-yajïa, paçu-yajïa and soma-yajïa are all symptomized by the killing of animals and the burning of many valuables, especially food grains, all for the fulfillment of material desires and the creation of anxiety. Performing such sacrifices, worshiping Vaiçvadeva, and performing the ceremony of Baliharaëa, which all supposedly constitute the goal of life, as well as constructing temples for demigods, building resting houses and gardens, digging wells for the distribution of water, establishing booths for the distribution of food, and performing activities for public welfare—these are all symptomized by attachment to material desires.",
