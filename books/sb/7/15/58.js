The impersonalist philosophy, vivarta-väda, generally cites the acceptance of a rope to be a snake as an example of this fact. According to this example, the varieties within our vision are false, just as a rope seen to be a snake is false. The Vaiñëavas say, however, that although the idea that the rope is a snake is false, the snake is not false; one has experience of a snake in reality, and therefore he knows that although the representation of the rope as a snake is false or illusory, there is a snake in reality. Similarly, this world, which is full of varieties, is not false; it is a reflection of the reality in the Vaikuëöha world, the spiritual world."

            "content": "The reflection of the sun from a mirror is nothing but light within darkness. Thus although it is not exactly sunlight, without the sunlight the reflection would be impossible. Similarly, the varieties of this world would be impossible unless there were a real prototype in the spiritual world. The Mäyävädé philosopher cannot understand this, but a real philosopher must be convinced that light is not possible at all without a background of sunlight. Thus the jugglery of words used by the Mäyävädé philosopher to prove that this material world is false may amaze inexperienced children, but a man with full knowledge knows perfectly well that there cannot be any existence without Kåñëa. Therefore a Vaiñëava insists on the platform of somehow or other accepting Kåñëa (tasmät kenäpy upäyena manaù kåñëe niveçayet )."

One can understand how Kåñëa's material and spiritual energies are working and how He is present everywhere although everything is not Him. This philosophy of acintya-bhedäbheda, inconceivable oneness and difference, is the perfect philosophy enunciated by the Vaiñëavas. Everything is an emanation from Kåñëa, but it is not that everything must therefore be worshiped. Speculative knowledge cannot give us reality as it is, but will continue to be nefariously imperfect. So-called scientists try to prove that there is no God and that everything is happening because of the laws of nature, but this is imperfect knowledge because nothing can work unless directed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is explained in Bhagavad-gétä  by the Lord Himself:"

The background of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva. Väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù . This can be understood by a mahätmä who is perfect in knowledge. Such a mahätmä is rarely seen."
