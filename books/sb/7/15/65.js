This is the interest of one's own self, one's wife, one's children, one's disciples and one's friends, relatives, countrymen and all humanity. The Kåñëa consciousness movement can give directions for management by which everyone can partake in Kåñëa conscious activities and reach the ultimate goal, which is known as svärtha-gatim. This objective of everyone's interest is Viñëu, but because people do not know this (na te viduù svärtha-gatià hi viñëum ), they are making various plans by which to fulfill so many concocted interests in life. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is trying to bring everyone to the highest interest. The process may be differently named, but if the aim is one, people should follow it to achieve the ultimate goal in life. Unfortunately, people are thinking of different interests, and blind leaders are misleading them. Everyone is trying to reach the goal of complete happiness materially; because people do not know what complete happiness is, they are materially diverted toward different interests."
