The Hare Kåñëa movement is present in every millennium of Lord Brahmä's life, and the holy name is chanted in all the higher planetary systems, including Brahmaloka and Candraloka, not to speak of Gandharvaloka and Apsaroloka. The saìkértana movement that was started in this world five hundred years ago by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is therefore not a new movement. Sometimes, because of our bad luck, this movement is stopped, but Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and His servants again start the movement for the benefit of the entire world or, indeed, the entire universe."
