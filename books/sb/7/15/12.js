One should simply follow the instructions of Kåñëa and surrender unto Him. To do this, of course, one needs very good intelligence, which may be awakened after many, many births through good association with devotees and the practice of Kåñëa consciousness. Everything but the principle of religion recommended by Kåñëa-sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja —should be given up as irreligion."
