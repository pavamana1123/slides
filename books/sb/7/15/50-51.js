    "translation": "My dear King Yudhiñöhira, when oblations of ghee and food grains like barley and sesame are offered in sacrifice, they turn into celestial smoke, which carries one to successively higher planetary systems like the kingdoms of Dhumä, Rätri, Kåñëapakña, Dakñiëam and ultimately the moon. Then, however, the performers of sacrifice descend again to earth to become herbs, creepers, vegetables and food grains. These are eaten by different living entities and turned to semen, which is injected into female bodies. Thus one takes birth again and again.",

Thus, through the Vedic principles, they achieve only flickering happiness.\" Following the pravåtti-märga, the living entity who desires to be promoted to the higher planetary systems performs sacrifices regularly, and how he goes up and comes down again is described here in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, as well as in Bhagavad-gétä. It is also said, traiguëya-viñayä vedäù: \"The Vedas deal mainly with the three modes of material nature.\" The Vedas, especially three Vedas, namely Säma, Yajur and Åk, vividly describe this process of ascending to the higher planets and returning. But Kåñëa advises Arjuna, traiguëya-viñayä vedä nistraiguëyo bhavärjuna: one has to transcend these three modes of material nature, and then one will be released from the cycle of birth and death. Otherwise, although one may be promoted to a higher planetary system such as Candraloka, one must again come down (kñéëe puëye martya-lokaà viçanti ). After one's enjoyment due to pious activities is finished, one must return to this planet in rainfall and first take birth as a plant or creeper, which is eaten by various animals, including human beings, and turned to semen. This semen is injected into the female body, and thus the living entity takes birth. Those who return to earth in this way take birth especially in higher families like those of brähmaëas."

Therefore, whether one goes to the moon by modern mechanical arrangements or by performing pious activities, one must return to earth. That is clearly stated in this verse and explained in Bhagavad-gétä. Even if one goes to the higher planetary systems (yänti deva-vratä devän  aside from the moon, even if one goes to Brahmaloka, one must return. Yaà präpya na nivartante tad dhäma paramaà mama: but if one goes back home, back to Godhead, he need not return to this material world."
