            "content": "For spiritual advancement, one should be materially satisfied, for if one is not materially satisfied, his greed for material development will result in the frustration of his spiritual advancement. There are two things that nullify all good qualities. One is poverty. Daridra-doño guëa-räçi-näçé. If one is poverty-stricken, all his good qualities become null and void. Similarly, if one becomes too greedy, his good qualifications are lost. Therefore the adjustment is that one should not be poverty-stricken, but one must try to be fully satisfied with the bare necessities of life and not be greedy. For a devotee to be satisfied with the bare necessities is therefore the best advice for spiritual advancement. Learned authorities in devotional life consequently advise that one not endeavor to increase the number of temples and maöhas. Such activities can be undertaken only by devotees experienced in propagating the Kåñëa consciousness movement. All the äcäryas in South India, especially Çré Rämänujäcärya, constructed many big temples, and in North India all the Gosvämés of Våndävana constructed large temples. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura also constructed large centers, known as Gauòéya Maöhas. Therefore temple construction is not bad, provided proper care is taken for the propagation of Kåñëa consciousness. Even if such endeavors are considered greedy, the greed is to satisfy Kåñëa, and therefore these are spiritual activities."
