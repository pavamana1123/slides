    "translation": "O King Yudhiñöhira, because of your service to the Supreme Lord, all of you Päëòavas defeated the greatest dangers posed by numerous kings and demigods. By serving the lotus feet of Kåñëa, you conquered great enemies, who were like elephants, and thus you collected ingredients for sacrifice. By His grace, may you be delivered from material involvement.",

Närada Muni encouraged Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira by saying, \"You are already on the safe side because you, along with your entire family, have become a pure devotee of Kåñëa.\" By Kåñëa's grace, the Päëòavas conquered in the Battle of Kurukñetra and were saved from many dangers posed not only by kings but sometimes even by the demigods. Thus they are a practical example of how to live in security and safety by the grace of Kåñëa. Everyone should follow the example of the Päëòavas, who showed how to be saved by the grace of Kåñëa. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is intended to teach how everyone can live peacefully in this material world and at the end of life return home, back to Godhead. In the material world there are always dangers at every step (padaà padaà yad vipadäà na teñäm ). Nonetheless, if one takes shelter of Kåñëa without hesitation and keeps under the shelter of Kåñëa, he can easily cross the ocean of nescience. Samäçritä ye pada-pallava-plavaà mahat-padaà puëya-yaço muräreù. To the devotee, this great ocean of nescience becomes like a puddle of water in the hoofprint of a cow. A pure devotee, without embarrassing himself by trying for elevation in so many ways, stays in the safest position as a servant of Kåñëa, and thus his life is eternally safe without a doubt."
