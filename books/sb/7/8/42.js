    "translation": "King Indra said: O Supreme Lord, You are our deliverer and protector. Our shares of sacrifices, which are actually Yours, have been recovered from the demon by You. Because the demoniac king Hiraëyakaçipu was most fearsome, our hearts, which are Your permanent abode, were all overtaken by him. Now, by Your presence, the gloom and darkness in our hearts have been dissipated. O Lord, for those who always engage in Your service, which is more exalted than liberation, all material opulence is insignificant. They do not even care for liberation, not to speak of the benefits of käma, artha and dharma.",

Although the demigods are attached to material enjoyment, they are devotees of the Lord who act according to the rules and regulations of the Vedic injunctions. During the reign of Hiraëyakaçipu, everyone was disturbed in the routine duties of Vedic civilization. When Hiraëyakaçipu was killed, all the demigods, who had always been disturbed by Hiraëyakaçipu, felt relief in their general way of life."

Devotees cannot perform yajïa, and thus they cannot partake of the remnants of food offered in yajïa for the worship of Lord Viñëu. The hearts of the demigods are always filled with fear of the demons, and therefore they cannot think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The engagement of the demigods is to think of the Lord always within the cores of their hearts. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä :"

Thus their hearts, which are meant to be the abode of the Supreme Lord, are practically occupied by the demons. All the demigods felt relieved when Hiraëyakaçipu was dead, for they could easily think of the Lord. They could then receive the results of sacrifices and become happy even though in the material world."
