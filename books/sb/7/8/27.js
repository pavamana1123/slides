A sinful man who acts against the laws of nature must be punished, but sometimes he is given a chance to play, exactly like Hiraëyakaçipu when he was released from the hands of Nåsiàhadeva. Hiraëyakaçipu was destined to be ultimately killed by Nåsiàhadeva, but just to see the fun, the Lord gave him a chance to slip from His hands."
