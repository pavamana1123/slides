Therefore He is addressed as païca-viàça, the twenty-fifth element. The inhabitants of the Yakña planet are supposed to be the best of all servants, but Hiraëyakaçipu engaged them as palanquin carriers. The entire universe was in trouble because of Hiraëyakaçipu, but now that Hiraëyakaçipu's body was mixing with the five material elements—earth, water, fire, air and sky—everyone felt relief. Upon Hiraëyakaçipu's death, the Yakñas were reinstated in their original service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus they felt obliged to the Lord and offered their prayers."
