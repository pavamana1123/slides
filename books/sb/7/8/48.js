O Lord, now that You have killed this great demon, we are in our normal condition. Kindly order us, Your eternal servants, what to do now.",

            "content": "In many places in Bhagavad-gétä, the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, refers to the varëäçrama-dharma of four varëas and four äçramas. He teaches people about this varëäçrama-dharma so that all of human society can live peacefully by observing the principles for the four social divisions and four spiritual divisions (varëa and äçrama) and thus make advancement in spiritual knowledge. The Manus compiled the Manu-saàhitä. The word saàhitä means Vedic knowledge, and manu indicates that this knowledge is given by Manu. The Manus are sometimes incarnations of the Supreme Lord and sometimes empowered living entities. Formerly, many long years ago, Lord Kåñëa instructed the sun-god. The Manus are generally sons of the sun-god. Therefore, while speaking to Arjuna about the importance of Bhagavad-gétä, Kåñëa said, imaà vivasvate yogaà proktavän aham avyayam vivasvän manave präha:  \"This instruction was given to Vivasvän, the sun-god, who in turn instructed his son Manu.\" Manu gave the law known as Manu-saàhitä, which is full of directions based on varëa and äçrama concerning how to live as a human being. These are very scientific ways of life, but under the rule of demons like Hiraëyakaçipu, human society breaks all these systems of law and order and gradually becomes lower and lower. Thus there is no peace in the world. The conclusion is that if we want real peace and order in the human society, we must follow the principles laid down by the Manu-saàhitä and confirmed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa."
