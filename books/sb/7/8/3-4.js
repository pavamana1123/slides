    "translation": "When Hiraëyakaçipu understood the entire situation, he was extremely angry, so much so that his body trembled. Thus he finally decided to kill his son Prahläda. Hiraëyakaçipu was by nature very cruel, and feeling insulted, he began hissing like a snake trampled upon by someone's foot. His son Prahläda was peaceful, mild and gentle, his senses were under control, and he stood before Hiraëyakaçipu with folded hands. According to Prahläda's age and behavior, he was not to be chastised. Yet with staring, crooked eyes, Hiraëyakaçipu rebuked him with the following harsh words.",

The duration of his life is diminished, and he loses the blessings of superior persons and the results of pious activities. Hiraëyakaçipu, for example, had achieved such great power in the material world that he could subdue practically all the planetary systems in the universe, including the heavenly planets (Svargaloka). Yet now, because of his mistreatment of such a Vaiñëava as Prahläda Mahäräja, all the results of his tapasya diminished. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"
