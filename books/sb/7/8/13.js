They think that there is no God and that the so-called religious feeling of devotion to God is but an opiate, a kind of illusion, like the illusions derived from LSD and opium. Hiraëyakaçipu did not believe Prahläda Mahäräja when Prahläda asserted that his Lord is present everywhere. Because Hiraëyakaçipu, as a typical demon, was convinced that there is no God and that no one could protect Prahläda, he felt encouraged to kill his son. He challenged the idea that the devotee is always protected by the Supreme Lord."
