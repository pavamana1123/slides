    "translation": "Prahläda Mahäräja said: My dear King, the source of my strength, of which you are asking, is also the source of yours. Indeed, the original source of all kinds of strength is one. He is not only your strength or mine, but the only strength for everyone. Without Him, no one can get any strength. Whether moving or not moving, superior or inferior, everyone, including Lord Brahmä, is controlled by the strength of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

            "content": "\"Know that all beautiful, glorious and mighty creations spring from but a spark of My splendor.\" This is confirmed by Prahläda Mahäräja. If one sees extraordinary strength or power anywhere, it is derived from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To give an example, there are different grades of fire, but all of them derive heat and light from the sun. Similarly, all living entities, big or small, are dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One's only duty is to surrender, for one is a servant and cannot independently attain the position of master. One can attain the position of master only by the mercy of the master, not independently. Unless one understands this philosophy, he is still a müòha; in other words, he is not very intelligent. The müòhas, the asses who do not have this intelligence, cannot surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

He was confident that Kåñëa would give him protection under all circumstances."
