    "translation": "Manifesting a full effulgence and a fearsome countenance, Lord Nåsiàha, being very angry and finding no contestant to face His power and opulence, then sat down in the assembly hall on the excellent throne of the king. Because of fear and obedience, no one could come forward to serve the Lord directly.",

            "content": "When the Lord sat on the throne of Hiraëyakaçipu, there was no one to protest; no enemy came forward on behalf of Hiraëyakaçipu to fight with the Lord. This means that His supremacy was immediately accepted by the demons. Another point is that although Hiraëyakaçipu treated the Lord as his bitterest enemy, he was the Lord's faithful servant in Vaikuëöha, and therefore the Lord had no hesitation in sitting on the throne that Hiraëyakaçipu had so laboriously created. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura remarks in this connection that sometimes, with great care and attention, great saintly persons and åñis offer the Lord valuable seats dedicated with Vedic mantras and tantras, but still the Lord does not sit upon those thrones. Hiraëyakaçipu, however, had formerly been Jaya, the doorkeeper at the Vaikuëöha gate, and although he had fallen because of the curse of the brähmaëas and had gotten the nature of a demon, and although he had never offered anything to the Lord as Hiraëyakaçipu, the Lord is so affectionate to His devotee and servant that He nonetheless took pleasure in sitting on the throne that Hiraëyakaçipu had created. In this regard it is to be understood that a devotee is fortunate in any condition of his life."
