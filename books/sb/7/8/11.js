    "translation": "Hiraëyakaçipu replied: You rascal, you are trying to minimize my value, as if you were better than me at controlling the senses. This is over-intelligent. I can therefore understand that you desire to die at my hands, for this kind of nonsensical talk is indulged in by those about to die.",

If good instructions are given to a foolish person, he does not take advantage of them, but becomes more and more angry. Prahläda Mahäräja's authorized instructions to his father were not accepted by Hiraëyakaçipu as truth; instead Hiraëyakaçipu became increasingly angry at his great son, who was a pure devotee. This kind of difficulty always exists when a devotee preaches Kåñëa consciousness to persons like Hiraëyakaçipu, who are interested in money and women. (The word hiraëya means \"gold,\" and kaçipu refers to cushions or good bedding.) Moreover, a father does not like to be instructed by his son, especially if the father is a demon. Prahläda Mahäräja's Vaiñëava preaching to his demoniac father was indirectly effective, for because of Hiraëyakaçipu's excessive jealousy of Kåñëa and His devotee, he was inviting Nåsiàhadeva to kill him very quickly. Thus he was expediting his being killed by the Lord Himself. Although Hiraëyakaçipu was a demon, he is described here by the added word çré. Why? The answer is that fortunately he had such a great devotee son as Prahläda Mahäräja. Thus although he was a demon, he would attain salvation and return home, back to Godhead."
