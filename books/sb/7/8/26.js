    "translation": "O Yudhiñöhira, O great son of Bhärata, when Lord Nåsiàhadeva gave Hiraëyakaçipu a chance to slip from His hand, just as Garuòa sometimes plays with a snake and lets it slip from his mouth, the demigods, who had lost their abodes and who were hiding behind the clouds for fear of the demon, did not consider that incident very good. Indeed, they were perturbed.",

This incident was not very much appreciated by the demigods, for they were greatly afraid of Hiraëyakaçipu. They knew that if somehow or other Hiraëyakaçipu escaped from Nåsiàhadeva's hands and saw that the demigods were looking forward to his death with great pleasure, he would take great revenge upon them. Therefore they were very much afraid."
