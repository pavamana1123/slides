The tumultuous thundering sound was proof of the Lord's presence. The demons like Hiraëyakaçipu could now realize the supreme ruling power of the Lord, and thus Hiraëyakaçipu became afraid. However powerful a man may be, he always fears the sound of a thunderbolt. Similarly, Hiraëyakaçipu and all the demons who were his associates were extremely afraid because of the presence of the Supreme Lord in the form of sound, although they could not trace out the source of the sound."
