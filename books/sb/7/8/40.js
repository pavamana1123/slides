    "translation": "Lord Brahmä prayed: My Lord, You are unlimited, and You possess unending potencies. No one can estimate or calculate Your prowess and wonderful influence, for Your actions are never polluted by the material energy. Through the material qualities, You very easily create the universe, maintain it and again annihilate it, yet You remain the same, without deterioration. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",

            "content": "The activities of the Lord are always wonderful. His personal servants Jaya and Vijaya were confidential friends, yet they were cursed, and they accepted bodies of demons. Again, in the family of one such demon, Prahläda Mahäräja was caused to take birth to exhibit the behavior of an exalted devotee, and then the Lord accepted the body of Nåsiàhadeva to kill that same demon, who by the Lord's own will had taken birth in a demoniac family. Therefore, who can understand the Lord's transcendental activities? Not to speak of understanding the transcendental activities of the Lord, no one can understand even the activities of His servants. In Caitanya-caritämåta  it is said, täìra väkya, kriyä, mudrä vijïeha nä bhujhaya: no one can understand the activities of the Lord's servants. Therefore, what to speak of the activities of the Lord? Who can understand how Kåñëa is benefiting the entire world? The Lord is addressed as duranta-çakti because no one can understand His potencies and how He acts."
