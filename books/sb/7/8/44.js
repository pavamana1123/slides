    "translation": "The inhabitants of Pitåloka prayed: Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Lord Nåsiàhadeva, the maintainer of the religious principles of the universe. He has killed Hiraëyakaçipu, the demon who by force enjoyed all the offerings of the çräddha ceremonies performed by our sons and grandsons on the anniversaries of our death and who drank the water with sesame seeds offered in holy places of pilgrimage. By killing this demon, O Lord, You have taken back all this stolen property from his abdomen by piercing it with Your nails. We therefore wish to offer our respectful obeisances unto You.",

Thus when there is a demoniac rule, everything concerning the Vedic principles is turned upside down, all the religious ceremonies of yajïa are stopped, the resources meant to be spent for yajïa are taken away by the demoniac government, everything becomes chaotic, and consequently the entire world becomes hell itself. When the demons are killed by the presence of Nåsiàhadeva, everyone feels comfortable, irrespective of the planet upon which he lives."
