If a devotee is qualified, sincere and serious about Kåñëa consciousness and if he follows the instructions of a bona fide spiritual master, as Prahläda Mahäräja did when preaching the instructions he had received from Närada Muni, his preaching is effective. As it is said in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

Thus if one is inspired to take to Kåñëa consciousness and if one practices the process in his life, he is surely successful in returning home, back to Godhead. By the grace of Prahläda Mahäräja, all his class friends, the sons of the demons, became Vaiñëavas. They did not like hearing from their so-called teachers Ñaëòa and Amarka, who were interested only in teaching them about diplomacy, politics, economic development and similar topics meant exclusively for sense gratification."
