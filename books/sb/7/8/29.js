    "translation": "As a snake captures a mouse or Garuòa captures a very venomous snake, Lord Nåsiàhadeva captured Hiraëyakaçipu, who could not be pierced even by the thunderbolt of King Indra. As Hiraëyakaçipu moved his limbs here, there and all around, very much afflicted at being captured, Lord Nåsiàhadeva placed the demon on His lap, supporting him with His thighs, and in the doorway of the assembly hall the Lord very easily tore the demon to pieces with the nails of His hand.",

Therefore, to keep the promise of Lord Brahmä intact, Nåsiàhadeva placed Hiraëyakaçipu's body on His lap, which was neither land nor sky. Hiraëyakaçipu had received the benediction that he would not die either during the day or at night. Therefore, to keep this promise of Brahmä, the Lord killed Hiraëyakaçipu in the evening, which is the end of day and the beginning of night but is neither day nor night. Hiraëyakaçipu had taken a benediction from Lord Brahmä that he would not die from any weapon or be killed by any person, dead or alive. Therefore, just to keep the word of Lord Brahmä, Lord Nåsiàhadeva pierced Hiraëyakaçipu's body with His nails, which were not weapons and were neither living nor dead. Indeed, the nails can be called dead, but at the same time they can be said to be alive. To keep intact all of Lord Brahmä's benedictions, Lord Nåsiàhadeva paradoxically but very easily killed the great demon Hiraëyakaçipu."
