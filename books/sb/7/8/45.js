    "translation": "The inhabitants of Siddhaloka prayed: O Lord Nåsiàhadeva, because we belong to Siddhaloka, we automatically achieve perfection in all eight kinds of mystic power. Yet Hiraëyakaçipu was so dishonest that by the strength of his power and austerity, he took away our powers. Thus he became very proud of his mystic strength. Now, because this rogue has been killed by Your nails, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You.",

They can fly from one planet to another without airplanes. This is called laghimä-siddhi. They can actually become very light and fly in the sky. By a severe type of austerity, however, Hiraëyakaçipu excelled all the inhabitants of Siddhaloka and created disturbances for them. The residents of Siddhaloka were also beaten by the powers of Hiraëyakaçipu. Now that Hiraëyakaçipu had been killed by the Lord, the inhabitants of Siddhaloka also felt relieved."
