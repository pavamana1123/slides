A devotee never claims to be very powerful himself; instead, he fully surrenders to the lotus feet of Kåñëa, being confident that in all dangerous conditions Kåñëa will protect His devotee. Kåñëa Himself says in Bhagavad-gétä , kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati: \"O son of Kunté, declare boldly that My devotee never perishes.\" The Lord requested Arjuna to declare this instead of declaring it Himself because sometimes Kåñëa changes His view and therefore people might not believe Him. Thus Kåñëa asked Arjuna to declare that a devotee of the Lord is never vanquished."

A devotee cannot execute the order of anyone except the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the position of a devotee. Hiraëyakaçipu could understand that this boy must have been very powerful, since the boy did not heed his orders. Hiraëyakaçipu asked his son, kià balaù: \"How have you overcome my order? By whose strength have you done this?\""
