O Lord, we can understand that Hiraëyakaçipu was the same Jaya who engaged in Your service but was cursed by brähmaëas and who thus received the body of a demon. We understand that his having now been killed is Your special mercy upon him.",

Jaya and Vijaya were cursed by the brähmaëas Sanaka, Sanat-kumära, Sanandana and Sanätana because Jaya and Vijaya checked these four Kumäras. The Lord accepted this cursing of His servants and agreed that they would have to go to the material world and would then return to Vaikuëöha after serving the term of the curse. Jaya and Vijaya were very much perturbed, but the Lord advised them to act as enemies, for then they would return after three births; otherwise, ordinarily, they would have to take seven births. With this authority, Jaya and Vijaya acted as the Lord's enemies, and now that these two were dead, all the Viñëudütas understood that the Lord's killing of Hiraëyakaçipu was special mercy bestowed upon them."
