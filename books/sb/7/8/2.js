    "translation": "When Ñaëòa and Amarka, the sons of Çukräcärya, observed that all the students, the sons of the demons, were becoming advanced in Kåñëa consciousness because of the association of Prahläda Mahäräja, they were afraid. They approached the King of the demons and described the situation as it was.",

            "content": "The words buddhim ekänta-saàsthitäm indicate that as an effect of Prahläda Mahäräja's preaching, the students who listened to him became fixed in the conclusion that Kåñëa consciousness is the only object of human life. The fact is that anyone who associates with a pure devotee and follows his instructions becomes fixed in Kåñëa consciousness and is not disturbed by materialistic consciousness. The teachers particularly observed this in their students, and therefore they were afraid because the whole community of students was gradually becoming Kåñëa conscious."
