    "translation": "To prove that the statement of His servant Prahläda Mahäräja was substantial—in other words, to prove that the Supreme Lord is present everywhere, even within the pillar of an assembly hall—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, exhibited a wonderful form never before seen. The form was neither that of a man nor that of a lion. Thus the Lord appeared in His wonderful form in the assembly hall.",

Is He present in this pillar?\" Prahläda Mahäräja fearlessly replied, \"Yes, my Lord is present everywhere.\" Therefore, to convince Hiraëyakaçipu that the statement of Prahläda Mahäräja was unmistakably true, the Lord appeared from the pillar. The Lord appeared as half lion and half man so that Hiraëyakaçipu could not understand whether the great giant was a lion or a human being. To substantiate Prahläda's statement, the Lord proved that His devotee, as declared in Bhagavad-gétä, is never vanquished (kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati ). Prahläda Mahäräja's demoniac father had repeatedly threatened to kill Prahläda, but Prahläda was confident that he could not be killed, since he was protected by the Supreme Lord. By appearing from the pillar, the Lord encouraged His devotee, saying in effect, \"Don't worry. I am present here.\" By manifesting His form as Nåsiàhadeva, the Lord also preserved the truth of Lord Brahmä's promise that Hiraëyakaçipu was not to be killed by any animal or any man. The Lord appeared in a form that could not be said to be fully a man or a lion."
