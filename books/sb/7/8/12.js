But what the demon does not know is stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä : nähaà prakäçaù sarvasya yogamäyä-samävåtaù. \"I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by yogamäyä.\" The Lord is open to being seen by devotees, but nondevotees cannot see Him. The qualification for seeing God is stated in Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38): premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti. A devotee who has developed a genuine love for Kåñëa can always see Him everywhere, whereas a demon, not having a clear understanding of the Supreme Lord, cannot see Him. When Hiraëyakaçipu was threatening to kill Prahläda Mahäräja, Prahläda certainly saw the column standing before him and his father, and he saw that the Lord was present in the pillar to encourage him not to fear his demoniac father's words. The Lord was present to protect him. Hiraëyakaçipu marked Prahläda's observation and asked him, \"Where is your God?\" Prahläda Mahäräja replied, \"He is everywhere.\" Then Hiraëyakaçipu asked, \"Why is He not in this pillar before me?\" Thus in all circumstances the devotee can always see the Supreme Lord, whereas the nondevotee cannot."

Prahläda Mahäräja, his legitimate son, was to have inherited this vast property, but because of his impudence, he was going to die at his father's hands. Therefore the demoniac father considered Prahläda the most unfortunate because Prahläda would not be able to inherit his property. Hiraëyakaçipu did not know that Prahläda Mahäräja was the most fortunate person within the three worlds because Prahläda was protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such are the misunderstandings of demons. They do not know that a devotee is protected by the Lord in all circumstances (kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati )."
