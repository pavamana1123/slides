    "translation": "Lord Çiva said: The end of the millennium is the time for Your anger. Now that this insignificant demon Hiraëyakaçipu has been killed, O my Lord, who are naturally affectionate to Your devotee, kindly protect his son Prahläda Mahäräja, who is standing nearby as Your fully surrendered devotee.",

            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the creator of the material world. There are three processes in creation—namely creation, maintenance and finally annihilation. During the period of annihilation, at the end of each millennium, the Lord becomes angry, and the part of anger is played by Lord Çiva, who is therefore called Rudra. When the Lord appeared in great anger to kill Hiraëyakaçipu, everyone was extremely afraid of the Lord's attitude, but Lord Çiva, knowing very well that the Lord's anger is also His lélä, was not afraid. Lord Çiva knew that he would have to play the part of anger for the Lord. Käla means Lord Çiva (Bhairava), and kopa refers to the Lord's anger. These words, combined together as kopa-käla, refer to the end of each millennium. Actually the Lord is always affectionate toward His devotees, even though He may appear very angry. Because He is avyayätmä-because He never falls down—even when angry the Lord is affectionate toward His devotees. Therefore Lord Çiva reminded the Lord to act like an affectionate father toward Prahläda Mahäräja, who was standing by the Lord's side as an exalted, fully surrendered devotee."
