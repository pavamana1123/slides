Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, however, has derived a meaning from this word durvinéta by the mercy of the goddess of learning, Sarasvaté. He says that duù refers to this material world. This is confirmed by Lord Kåñëa in His instruction in Bhagavad-gétä that this material world is duùkhälayam, full of material conditions. Vi means viçeña, \"specifically,\" and néta means \"brought in.\" By the mercy of the Supreme Lord, Prahläda Mahäräja was especially brought to this material world to teach people how to get out of the material condition. Lord Kåñëa says, yadä yadä hi dharmasya glänir bhavati bhärata . When the entire population, or part of it, becomes forgetful of its own duty, Kåñëa comes. When Kåñëa is not present the devotee is present, but the mission is the same: to free the poor conditioned souls from the clutches of the mäyä that chastises them."

            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura further explains that the word mandätman means manda—very bad or very slow in spiritual realization. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam , mandäù sumanda-matayo manda-bhägyä. Prahläda Mahäräja is the guide of all the mandas, or bad living entities who are under the influence of mäyä. He is the benefactor even of the slow and bad living entities in this material world. Kula-bheda-karädhama: by his actions, Prahläda Mahäräja made great personalities who established big, big families seem insignificant. Everyone is interested in his own family and in making his dynasty famous, but Prahläda Mahäräja was so liberal that he made no distinction between one living entity and another. Therefore he was greater than the great prajäpatis who established their dynasties. The word stabdham means obstinate. A devotee does not care for the instructions of the asuras. When they give instructions, he remains silent. A devotee cares about the instructions of Kåñëa, not those of demons or nondevotees. He does not give any respect to a demon, even though the demon be his father. Mac-chäsanodvåttam: Prahläda Mahäräja was disobedient to the orders of his demoniac father. Yama-kñayam: every conditioned soul is under the control of Yamaräja, but Hiraëyakaçipu said that he considered Prahläda Mahäräja his deliverer, for Prahläda would stop Hiraëyakaçipu's repetition of birth and death. Because Prahläda Mahäräja, being a great devotee, was better than any yogé, Hiraëyakaçipu was to be brought among the society of bhakti-yogés. Thus Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has explained these words in a very interesting way as they can be interpreted from the side of Sarasvaté, the mother of learning."
