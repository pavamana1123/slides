    "translation": "While Hiraëyakaçipu looked all around to find the source of the sound, that wonderful form of the Lord, which could not be ascertained to be either a man or a lion, emerged from the pillar.

Müòhas, rascals, think that Kåñëa is an ordinary human being who appears for the benefit of other human beings. paraà bhävam ajänantaù: fools, rascals and demons cannot realize the supreme potency of the Lord, but He can do anything and everything; indeed, He can do whatever He likes. When Hiraëyakaçipu received benedictions from Lord Brahmä, he thought that he was safe, since he received the benediction that he would not be killed either by an animal or by a human being. He never thought that an animal and human being would be combined so that demons like him would be puzzled by such a form. This is the meaning of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's omnipotence."
