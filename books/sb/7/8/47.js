All the inhabitants of Nägaloka, which is situated below the earthly planetary system, were in great anxiety because their wealth had been stolen and their wives kidnapped by Hiraëyakaçipu. Now, Hiraëyakaçipu having been killed, their wealth and wives were returned, and their wives felt satisfied. The inhabitants of various lokas, or planets, offered their respectful obeisances unto the Lord because they were relieved by the death of Hiraëyakaçipu. Disturbances similar to those created by Hiraëyakaçipu are now taking place all over the world because of demoniac governments. As stated in the Twelfth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the men of the governments of Kali-yuga will be no better than rogues and plunderers. Thus the populace will be harassed on one side by scarcity of food and on another by heavy taxation by the government. In other words, the people in most parts of the world in this age are harassed by the ruling principles of Hiraëyakaçipu."
