    "translation": "My dear King Yudhiñöhira, the demigods then approached the Lord. They were headed by Lord Brahmä, King Indra and Lord Çiva and included great saintly persons and the residents of Pitåloka, Siddhaloka, Vidyädhara-loka and the planet of the snakes. The Manus approached, and so did the chiefs of various other planets. The angelic dancers approached, as did the Gandharvas, the Cäraëas, the Yakñas, the inhabitants of Kinnaraloka, the Vetälas, the inhabitants of Kimpuruña-loka, and the personal servants of Viñëu like Sunanda and Kumuda. All of them came near the Lord, who glowed with intense light. They individually offered their obeisances and prayers, their hands folded at their heads.",
