When this attachment became pronounced, their teachers, Ñaëòa and Amarka, were very much afraid that the boys would become more and more devoted to the Lord. In a helpless condition, they approached Hiraëyakaçipu and described in detail the effect of Prahläda's preaching. After hearing of this, Hiraëyakaçipu decided to kill his son Prahläda. Hiraëyakaçipu was so angry that Prahläda Mahäräja fell down at his feet and said many things just to pacify him, but he was unsuccessful in satisfying his demoniac father. Hiraëyakaçipu, as a typical demon, began to advertise himself as being greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Prahläda Mahäräja challenged him, saying that Hiraëyakaçipu was not God, and began to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead, declaring that the Lord is all-pervading, that everything is under Him, and that no one is equal to or greater than Him. Thus he requested his father to be submissive to the omnipotent Supreme Lord."

Hiraëyakaçipu asked his Vaiñëava son whether his God existed within the columns of the palace, and Prahläda Mahäräja immediately accepted that since the Lord is present everywhere, He was also present within the columns. When Hiraëyakaçipu heard this philosophy from his young son, he derided the boy's statement as just the talk of a child and forcefully struck the pillar with his fist."

            "content": "As soon as Hiraëyakaçipu struck the column, there issued forth a tumultuous sound. At first Hiraëyakaçipu, the King of the demons, could not see anything but the pillar, but to substantiate Prahläda's statements, the Lord came out of the pillar in His wonderful incarnation as Narasiàha, half lion and half man. Hiraëyakaçipu could immediately understand that the extraordinarily wonderful form of the Lord was surely meant for his death, and thus he prepared to fight with the form of half lion and half man. The Lord performed His pastimes by fighting with the demon for some time, and in the evening, on the border between day and night, the Lord captured the demon, threw him on His lap, and killed him by piercing his abdomen with His nails. The Lord not only killed Hiraëyakaçipu, the King of the demons, but also killed many of his followers. When there was no one else to fight, the Lord, roaring with anger, sat down on Hiraëyakaçipu's throne."

            "content": "The entire universe was thus relieved of the rule of Hiraëyakaçipu, and everyone was jubilant in transcendental bliss. Then all the demigods, headed by Lord Brahmä, approached the Lord. These included the great saintly persons, the Pitäs, the Siddhas, the Vidyädharas, the Nägas, the Manus, the prajäpatis, the Gandharvas, the Cäraëas, the Yakñas, the Kimpuruñas, the Vaitälikas, the Kinnaras and also many other varieties of beings in human form. All of them stood not far from the Supreme Personality of Godhead and began offering their prayers unto the Lord, whose spiritual effulgence was brilliant as He sat on the throne."
