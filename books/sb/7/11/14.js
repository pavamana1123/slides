A king or kñatriya is not allowed to levy taxes on brähmaëas, but he may make his livelihood by levying minimal taxes, customs duties, and penalty fines upon his other subjects.",

Brähmaëas have six occupational duties, of which three are compulsory—namely, studying the Vedas, worshiping the Deity and giving charity. By teaching, by inducing others to worship the Deity, and by accepting gifts, the brähmaëas receive the necessities of life. This is also confirmed in the Manu-saàhitä:"

            "content": "Of the six occupational duties of the brähmaëas, three are compulsory—namely, worship of the Deity, study of the Vedas and the giving of charity. In exchange, a brähmaëa should receive charity, and this should be his means of livelihood. A brähmaëa cannot take up any professional occupational duty for his livelihood. The çästras especially stress that if one claims to be a brähmaëa, he cannot engage in the service of anyone else; otherwise he at once falls from his position and becomes a çüdra. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé and Sanätana Gosvämé belonged to a very respectful family, but because they engaged in the service of Nawab Hussain Shah—not even as ordinary clerks, but as ministers—they were ostracized from brahminical society. Indeed, they became like Mohammedans and even changed their names. Unless a brähmaëa is very pure, he cannot accept charity from others. Charity should be given to those who are pure. Even if one is born in a family of brähmaëas, if one acts as a çüdra one cannot accept charity, for this is strictly prohibited. Although the kñatriyas are almost as qualified as the brähmaëas, even they cannot accept charity. This is strictly prohibited in this verse by the word apratigraha. What to speak of the lower social orders, even the kñatriyas must not accept charity. The king or government may levy taxes upon the citizens in various ways—by revenue duties, customs duties, realization of fines, and so on—provided the king is able to give full protection to his subjects to assure the security of their life and property. Unless he is able to give protection, he cannot levy taxes. However, a king must not levy any tax upon the brähmaëas and the Vaiñëavas fully engaged in Kåñëa consciousness."
