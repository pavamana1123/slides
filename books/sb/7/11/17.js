            "content": "The occupational duty of a brähmaëa should not be accepted by persons in lower social orders, especially vaiçyas and çüdras. For example, an occupational duty of the brähmaëa is to teach Vedic knowledge, but unless there is an emergency, this professional duty should not be accepted by the kñatriyas, vaiçyas or çüdras. Even a kñatriya cannot accept the duties of a brähmaëa unless there is an emergency, and then even if he does so he should not accept charity from anyone else. Sometimes brähmaëas protest against our Kåñëa consciousness movement for creating brähmaëas from Europeans, or, in other words, from mlecchas and yavanas. This movement, however, is here supported in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. At the present moment, society is in a chaotic condition, and everyone has given up the cultivation of spiritual life, which is especially meant for the brähmaëas. Because spiritual culture has been stopped all over the world, there is now an emergency, and therefore it is now time to train those who are considered lower and condemned, so that they may become brähmaëas and take up the work of spiritual progress. The spiritual progress of human society has been stopped, and this should be considered an emergency. Here is solid support from Närada Muni of the movement known as Kåñëa consciousness."
