            "content": "Herein it is clearly stated by Närada Muni that one should not be accepted as a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra according to birth, for although this is going on now, it is not accepted by the çästras. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù. Thus the four divisions of society—brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra—are to be ascertained according to qualities and activities. If one was born in a brähmaëa family and has acquired the brahminical qualifications, he is to be accepted as a brähmaëa; otherwise, he should be considered a brahma-bandhu. Similarly, if a çüdra acquires the qualities of a brähmaëa, although he was born in a çüdra family, he is not a çüdra; because he has developed the qualities of a brähmaëa, he should be accepted as a brähmaëa. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is meant to develop these brahminical qualities. Regardless of the community in which one was born, if one develops the qualities of a brähmaëa he should be accepted as a brähmaëa, and he then may be offered the order of sannyäsa. Unless one is qualified in terms of the brahminical symptoms, one cannot take sannyäsa. In designating a person a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra, birth is not the essential symptom. This understanding is very important. Herein Närada Muni distinctly says that one may be accepted according to the caste of his birth if he has the corresponding qualifications, but otherwise he should not. One who has attained the qualifications of a brähmaëa, regardless of where he was born, should be accepted as a brähmaëa. Similarly, if one has developed the qualities of a çüdra or a caëòäla, regardless of where he was born, he should be accepted in terms of those symptoms."
