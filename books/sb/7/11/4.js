    "translation": "No one is superior to you in peaceful life and mercy, and no one knows better than you how to execute devotional service or how to become the best of the brähmaëas. Therefore, you know all the principles of confidential religious life, and no one knows them better than you.",

Actually, it is for this purpose that Närada Muni compiled his Bhakti-sütra and gave directions in the Närada-païcarätra. To learn about religious principles and the perfection of life, one must take instruction from the disciplic succession of Närada Muni. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is directly in the line of the Brahma-sampradäya. Närada Muni received instructions from Lord Brahmä and in turn transmitted the instructions to Vyäsadeva. Vyäsadeva instructed his son Çukadeva Gosvämé, who spoke Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is based on Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä. Because Çrémad-Bhägavatam was spoken by Çukadeva Gosvämé and Bhagavad-gétä was spoken by Kåñëa, there is no difference between them. If we strictly follow the principle of disciplic succession, we are certainly on the right path of spiritual liberation, or eternal engagement in devotional service."
