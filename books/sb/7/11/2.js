            "content": "Sanätana-dharma means devotional service. The word sanätana refers to that which is eternal, which does not change but continues in all circumstances. We have several times explained what the eternal occupational duty of the living being is. Indeed, it has been explained by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Jévera 'svarüpa' haya-kåñëera 'nitya-däsa':  the real occupational duty of the living entity is to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even if one prefers to deviate from this principle he remains a servant because that is his eternal position; but one serves mäyä, the illusory, material energy. The Kåñëa consciousness movement, therefore, is an attempt to guide human society to serving the Personality of Godhead instead of serving the material world with no real profit. Our actual experience is that every man, animal, bird and beast—indeed, every living entity—is engaged in rendering service. Even though one's body or one's superficial religion may change, every living entity is always engaged in the service of someone. Therefore, the mentality of service is called the eternal occupational duty. This eternal occupational duty can be organized through the institution of varëäçrama, in which there are four varëas (brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra) and four äçramas (brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa). Thus, Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja inquired from Närada Muni about the principles of sanätana-dharma for the benefit of human society."
