            "content": "It is very important for peaceful householder life that a woman follow the vow of her husband. Any disagreement with the husband's vow will disrupt family life. In this regard, Cäëakya Paëòita gives a very valuable instruction: dampatyoù kalaho nästi tatra çréù svayam ägatäù. When there are no fights between husband and wife, the goddess of fortune automatically comes to the home. A woman's education should be conducted along the lines indicated in this verse. The basic principle for a chaste woman is to be always favorably disposed toward her husband. In Bhagavad-gétä  it is said, stréñu duñöäsu värñëeya jäyate varëa-saìkaraù: if the women are polluted, there will be varëa-saìkara population. In modern terms, the varëa-saìkara are the hippies, who do not follow any regulative injunctions. Another explanation is that when the population is varëa-saìkara, no one can know who is on what platform. The varëäçrama system scientifically divides society into four varëas and four äçramas, but in varëa-saìkara society there are no such distinctions, and no one can know who is who. In such a society, no one can distinguish between a brähmaëa, a kñatriya, a vaiçya and a çüdra. For peace and happiness in the material world, the varëäçrama institution must be introduced. The symptoms of one's activities must be defined, and one must be educated accordingly. Then spiritual advancement will automatically be possible."
