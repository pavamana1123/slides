    "translation": "Offering obeisances to the higher sections of society [the brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas], being always very clean, being free from duplicity, serving one's master, performing sacrifices without uttering mantras, not stealing, always speaking the truth and giving all protection to the cows and brähmaëas—these are the symptoms of the çüdra.",

Here it is recommended that a first-class çüdra must remain very clean, must not steal or speak lies, and must always render service to his master. A çüdra may attend sacrifices and Vedic ritualistic ceremonies along with his master, but he should not utter the mantras, for these may be uttered only by the members of the higher sections of society. Unless one is completely pure and has been raised to the standard of a brähmaëa, kñatriya or vaiçya—in other words, unless one is dvija, twice-born—the chanting of mantras will not be fruitful."
