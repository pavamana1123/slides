In the Vaikuëöha planets, Lord Viñëu is worshiped by many, many thousands of goddesses of fortune, and in Goloka Våndävana, Lord Kåñëa is worshiped by many, many thousands of gopés, all of whom are goddesses of fortune. A woman should serve her husband as faithfully as the goddess of fortune. A man should be an ideal servant of the Lord, and a woman should be an ideal wife like the goddess of fortune. Then both husband and wife will be so faithful and strong that by acting together they will return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt. In this regard, Çréla Madhväcärya gives this opinion:"

Similarly, a disciple should think of the spiritual master as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a çüdra should think of a brähmaëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and a servant should think of his master as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this way, all of them will automatically become devotees of the Lord. In other words, by thinking this way, all of them will become Kåñëa conscious."
