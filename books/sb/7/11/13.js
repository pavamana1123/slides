    "translation": "Those who have been reformed by the garbhädhäna ceremony and other prescribed reformatory methods, performed with Vedic mantras and without interruption, and who have been approved by Lord Brahmä, are dvijas, or twice-born. Such brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas, purified by their family traditions and by their behavior, should worship the Lord, study the Vedas and give charity. In this system, they should follow the principles of the four äçramas [brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa].",

            "content": "After giving a general list of thirty qualifications for one's behavior, Närada Muni now describes the principles of the four varëas and four äçramas. A human being must be trained in the above-mentioned thirty qualities; otherwise, he is not even a human being. Then, among such qualified persons, the varëäçrama process should be introduced. In the varëäçrama system, the first ceremony for purification is garbhädhäna, which is performed with mantras at the time of sex for propagating a good child. One who uses sex life not for sensual pleasures but only to beget children according to the reformatory method is also accepted as a brahmacäré. One should not waste semen on sensual pleasure, violating the principles of Vedic life. Restraint in sex is possible, however, only when the populace is trained in the above-mentioned thirty qualities; otherwise, it is not possible. Even if one is born in a family of dvijas, or twice-born, if they have not followed the reformatory process he is called a dvija-bandhu—not one of the twice-born, but a friend of the twice-born. The whole purpose of this system is to create good population. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, when women are polluted the populace is varëa-saìkara, and when the varëa-saìkara population increases, the situation of the entire world becomes hellish. Therefore, all the Vedic literatures strongly warn against creating varëa-saìkara population. When there is varëa-saìkara population, the people cannot be properly controlled for peace and prosperity, regardless of great legislative assemblies, parliaments and similar bodies."
