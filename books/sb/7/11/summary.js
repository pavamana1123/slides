Now he inquired from Närada Muni about the actual religion of a human being and about special characteristics of varëäçrama-dharma, which marks the highest status of human civilization. When Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira asked Närada Muni about these matters, Närada Muni stopped giving his own statements and quoted statements by Lord Näräyaëa, for He is the supreme authority for giving religious codes (dharmaà tu säkñäd bhagavat-praëétam ). Every human being is expected to acquire thirty qualities, such as truthfulness, mercy and austerity. The process of following the priniples of religion is known as sanätana-dharma, the eternal religious system."

            "content": "The varëäçrama system delineates the divisions of brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra. It also sets forth the system of saàskäras. The garbhädhäna saàskära, the ceremony for begetting a child, must be observed by the higher section of people, namely the dvijas. One who follows the garbhädhäna saàskära system is actually twice-born, but those who do not, who deviate from the principles of varëäçrama-dharma, are called dvija-bandhus. The principal occupations for a brähmaëa are worshiping the Deity, teaching others how to worship the Deity, studying the Vedic literatures, teaching the Vedic literatures, accepting charity from others and again giving charity to others. A brähmaëa should make his livelihood from these six occupational duties. The duty of a kñatriya is to give protection to the citizens and levy taxes upon them, but he is forbidden to tax the brähmaëas. The members of the Kåñëa consciousness movement should therefore be exempt from government taxation. Kñatriyas may tax everyone but the brähmaëas. Vaiçyas should cultivate the land, produce food grains and protect the cows, whereas the çüdras, who by quality never become brähmaëas, kñatriyas or vaiçyas, should serve the three higher classes and be satisfied. Other means of livelihood are also prescribed for the brähmaëas, and these are four-çäléna, yäyävara, çila, and uïchana. Each of these occupational duties is successively better."

In times of emergency, all the classes but the kñatriyas may accept professional duties of others. The means of livelihood known as åta (çiloïchana), amåta (ayäcita), måta (yäcïä), pramåta (karñaëa), and satyänåta (väëijya) may be accepted by everyone but the kñatriyas. For a brähmaëa or a kñatriya, engaging in the service of the vaiçyas or çüdras is considered the profession of dogs."

            "content": "Närada Muni also described that the symptom of a brähmaëa is controlled senses, the symptoms of a kñatriya are power and fame, the symptom of a vaiçya is service to the brähmaëas and kñatriyas, and the symptom of a çüdra is service to the three higher classes. The qualification for a woman is to be a very faithful and chaste wife. In this way, Närada Muni described the characteristics of higher and lower grades of people and recommended that one follow the principles of his caste or his hereditary occupation. One cannot suddenly give up a profession to which he is accustomed, and therefore it is recommended that one gradually be awakened. The symptoms of brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas, and çüdras are very important, and therefore one should be designated only by these symptoms, and not by birth. Designation by birth is strictly forbidden by Närada Muni and all great personalities."
