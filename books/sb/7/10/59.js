            "content": "\"Of all yogés, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\" The actual purpose of mystic yoga is to concentrate one's attention fully on the Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and always think of Him (mad-gatenäntarätmanä). To attain such perfection, one must undergo a certain process—haöha-yoga—and through this yoga system the practitioner achieves some uncommon mystic power. The asuras, however, instead of becoming devotees of Kåñëa, utilize this mystic power for their personal sense gratification. Maya Dänava, for example, is mentioned here as mahä-yogé, a great mystic, but his business was to help the asuras. Nowadays we are actually seeing that there are some yogés who cater to the senses of materialists, and there are imposters who advertise themselves as God. Maya Dänava was such a person, a god among the demons, and he could perform some wonderful feats, one of which is described here: he made a well filled with nectar and dipped the asuras into that nectarean well. This nectar was known as måta-sanjévayitari, for it could bring a dead body to life. Måta-sanjévayitari is also an Äyur-vedic preparation. It is a kind of liquor that invigorates even a person on the verge of death."
