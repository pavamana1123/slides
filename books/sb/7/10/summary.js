            "content": "Lord Nåsiàhadeva wanted to bestow benedictions upon Prahläda Mahäräja, one after another, but Prahläda Mahäräja, thinking them impediments on the path of spiritual progress, did not accept any of them. Instead, he fully surrendered at the Lord's lotus feet. He said: \"If anyone engaged in the devotional service of the Lord prays for personal sense gratification, he cannot be called a pure devotee or even a devotee. He may be called only a merchant engaged in the business of give and take. Similarly, a master who wants to please his servant after taking service from him is also not a real master.\" Prahläda Mahäräja, therefore, did not ask anything from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Rather, he said that if the Lord wanted to give him a benediction, he wanted the Lord to assure him that he would never be induced to take any benedictions for the sake of material desires. Exchanges of devotional service for lusty desires are always very prominent. As soon as lusty desires awaken, one's senses, mind, life, soul, religious principles, patience, intelligence, shyness, beauty, strength, memory and truthfulness are all vanquished. One can render unalloyed devotional service only when there are no material desires in one's mind."

            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead was greatly pleased with Prahläda Mahäräja for his unalloyed devotion, yet the Lord provided him one material benediction-that he would be perfectly happy in this world and live his next life in Vaikuëöha. The Lord gave him the benediction that he would be the king of this material world until the end of the manvantara millennium and that although in this material world, he would have the facility to hear the glories of the Lord and depend fully on the Lord, performing service to Him in uncontaminated bhakti-yoga. The Lord advised Prahläda to perform sacrifices through bhakti-yoga, for this is the duty of a king."

In response to this prayer, the Lord assured him that in the family of such a pure devotee as he, not only the devotee's father but his forefathers for twenty-one generations are liberated. The Lord also asked Prahläda to perform the ritualistic ceremonies appropriate after his father's death."

The Lord advised Lord Brahmä not to offer benedictions to asuras as he had to Hiraëyakaçipu, for such benedictions indulge them. Then Lord Nåsiàhadeva disappeared. On that day, Prahläda Mahäräja was installed on the throne of the world by Lord Brahmä and Çukräcärya."

Çiçupäla, of course, had merged into the existence of the Lord and thus achieved säyujya-mukti. Närada Muni praised Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja because the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, was the greatest well-wisher and friend of the Päëòavas and almost always stayed in their house. Thus the fortune of the Päëòavas was greater than that of Prahläda Mahäräja."

Because of this defeat, Lord Rudra, Çiva, dismantled Tripura; thus he became famous as Tripuräri. For this, Rudra is very much appreciated and worshiped by the demigods. This narration occurs at the end of the chapter."
