Therefore, kindly do not tempt me with these illusions. I am very much afraid of material conditions, and I desire to be liberated from materialistic life. It is for this reason that I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet.",

This attachment is based on lusty desires for sense gratification, specifically sexual enjoyment. Kämais tais tair håta-jïänäù:  (birth, death, old age and disease), one must take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for without the Supreme Personality of Godhead one cannot get release from materialistic life. Atheistic men are very much attached to material enjoyment. Therefore if they get some opportunity to achieve more and more material enjoyment, they take it. Prahläda Mahäräja, however, was very careful in this regard. Although born of a materialistic father, because he was a devotee he had no material desires (anyäbhiläñitä-çünyam [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11])."
