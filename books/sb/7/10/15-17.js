    "translation": "Prahläda Mahäräja said: O Supreme Lord, because You are so merciful to the fallen souls, I ask You for only one benediction. I know that my father, at the time of his death, had already been purified by Your glance upon him, but because of his ignorance of Your beautiful power and supremacy, he was unnecessarily angry at You, falsely thinking that You were the killer of his brother. Thus he directly blasphemed Your Lordship, the spiritual master of all living beings, and committed heavily sinful activities directed against me, Your devotee. I wish that he be excused for these sinful activities.",

Prahläda Mahäräja offered this prayer to the Lord for the sake of his father. As a Vaiñëava son, despite all the inconveniences imposed upon him by his father, he could not forget his father's affection."
