    "translation": "It does not matter that you are in the material world. You should always, continuously, hear the instructions and messages given by Me and always be absorbed in thought of Me, for I am the Supersoul existing in the core of everyone's heart. Therefore, give up fruitive activities and worship Me.",

            "content": "When a devotee becomes materially very opulent, one should not think that he is enjoying the results of his fruitive activities. A devotee in this material world uses all material opulences for the service of the Lord because he is planning how to serve the Lord with these opulences, as advised by the Lord Himself. Whatever material opulence is within his possession he engages to expand the glories and service of the Lord. A devotee never performs any fruitive or ritualistic ceremony to enjoy the results of such karma. Rather, a devotee knows that karma-käëòa is meant for the less intelligent man. Narottama däsa Öhäkura says in his prema-bhakti-candrikä, karma-käëòa, jïäna-käëòa, kevala viñera bhäëòa: both karma-käëòa and jïäna-käëòa-fruitive activities and speculation about the Supreme Lord—are like pots of poison. One who is attracted to karma-käëòa and jïäna-käëòa spoils his existence as a human being. Therefore a devotee is never interested in karma-käëòa or jïäna-käëòa, but is simply interested in favorable service to the Lord (änukülyena kåñëänuçélanam ), or cultivation of spiritual activities in devotional service."
