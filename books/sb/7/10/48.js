Great saintly persons know this very well, and therefore they constantly visit this house.",

This is the nature of a pure devotee; he always thinks himself to be the lowest, to be incompetent and unqualified. Thus after hearing the narration of Prahläda Mahäräja's activities, Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, who was on the same standard of devotional service as Prahläda, might have been thinking of his own humble position. Närada Muni, however, could understand Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira's mind, and therefore he immediately encouraged him by saying that the Päëòavas were not less fortunate; they were as good as Prahläda Mahäräja because although Lord Nåsiàhadeva appeared for Prahläda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form as Kåñëa was always living with the Päëòavas. Although the Päëòavas, because of the influence of Kåñëa's yogamäyä, could not think of their fortunate position, every saintly person, including the great sage Närada, could understand it, and therefore they constantly visited Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira."

            "content": "Any pure devotee who is constantly conscious of Kåñëa is naturally very fortunate. The word nå-loke, meaning \"within the material world,\" indicates that before the Päëòavas there had been many, many devotees, such as the descendants of the Yadu dynasty and Vasiñöha, Maréci, Kaçyapa, Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, who were all extremely fortunate. The Päëòavas, however, were better than all of them because Kåñëa Himself lived with them constantly. Närada Muni therefore specifically mentioned that within this material world (nå-loke) the Päëòavas were the most fortunate."
