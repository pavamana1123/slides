But if I have to ask You for any benediction, I pray that in whatever forms of life I may take my birth, under any circumstances, I will not be bereft of Your transcendental devotional service.\" Devotees are always on the positive platform, in contrast to the Mäyävädés, who want to make everything impersonal or void. One cannot remain void (çünyavädé); rather, one must possess something. Therefore, the devotee, on the positive side, wants to possess something, and this possession is very nicely described by Prahläda Mahäräja, who says, \"If I must take some benediction from You, I pray that within the core of my heart there may be no material desires.\" The desire to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not at all material."
