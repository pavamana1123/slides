    "translation": "The Lord, Çré Kåñëa, appeared as a human being, yet He performed many uncommon and wonderful pastimes by His own potency. How can I say more about His activities than what has already been said by great saintly persons? Everyone can be purified by His activities, simply by hearing about them from the right source.",

One should not be influenced by the illusory energy and think Lord Kåñëa to be an ordinary human being. Those who really seek the Absolute Truth come to the understanding that Kåñëa is everything (väsudevaù samam iti). Such great souls are very rare. Nonetheless, if one studies the entire Bhagavad-gétä as it is, Kåñëa is very easy to understand. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is just trying to make Kåñëa known all over the world as the Supreme Personality of Godhead (kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam ). If people take this movement seriously, their lives as human beings will be successful."
