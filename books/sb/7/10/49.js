    "translation": "The impersonal Brahman is Kåñëa Himself because Kåñëa is the source of the impersonal Brahman. He is the origin of the transcendental bliss sought by great saintly persons, yet He, the Supreme Person, is your most dear friend and constant well-wisher and is intimately related to you as the son of your maternal uncle. Indeed, He is always like your body and soul. He is worshipable, yet He acts as your servant and sometimes as your spiritual master.",

            "content": "There is always a difference of opinion about the Absolute Truth. One class of transcendentalists concludes that the Absolute Truth is impersonal, and another class concludes that the Absolute Truth is a person. In Bhagavad-gétä, the Absolute Truth is accepted as the Supreme Person. Indeed, that Supreme Person Himself, Lord Kåñëa, instructs in Bhagavad-gétä, brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham  \"while speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief.\" The Lord also said, kutas tvä kaçmalam idaà viñame samupasthitam: \"My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you?\" Such was the intimate relationship between the Päëòavas and Kåñëa. In the same way, a pure devotee of the Lord is always with Kåñëa through thick and thin; his way of life is Kåñëa. This is the statement of the authority Çré Närada Muni."
