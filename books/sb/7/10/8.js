Liberation means freedom from lusty desires because it is only due to such desires that one must accept repeated birth and death. As long as one's lusty desires are unfulfilled, one must take birth after birth to fulfill them. Because of material desires, therefore, one performs various types of activities and receives various types of bodies with which to try to fulfill desires that are never satisfied. The only remedy is to take to devotional service, which begins when one is free from all material desires. Anyäbhiläñitä-çünyam [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11]. Anya-abhiläñitä means \"material desire,\" and çünyam means \"free from.\" The spiritual soul has spiritual activities and spiritual desires, as described by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu: mama janmani janmanéçvare bhavatäd bhaktir ahaituké tvayi ). If one wants to stop repeated birth and death, one must take to the devotional service of the Lord."
