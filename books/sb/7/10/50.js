    "translation": "Exalted persons like Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä could not properly describe the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. May the Lord, who is always worshiped as the protector of all devotees by great saints who observe vows of silence, meditation, devotional service and renunciation, be pleased with us.",

Nonetheless, devotees like the Päëòavas, the gopés, the cowherd boys, Mother Yaçodä, Nanda Mahäräja and all the inhabitants of Våndävana do not need to practice conventional processes of meditation to attain the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He remains with them through thick and thin. Therefore a saint like Närada, understanding the difference between transcendentalists and pure devotees, always prays that the Lord will be pleased with him."
