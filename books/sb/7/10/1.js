    "translation": "The saint Närada Muni continued: Although Prahläda Mahäräja was only a boy, when he heard the benedictions offered by Lord Nåsiàhadeva he considered them impediments on the path of devotional service. Thus he smiled very mildly and spoke as follows.",

Therefore although Prahläda Mahäräja, Dhruva Mahäräja, Ambaréña Mahäräja, Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja and many devotee kings were materially very opulent, they accepted their material opulence in the service of the Lord, not for their personal sense gratification. Of course, possessing material opulence is always fearful because under the influence of material opulence one may be misdirected from devotional service. Nonetheless, a pure devotee (anyäbhiläñitä-çünyam [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11]) is never misdirected by material opulence. On the contrary, whatever he possesses he engages one hundred percent in the service of the Lord. When one is allured by material possessions, they are considered to be given by mäyä, but when one uses material possessions fully for service, they are considered God's gifts, or facilities offered by Kåñëa for enhancing one's devotional service."
