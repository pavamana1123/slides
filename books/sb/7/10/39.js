    "synonyms": "enaù—this sinful activity (of blaspheming the Supreme Lord); pürva-kåtam—executed in previous births; yat—which; tat—that; räjänaù—kings; kåñëa-vairiëaù—always acting as enemies of Kåñëa; jahuù—gave up; te—all of them; ante—at the time of death; tat-ätmänaù—attaining the same spiritual body and form; kéöaù—a worm; peçaskåtaù—(captured by) a black drone; yathä—just like.",
    "translation": "Not only Çiçupäla and Dantavakra but also many, many other kings who acted as enemies of Kåñëa attained salvation at the time of death. Because they thought of the Lord, they received spiritual bodies and forms the same as His, just as worms captured by a black drone obtain the same type of body as the drone.",

            "content": "The mystery of yogic meditation is explained here. Real yogés always meditate on the form of Viñëu within their hearts. Consequently, at the time of death they give up their bodies while thinking of the form of Viñëu and thus attain Viñëuloka, Vaikuëöhaloka, where they receive bodily features the same as those of the Lord. From the Sixth Canto we have already learned that when the Viñëudütas came from Vaikuëöha to deliver Ajämila, they looked exactly like Viñëu, with four hands and the same features as Viñëu. Therefore, we may conclude that if one practices thinking of Viñëu and is fully absorbed in thinking of Him at the time of death, one returns home, back to Godhead. Even enemies of Kåñëa who thought of Kåñëa in fear (bhaya), such as King Kaàsa, received bodies in a spiritual identity similar to that of the Lord."
