Here we see that although Prahläda was perfect in every respect, he nonetheless followed the instructions of the brähmaëas who performed the Vedic rituals. Therefore in society there must be a very intelligent class of leaders who are well versed in the Vedic knowledge so that they can guide the entire populace to follow the Vedic principles and thus gradually become most perfect and eligible to return home, back to Godhead."
