This constant thought of the Lord makes the devotee eligible to return home, back to Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti mäm eti: after giving up his body, a devotee does not again receive a material body, but goes back to Godhead and receives a spiritual body resembling those of the Lord's eternal associates whose activities he followed. However the devotee likes to serve the Lord, he may constantly think of the Lord's associates—the cowherd boys, the gopés, the Lord's father and mother, His servants and the trees, land, animals, plants and water in the Lord's abode. Because of constantly thinking of these features, one acquires a transcendental position. Kings like Çiçupäla, Dantavakra, Kaàsa, Pauëòraka, Narakäsura and Sälva were all similarly delivered. This is confirmed by Madhväcärya:"

The jïäna-bhakta, the devotee who follows the path of jïäna, also attains the same destination. If even the enemies of the Lord achieve salvation by constantly thinking about the Lord, what is to be said of pure devotees who always engage in the Lord's service and who think of nothing but the Lord in every activity?"
