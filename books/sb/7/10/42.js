Although He expands into unlimited forms, He is still the original, and although He is the oldest person, He always appears as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful and all-knowing forms of the Lord cannot be understood by the academic wisdom of the Vedas, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.\" (BS 5.33) The Brahma-saàhitä describes the avatäras. Indeed, all the avatäras are described in the authentic scriptures. No one can become an avatära, or incarnation, although this has become fashionable in the age of Kali. The avatäras are described in the authentic scriptures (çästras), and therefore before one risks accepting a pretender as an avatära, one should refer to the çästras. The çästras say everywhere that Kåñëa is the original Personality of Godhead and that He has innumerable avatäras, or incarnations. Elsewhere in the Brahma-saàhitä it is said, rämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan: (BS 5.39) Räma, Nåsiàha, Varäha and many others are consecutive expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After Kåñëa comes Balaräma, after Balaräma is Saìkarñaëa, then Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Näräyaëa and then the puruña-avatäras—Mahä-Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. All of them are avatäras."

The Kåñëa consciousness movement is spreading all over the world with two aims—to establish Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and to kill all the pretenders who falsely present themselves as avatäras. The preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement must carry this conviction very carefully within their hearts and kill the demons who in many tactful ways vilify the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. If we take shelter of Nåsiàhadeva and Prahläda Mahäräja, it will be easier to kill the demons who are against Kåñëa and to thus reestablish Kåñëa's supremacy. Kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam: . If we can be successful in getting the mercy of Prahläda Mahäräja and also that of Nåsiàhadeva, then our Kåñëa consciousness movement will be extremely successful."

Following in the footsteps of Prahläda Mahäräja, we should reject all the rascals who pretend to be God. We must accept Kåñëa and His incarnations, and no one else."
