            "content": "This verse further clarifies the comparison of a devotee to a child. If a mother leaves her small child in his bed or cradle and goes away to attend to some family duties, the child immediately understands that his mother has gone away, and therefore he cries. But as soon as the mother returns and cares for the child, the child laughs and becomes jubilant. Similarly, Prahläda Mahäräja, being always absorbed in thoughts of Kåñëa, sometimes felt separation, thinking, \"Where is Kåñëa?\" This is explained by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Çünyäyitaà jagat sarvaà govinda-viraheëa me. When an exalted devotee feels that Kåñëa is invisible, having gone away, he cries in separation, and sometimes, when he sees that Kåñëa has returned to care for him, he laughs, just as a child sometimes laughs upon understanding that his mother is taking care of him. These symptoms are called bhäva. In The Nectar of Devotion, various bhävas, ecstatic conditions of a devotee, are fully described. These bhävas are visible in the activities of a perfect devotee."
