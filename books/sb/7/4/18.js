    "translation": "The valleys between the mountains became fields of pleasure for Hiraëyakaçipu, by whose influence all the trees and plants produced fruits and flowers profusely in all seasons. The qualities of pouring water, drying and burning, which are all qualities of the three departmental heads of the universe—namely Indra, Väyu and Agni—were all directed by Hiraëyakaçipu alone, without assistance from the demigods.",

Here it is mentioned that the three modes of nature (påthag guëän) act under the direction of different demigods. For example, King Indra is in charge of pouring water, the demigod Väyu controls the air and dries up the water, whereas the demigod controlling fire burns everything. Hiraëyakaçipu, however, by dint of his austere performance of mystic yoga, became so powerful that he alone took charge of everything, without assistance from the demigods."
