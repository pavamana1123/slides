    "translation": "A father and mother are always affectionate to their children. When the children are disobedient the parents chastise them, not due to enmity but only for the child's instruction and welfare. How did Hiraëyakaçipu, the father of Prahläda Mahäräja, chastise such a noble son? This is what I am eager to know.",
