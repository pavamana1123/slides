After he received these benedictions, his body, which had been almost entirely consumed, was revived with full beauty and a luster like gold. Nonetheless, he continued to be envious of Lord Viñëu, unable to forget Lord Viñëu's having killed his brother. Hiraëyakaçipu conquered everyone in the ten directions and the three worlds and brought all living entities, both demigods and asuras, under his control. Becoming the master of all places, including the residence of Indra, whom he had driven out, he began enjoying life in great luxury and thus became mad. All the demigods but Lord Viñëu, Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva came under his control and began serving him, but despite all his material power he was dissatisfied because he was always puffed up, proud of transgressing the Vedic regulations. All the brähmaëas were dissatisfied with him, and they cursed him with determination. Eventually, all the living entities within the universe, represented by the demigods and sages, prayed to the Supreme Lord for relief from Hiraëyakaçipu's rule."

            "content": "Lord Viñëu informed the demigods that they and the other living entities would be saved from the fearful conditions created by Hiraëyakaçipu. Since Hiraëyakaçipu was the oppressor of all the demigods, the followers of the Vedas, the cows, the brähmaëas and the religious, saintly persons, and since he was envious of the Supreme Lord, he would naturally be killed very soon. Hiraëyakaçipu's last exploit would be to torment his own son Prahläda, who was a mahä-bhägavata, an exalted Vaiñëava. Then his life would end. When the demigods were thus reassured by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everyone was satisfied, knowing that the miseries inflicted upon them by Hiraëyakaçipu would come to an end."
