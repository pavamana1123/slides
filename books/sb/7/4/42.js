    "translation": "Because of his association with perfect, unalloyed devotees who had nothing to do with anything material, Prahläda Mahäräja constantly engaged in the service of the Lord's lotus feet. By seeing his bodily features when he was in perfect ecstasy, persons very poor in spiritual understanding became purified. In other words, Prahläda Mahäräja bestowed upon them transcendental bliss.",

In such material conditions, one cannot have an undisturbed mind, but since bhakti is unconditional (ahaituky apratihatä), Prahläda Mahäräja was never disturbed by the chastisements of Hiraëyakaçipu. On the contrary, the bodily symptoms of his ecstatic love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead turned the minds of his friends, who had also been born in atheistic families. Instead of being disturbed by the torments of his father, Prahläda influenced these friends and cleansed their minds. A devotee is never contaminated by material conditions, but persons subjected to material conditions can become spiritually advanced and blissful upon seeing the behavior of a pure devotee."
