    "translation": "Who could list the innumerable transcendental qualities of Prahläda Mahäräja? He had unflinching faith in Väsudeva, Lord Kåñëa [the son of Vasudeva], and unalloyed devotion to Him. His attachment to Lord Kåñëa was natural because of his previous devotional service. Although his good qualities cannot be enumerated, they prove that he was a great soul [mahätmä].",

Prahläda Mahäräja was a devotee of Lord Nåsiàha, who is Keçava, Kåñëa Himself. Therefore when this verse says väsudeve bhagavati, one should understand that Prahläda Mahäräja's attachment for Nåsiàhadeva was attachment for Kåñëa, Väsudeva, the son of Vasudeva. Prahläda Mahäräja, therefore, is described as a great mahätmä. As the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-gétä :"

Such a great soul is very rare.\" A great devotee of Kåñëa, the son of Vasudeva, is a great soul very rarely to be found. Prahläda Mahäräja's attachment for Kåñëa will be explained in the next verse. Kåñëa-graha-gåhétätmä. Prahläda Mahäräja's heart was always filled with thoughts of Kåñëa. Therefore Prahläda Mahäräja is the ideal devotee in Kåñëa consciousness."
