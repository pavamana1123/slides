    "translation": "O my dear King, Hiraëyakaçipu was always drunk on strong-smelling wines and liquors, and therefore his coppery eyes were always rolling. Nonetheless, because he had powerfully executed great austerities in mystic yoga, although he was abominable, all but the three principal demigods—Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu—personally worshiped him to please him by bringing him various presentations with their own hands.",

Hiraëyakaçipu was so powerful that everyone but the three principal demigods—namely Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu—engaged in his service. Madhväcärya says, ädityä vasavo rudräs tri-vidhä hi surä yataù. There are three kinds of demigods—the Adityas, the Vasus and the Rudras—beneath whom are the other demigods, like the Maruts and Sädhyas (marutaç caiva viçve ca sädhyäç caiva ca tad-gatäù). Therefore all the demigods are called tri-piñöapa, and the same word tri applies to Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu."
