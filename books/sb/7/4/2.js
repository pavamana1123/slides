If one possesses more and more, a benediction itself may become a curse, for just as achieving material opulence in this material world requires great strength and endeavor, maintaining it also requires great endeavor. Lord Brahmä informed Hiraëyakaçipu that although he was ready to offer him whatever he had asked, the result of the benedictions would be very difficult for Hiraëyakaçipu to maintain. Nonetheless, since Brahmä had promised, he wanted to grant all the benedictions asked. The word durlabhän indicates that one should not take benedictions one cannot enjoy peacefully."
