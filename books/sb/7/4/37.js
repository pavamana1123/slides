    "translation": "From the very beginning of his childhood, Prahläda Mahäräja was uninterested in childish playthings. Indeed, he gave them up altogether and remained silent and dull, being fully absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness. Since his mind was always affected by Kåñëa consciousness, he could not understand how the world goes on being fully absorbed in the activities of sense gratification.",

He is seen in His eternal form of Çyämasundara, situated within the heart of the devotee.\" An exalted devotee, or mahätmä, who is rarely to be seen, remains fully conscious of Kåñëa and constantly sees the Lord within the core of his heart. It is sometimes said that when one is influenced by evil stars like Saturn, Rähu or Ketu, he cannot make advancement in any prospective activity. In just the opposite way, Prahläda Mahäräja was influenced by Kåñëa, the supreme planet, and thus he could not think of the material world and live without Kåñëa consciousness. That is the sign of a mahä-bhägavata. Even if one is an enemy of Kåñëa, a mahä-bhägavata sees him to be also engaged in Kåñëa's service. Another crude example is that everything appears yellow to the jaundiced eye. Similarly, to a mahä-bhägavata, everyone but himself appears to be engaged in Kåñëa's service."

The symptoms of such natural attachment for Kåñëa are described in this verse. Although Prahläda Mahäräja was only a boy, he had no interest in playing. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam , viraktir anyatra ca: the symptom of perfect Kåñëa consciousness is that one loses interest in all material activities. For a small boy to give up playing is impossible, but Prahläda Mahäräja, being situated in first-class devotional service, was always absorbed in a trance of Kåñëa consciousness. Just as a materialistic person is always absorbed in thoughts of material gain, a mahä-bhägavata like Prahläda Mahäräja is always absorbed in thoughts of Kåñëa."
