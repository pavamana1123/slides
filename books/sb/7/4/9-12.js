    "translation": "The steps of King Indra's residence were made of coral, the floor was bedecked with invaluable emeralds, the walls were of crystal, and the columns of vaidürya stone. The wonderful canopies were beautifully decorated, the seats were bedecked with rubies, and the silk bedding, as white as foam, was decorated with pearls. The ladies of the palace, who were blessed with beautiful teeth and the most wonderfully beautiful faces, walked here and there in the palace, their ankle bells tinkling melodiously, and saw their own beautiful reflections in the gems. The demigods, however, being very much oppressed, had to bow down and offer obeisances at the feet of Hiraëyakaçipu, who chastised the demigods very severely and for no reason. Thus Hiraëyakaçipu lived in the palace and severely ruled everyone.",

            "content": "Hiraëyakaçipu was so powerful in the heavenly planets that all the demigods except Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu were forced to engage in his service. Indeed, they were afraid of being severely punished if they disobeyed him. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté has compared Hiraëyakaçipu to Mahäräja Vena, who was also atheistic and scornful of the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas. Yet Mahäräja Vena was afraid of some of the great sages such as Bhågu, whereas Hiraëyakaçipu ruled in such a way that everyone feared him but Lord Viñëu, Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva. Hiraëyakaçipu was so alert against being burnt to ashes by the anger of great sages like Bhågu that by dint of austerity he surpassed their power and placed even them under his subordination. It appears that even in the higher planetary systems, to which people are promoted by pious activities, disturbances are created by asuras like Hiraëyakaçipu. No one in the three worlds can live in peace and prosperity without disturbance."
