    "translation": "Although Prahläda Mahäräja was born in a family of asuras, he himself was not an asura but a great devotee of Lord Viñëu. Unlike the other asuras, he was never envious of Vaiñëavas. He was not agitated when put into danger, and he was neither directly nor indirectly interested in the fruitive activities described in the Vedas. Indeed, he considered everything material to be useless, and therefore he was completely devoid of material desires. He always controlled his senses and life air, and being of steady intelligence and determination, he subdued all lusty desires.",

            "content": "From this verse we discover that a man is not qualified or disqualified simply by birth. Prahläda Mahäräja was an asura by birth, yet he possessed all the qualities of a perfect brähmaëa (brahmaëyaù çéla-sampannaù). Anyone can become a fully qualified brähmaëa under the direction of a spiritual master. Prahläda Mahäräja provided a vivid example of how to think of the spiritual master and accept his directions calmly."
