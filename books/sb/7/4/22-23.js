            "content": "The two words tasyai käñöhäyai are very significant. Everywhere, in every direction, in every heart and in every atom, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in His features as Brahman and Paramätmä. Then what is the purpose of saying tasyai käñöhäyai—\"in that direction where Hari is situated?\" During Hiraëyakaçipu's time, his influence was everywhere, but he could not force his influence into the places where the Supreme Personality of Godhead had His pastimes. For example, on this earth there are such places as Våndävana and Ayodhyä, which are called dhämas. In the dhäma, there is no influence from Kali-yuga or any demon. If one takes shelter of such a dhäma, worship of the Lord becomes very easy, and resultant spiritual advancement quickly takes place. In fact, in India one may still go to Våndävana and similar places to achieve the results of spiritual activities quickly."
