            "content": "Of all sinful activities, an offense to a pure devotee, or Vaiñëava, is the most severe. An offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava is so disastrous that Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has compared it to a mad elephant that enters a garden and causes great havoc by uprooting many plants and trees. If one is an offender at the lotus feet of a brähmaëa or Vaiñëava, his offenses uproot all his auspicious activities. One should therefore very carefully guard against committing vaiñëava-aparädha, or offenses at the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava. Here the Lord clearly says that although Hiraëyakaçipu had received benedictions from Lord Brahmä, these benedictions would be null and void as soon as he committed an offense at the lotus feet of Prahläda Mahäräja, his own son. A Vaiñëava like Prahläda Mahäräja is described herein as nirvaira, having no enemies. Elsewhere in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is said, ajäta-çatravaù çäntäù sädhavaù sädhu-bhüñaëäù: a devotee has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime. A devotee does not create enmity with anyone, but if someone becomes his enemy, that person will be vanquished by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, despite whatever benedictions he may have received from other sources. Hiraëyakaçipu was certainly enjoying the fruitful results of his austerities, but here the Lord says that as soon as he committed an offense at the lotus feet of Prahläda Mahäräja he would be ruined. One's longevity, opulence, beauty, education and whatever else one may possess as a result of pious activities cannot protect one if one commits an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava. Despite whatever one possesses, if one offends the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava he will be vanquished."
