    "translation": "Hiraëyakaçipu became the conqueror of the entire universe. Indeed, that great demon conquered all the planets in the three worlds-upper, middle and lower-including the planets of the human beings, the Gandharvas, the Garuòas, the great serpents, the Siddhas, Cäraëas and Vidyädharas, the great saints, Yamaräja, the Manus, the Yakñas, the Räkñasas, the Piçäcas and their masters, and the masters of the ghosts and Bhütas. He defeated the rulers of all the other planets where there are living entities and brought them under his control. Conquering the abodes of all, he seized their power and influence.",

            "content": "The word garuòa in this verse indicates that there are planets of great birds like Garuòa. Similarly, the word uraga indicates that there are planets of enormous serpents. Such a description of the various planets of the universe may challenge modern scientists who think that all planets but this earth are vacant. These scientists claim to have launched excursions to the moon, where they have found no living entities but only big craters full of dust and stone, although in fact the moon is so brilliant that it acts like the sun in illuminating the entire universe. Of course, it is not possible to convince modern scientists of the Vedic information about the universe. Nonetheless, we are not very much impressed by the words of scientists who say that all other planets are vacant and that only the earth is full of living entities."
