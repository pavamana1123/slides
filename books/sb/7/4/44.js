One cannot inquire about transcendental subject matters from a layman. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam , bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti: one must try to understand Kåñëa by devotional service and from a devotee. Therefore Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja was quite right in wanting to learn further about Prahläda Mahäräja from Çré Närada Muni."
