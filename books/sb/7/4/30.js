Therefore, a pure devotee, who has no motives, has all good qualities, material and spiritual. If one is spiritually advanced, being a staunch, liberal devotee of the Lord, all good qualities are manifest in his body. On the other hand, haräv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guëäù: if one is not a devotee, even if he has some materially good qualities, they have no value. That is the verdict of the Vedas."
