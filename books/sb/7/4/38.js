    "translation": "Prahläda Mahäräja was always absorbed in thought of Kåñëa. Thus, being always embraced by the Lord, he did not know how his bodily necessities, such as sitting, walking, eating, lying down, drinking and talking, were being automatically performed.",

            "content": "A small child, while being cared for by his mother, does not know how the needs of the body for eating, sleeping, lying down, passing water and evacuating are being fulfilled. He is simply satisfied to be on the lap of his mother. Similarly, Prahläda Mahäräja was exactly like a small child, being cared for by Govinda. The necessary activities of his body were performed without his knowledge. As a father and mother care for their child, Govinda cared for Prahläda Mahäräja, who remained always absorbed in thoughts of Govinda. This is Kåñëa consciousness. Prahläda Mahäräja is the vivid example of perfection in Kåñëa consciousness."
