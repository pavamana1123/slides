    "translation": "(The qualities of Mahäräja Prahläda, the son of Hiraëyakaçipu, are described herewith.) He was completely cultured as a qualified brähmaëa, having very good character and being determined to understand the Absolute Truth. He had full control of his senses and mind. Like the Supersoul, he was kind to every living entity and was the best friend of everyone. To respectable persons he acted exactly like a menial servant, to the poor he was like a father, to his equals he was attached like a sympathetic brother, and he considered his teachers, spiritual masters and older Godbrothers to be as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was completely free from unnatural pride that might have arisen from his good education, riches, beauty, aristocracy and so on.",

            "content": "\"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness-these are the qualities by which the brähmaëas work.\"  These qualities are manifest in the body of a Vaiñëava. Therefore a perfect Vaiñëava is also a perfect brähmaëa, as indicated here by the words brahmaëyaù çéla-sampannaù. A Vaiñëava is always determined to understand the Absolute Truth, and to understand the Absolute Truth one needs to have full control over his senses and mind. Prahläda Mahäräja possessed all these qualities. A Vaiñëava is always a well-wisher to everyone. The six Gosvämés, for example, are described in this way: dhérädhéra jana-priyau. They were popular with both the gentle and the ruffians. A Vaiñëava must be equal to everyone, regardless of one's position. Ätmavat: a Vaiñëava should be like Paramätmä. Éçvaraù sama-bhütänäà håd-deçe 'rjuna tiñöhati. Paramätmä does not hate anyone; indeed, He is in the heart of a brähmaëa, but he is also even in the heart of a pig. As the moon never refuses to distribute its pleasing rays even to the home of a caëòäla, a Vaiñëava never refuses to act for everyone's welfare. Therefore a Vaiñëava is always obedient to the spiritual master (ärya). The word ärya refers to one who is advanced in knowledge. One who is deficient in knowledge cannot be called ärya. At the present, however, the word ärya is used to refer to those who are godless. This is the unfortunate situation of Kali-yuga."
