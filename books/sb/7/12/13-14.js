    "translation": "According to the rules and regulations mentioned above, one who is twice-born, namely a brähmaëa, kñatriya or vaiçya, should reside in the guru-kula under the care of the spiritual master. There he should study and learn all the Vedic literatures along with their supplements and the Upaniñads, according to his ability and power to study. If possible, the student or disciple should reward the spiritual master with the remuneration the spiritual master requests, and then, following the master's order, the disciple should leave and accept one of the other äçramas, namely the gåhastha-äçrama, vänaprastha-äçrama or sannyäsa-äçrama, as he desires.",

            "content": "To study the Vedas and understand them, of course, requires some special intelligence, but the members of the three higher sections of society—namely the brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas—must learn the Vedic literatures according to their capability and power to understand. In other words, studying the Vedic literatures is compulsory for everyone but the çüdras and antyajas. The Vedic literature gives the knowledge that can lead one to understand the Absolute Truth—Brahman, Paramätmä or Bhagavän. Guru-kula, or the reformatory educational institution, should be used only to understand Vedic knowledge. At the present time there are many educational institutions for training and technology, but such knowledge has nothing to do with understanding of the Absolute Truth. Technology, therefore, is meant for the çüdras, whereas the Vedas are meant for the dvijas. Consequently this verse states, dvijo 'dhétyävabudhya ca trayéà säìgopaniñadam. At the present time, in the age of Kali, practically everyone is a çüdra, and no one is a dvija. Therefore the condition of society has very much deteriorated."

            "content": "Another point to be observed from this verse is that from the brahmacäré-äçrama one may accept the sannyäsa-äçrama, vänaprastha-äçrama or gåhastha-äçrama. It is not compulsory for a brahmacäré to become a gåhastha. Because the ultimate aim is to understand the Absolute Truth, there is no necessity of going through all the different äçramas. Thus one may proceed to the sannyäsa-äçrama directly from the brahmacäré-äçrama. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura accepted the sannyäsa-äçrama directly from the brahmacäré-äçrama. In other words, His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura did not think it compulsory to accept the gåhastha-äçrama or vänaprastha-äçrama."
