    "translation": "A brahmacäré should be quite well behaved and gentle and should not eat or collect more than necessary. He must always be active and expert, fully believing in the instructions of the spiritual master and the çästra. Fully controlling his senses, he should associate only as much as necessary with women or those controlled by women.",

Although when he goes out to beg alms it is necessary to talk with women and with men very much attached to women, this association should be very short, and he should talk with them only about begging alms, and not more. A brahmacäré should be very careful in associating with men who are attached to women."
