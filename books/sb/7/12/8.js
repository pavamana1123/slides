A mother sometimes cares for her son by combing his hair, massaging his body with oil, or bathing him. Similarly, the wife of the teacher is also a mother (guru-patné), and therefore she may also care for the disciple in a motherly way. If the wife of the teacher is a young woman, however, a young brahmacäré should not allow such a mother to touch him. This is strictly prohibited. There are seven kinds of mothers:"

Unnecessary association with women, even with one's mother, sister or daughter, is strictly prohibited. This is human civilization. A civilization that allows men to mix unrestrictedly with women is an animal civilization. In Kali-yuga, people are extremely liberal, but mixing with women and talking with them as equals actually constitutes an uncivilized way of life."
