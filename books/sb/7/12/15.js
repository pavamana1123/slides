As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38), aëòäntara-stha-paramäëu-cayäntara-stham: the Lord is situated within the universe, within the heart of every living entity and also within the atom. We should understand that whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present, He is present with all His paraphernalia, including His name, form, associates and servants. The living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus one should understand that since the Supreme Lord has entered the atom, the living entities are also there. One must accept the inconceivable quality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for no one can understand from the material point of view how the Lord is all-pervasive and yet is situated in His own abode, Goloka Våndävana. This realization is possible if one strictly follows the regulative principles of äçrama (brahmacäré, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa). Çréla Madhväcärya says in this regard:"
