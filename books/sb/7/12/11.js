            "content": "It is sometimes misunderstood that a gåhastha, a householder, is permitted to indulge in sex at any time. This is a wrong conception of gåhastha life. In spiritual life, whether one is a gåhastha, vänaprastha, sannyäsé or brahmacäré, everyone is under the control of the spiritual master. For brahmacärés and sannyäsés there are strong restrictions on sexual indulgence. Similarly, there are strong restrictions for gåhasthas. Gåhasthas should indulge in sex life only in accordance with the order of the guru. Therefore it is mentioned here that one must follow the orders of the spiritual master (guru-våttir vikalpena). When the spiritual master orders, the gåhastha may accept sex life. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä . Dharmäviruddho bhüteñu kämo 'smi: indulgence in sex life without disobedience to the religious rules and regulations constitutes a religious principle. The gåhastha is allowed to indulge in sex life during the period favorable for procreation and in accordance with the spiritual master's order. If the spiritual master's orders allow a gåhastha to engage in sex life at a particular time, then the gåhastha may do so; otherwise, if the spiritual master orders against it, the gåhastha should abstain. The gåhastha must obtain permission from the spiritual master to observe the ritualistic ceremony of garbhädhäna-saàskära. Then he may approach his wife to beget children, otherwise not. A brähmaëa generally remains a brahmacäré throughout his entire life, but although some brähmaëas become gåhasthas and indulge in sex life, they do so under the complete control of the spiritual master. The kñatriya is allowed to marry more than one wife, but this also must be in accordance with the instructions of the spiritual master. It is not that because one is a gåhastha he may marry as many times as he likes and indulge in sex life as he likes. This is not spiritual life. In spiritual life, one must conduct one's whole life under the guidance of the guru. Only one who executes his spiritual life under the direction of the spiritual master can achieve the mercy of Kåñëa. Yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädaù. If one desires to advance in spiritual life but he acts whimsically, not following the orders of the spiritual master, he has no shelter. Yasyäprasädän na gatiù kuto 'pi. Without the spiritual master's order, even the gåhastha should not indulge in sex life."
