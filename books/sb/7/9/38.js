    "translation": "In this way, my Lord, You appear in various incarnations as a human being, an animal, a great saint, a demigod, a fish or a tortoise, thus maintaining the entire creation in different planetary systems and killing the demoniac principles. According to the age, O my Lord, You protect the principles of religion. In the age of Kali, however, You do not assert Yourself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore You are known as Triyuga, or the Lord who appears in three yugas.",

Similarly, Lord Caitanya appeared in order to protect the fallen souls of Kali-yuga. There are four yugas, or millenniums—Satya, Tretä, Dväpara and Kali. In all the yugas but Kali-yuga, the Lord appears in various incarnations and asserts Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but although Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who appears in Kali-yuga, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He never asserted Himself as such. On the contrary, whenever Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu was addressed as being as good as Kåñëa, He blocked His ears with His hands, denying His identity with Kåñëa, because He was playing the part of a devotee. Lord Caitanya knew that in Kali-yuga there would be many bogus incarnations pretending to be God, and therefore He avoided asserting Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, in many Vedic literatures, especially in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

The entire Kåñëa consciousness movement is based on the principles of the saìkértana movement inaugurated by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Therefore one who tries to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the medium of the saìkértana movement knows everything perfectly. He is sumedhas, a person with substantial intelligence."
