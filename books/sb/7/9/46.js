    "translation": "O Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are ten prescribed methods on the path to liberation—to remain silent, not to speak to anyone, to observe vows, to amass all kinds of Vedic knowledge, to undergo austerities, to study the Vedas and other Vedic literatures, to execute the duties of varëäçrama-dharma, to explain the çästras, to stay in a solitary place, to chant mantras silently, and to be absorbed in trance. These different methods for liberation are generally only a professional practice and means of livelihood for those who have not conquered their senses. Because such persons are falsely proud, these procedures may not be successful.",

He can do this simply by discharging devotional service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays.\" The real purpose of human life is to attain liberation from material entanglement. Such liberation may be achieved by many methods (tapasä brahmacaryeëa çamena ca damena ca ), but all of them more or less depend on tapasya, austerity, which begins with celibacy. Çukadeva Gosvämé says that those who are väsudeva-paräyaëa, who have fully surrendered to the lotus feet of Lord Väsudeva, Kåñëa, automatically achieve the results of mauna (silence), vrata (vows) and other such methods simply by discharging devotional service. In other words, these methods are not so powerful. If one takes to devotional service, all of them are very easily performed."

            "content": "Mauna, for example, does not mean that one should just stop speaking. The tongue is meant for speaking, although sometimes, to make a big show, a person remains silent. There are many who observe silence some day in a week. Vaiñëavas, however, do not observe such silence. Silence means not speaking foolishly. Speakers at assemblies, conferences and meetings generally speak foolishly like toads. This is described by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé as väco vegam. One who wants to say something can show himself to be a big orator, but rather than go on speaking nonsense, better to remain silent. This method of silence, therefore, is recommended for persons very attached to speaking nonsense. One who is not a devotee must speak nonsensically because he does not have the power to speak about the glories of Kåñëa. Thus whatever he says is influenced by the illusory energy and is compared to the croaking of a frog. One who speaks about the glories of the Lord, however, has no need to be silent. Caitanya Mahäprabhu recommends, kértanéyaù sadä hariù:  one should go on chanting the glories of the Lord twenty-four hours a day. There is no question of becoming mauna, or silent."

Therefore unless one is extremely advanced in Kåñëa consciousness, one should not imitate Haridäsa Öhäkura, who had no other business than chanting the holy name always, twenty-four hours a day. Prahläda Mahäräja does not condemn such a process; he accepts it, but without active service to the Lord, simply by such methods one generally cannot attain liberation. One cannot attain liberation simply by false pride."
