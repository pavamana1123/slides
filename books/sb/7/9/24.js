My dear Lord, I request You to place me in touch with Your pure devotee and let me serve him as a sincere servant.",

By following in the footsteps of Prahläda Mahäräja, one should gain thorough experience that all material opulence is perishable at every moment. Even this body, for which we try to acquire so many sensual pleasures, may perish at any time. The soul, however, is eternal. Na hanyate hanyamäne çarére:  the soul is never vanquished, even when the body is destroyed. An intelligent man, therefore, should care for the happiness of the spirit soul, not of the body. Even if one receives a body with a long duration of life, like those of Lord Brahmä and the other great demigods, it will also be destroyed, and therefore an intelligent man should be concerned with the imperishable spirit soul."

If one wants to save himself from material nature's onslaughts, which arise because of the material body, one must become Kåñëa conscious and try to fully understand Kåñëa. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä . The illusory human civilization that perpetually endeavors for happiness through material advancement is rejected by Prahläda Mahäräja and those who strictly follow in his footsteps."

            "content": "There are different types of material opulence, known technically as bhukti, mukti and siddhi. Bhukti refers to being situated in a very good position, like a position with the demigods in the higher planetary systems, where one can enjoy material sense gratification to the greatest extent. Mukti refers to being disgusted with material advancement and thus desiring to become one with the Supreme. Siddhi refers to executing a severe type of meditation, like that of the yogés, to attain eight kinds of perfection (aëimä, laghimä, mahimä, etc.). All who desire some material advancement through bhukti, mukti or siddhi are punishable in due course of time, and they return to material activities. Prahläda Mahäräja rejected them all; he simply wanted to engage as an apprentice under the guidance of a pure devotee."
