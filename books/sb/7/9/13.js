    "translation": "O my Lord, all the demigods, headed by Lord Brahmä, are sincere servants of Your Lordship, who are situated in a transcendental position. Therefore they are not like us [Prahläda and his father, the demon Hiraëyakaçipu]. Your appearance in this fearsome form is Your pastime for Your own pleasure. Such an incarnation is always meant for the protection and improvement of the universe.",

When the Supreme Lord appears in this material world in His various incarnations, He performs two functions—saving the devotee and vanquishing the demon (pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm ). Lord Nåsiàhadeva, for example, appeared for the protection of His devotee. Such pastimes as those of Nåsiàhadeva are certainly not meant to create a fearful situation for the devotees, but nonetheless the devotees, being very simple and faithful, were afraid of the fierce incarnation of the Lord. Therefore Prahläda Mahäräja, in the following prayer, requests the Lord to give up His anger."
