    "synonyms": "tasmät—therefore; aham—I; vigata-viklavaù—having given up contemplation of being unfit; éçvarasya—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; sarva-ätmanä—in full surrender; mahi—glory; gåëämi—I shall chant or describe; yathä manéñam—according to my intelligence; nécaù—although lowborn (my father being a great demon, devoid of all good qualities); ajayä—because of ignorance; guëa-visargam—the material world (wherein the living entity takes birth according to the contamination of the modes of nature); anupraviñöaù—entered into; püyeta—may be purified; yena—by which (the glory of the Lord); hi—indeed; pumän—a person; anuvarëitena—being chanted or recited.",
    "translation": "Therefore, although I was born in a demoniac family, I may without a doubt offer prayers to the Lord with full endeavor, as far as my intelligence allows. Anyone who has been forced by ignorance to enter the material world may be purified of material life if he offers prayers to the Lord and hears the Lord's glories.",

None of these qualifications will engage one in devotional service. With devotion one should feel, \"God is great, and I am very small. Therefore my duty is to offer my prayers to the Lord.\" Only on this basis can one understand and render service to the Lord. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä :"
