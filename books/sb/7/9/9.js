    "translation": "Prahläda Mahäräja continued: One may possess wealth, an aristocratic family, beauty, austerity, education, sensory expertise, luster, influence, physical strength, diligence, intelligence and mystic yogic power, but I think that even by all these qualifications one cannot satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, one can satisfy the Lord simply by devotional service. Gajendra did this, and thus the Lord was satisfied with him.",

As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, only by devotional service can the Lord be known (bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti ). This is the verdict of all çästras. Neither by speculation nor by material qualifications can one understand or approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
