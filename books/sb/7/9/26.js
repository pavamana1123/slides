    "translation": "O my Lord, O Supreme, because I was born in a family full of the hellish material qualities of passion and ignorance, what is my position? And what is to be said of Your causeless mercy, which was never offered even to Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva or the goddess of fortune, Lakñmé? You never put Your lotus hand upon their heads, but You have put it upon mine.",

This is the meaning of causeless mercy. The causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead may be bestowed upon anyone, regardless of his position in this material world. Everyone is eligible to worship the Supreme Lord, irrespective of his material position. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä :"

The symptoms of passion and ignorance are described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  as lust and hankering (tadä rajas tamo-bhäväù käma-lobhädayaç ca ye). Prahläda Mahäräja, being a great devotee, thought the body born of his father to be born of passion and ignorance, but because Prahläda was fully engaged in the service of the Lord, his body did not belong to the material world. The pure Vaiñëava's body is spiritualized even in this life. For example, when iron is put into a fire it becomes red-hot and is no longer iron but fire. Similarly, the so-called material bodies of devotees who fully engage in the devotional service of the Lord, being constantly in the fire of spiritual life, have nothing to do with matter, but are spiritualized."

In other words, devotional service is so great that when it is offered even by those born in low families, the Lord accepts it as being more valuable than the service offered by the goddess of fortune. Lord Brahmä, King Indra and the other demigods living in the upper planetary systems are situated in a different spirit of consciousness, and therefore they are sometimes troubled by demons, but a devotee, even if situated in the lower planets, enjoys life in Kåñëa consciousness under any circumstances. parataù svataù karmataù: as he acts himself, as he is instructed by others or as he performs his material activities, he enjoys life in every respect. In this regard, Madhväcärya quotes the following verses, which are mentioned in the Brahma-tarka:"
