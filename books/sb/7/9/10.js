    "translation": "If a brähmaëa has all twelve of the brahminical qualifications [as they are stated in the book called Sanat-sujäta] but is not a devotee and is averse to the lotus feet of the Lord, he is certainly lower than a devotee who is a dog-eater but who has dedicated everything—mind, words, activities, wealth and life—to the Supreme Lord. Such a devotee is better than such a brähmaëa because the devotee can purify his whole family, whereas the so-called brähmaëa in a position of false prestige cannot purify even himself.",

There are four varëas and four äçramas, which divide human society, but the central principle is to become a first-class pure devotee. It is said in the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya:"

In answer to such envy, Prahläda Mahäräja says that one who has been born in a brähmaëa family but is falsely proud of his prestigious position cannot even purify himself, not to speak of his family, whereas if a caëòäla, a lowborn person, is a devotee and has fully surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord, he can purify his entire family. We have had actual experience of how Americans and Europeans, because of their full Kåñëa consciousness, have purified their whole families, so much so that a mother of a devotee, at the time of her death, inquired about Kåñëa with her last breath. Therefore it is theoretically true and has been practically proven that a devotee can give the best service to his family, his community, his society and his nation. The foolish accuse a devotee of following the principle of escapism, but actually the fact is that a devotee is the right person to elevate his family. A devotee engages everything in the service of the Lord, and therefore he is always exalted."
