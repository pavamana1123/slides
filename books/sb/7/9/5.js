    "translation": "When Lord Nåsiàhadeva saw the small boy Prahläda Mahäräja prostrated at the soles of His lotus feet, He became most ecstatic in affection toward His devotee. Raising Prahläda, the Lord placed His lotus hand upon the boy's head because His hand is always ready to create fearlessness in all of His devotees.",

In this material world, everyone is in fearful consciousness (sadä samudvigna-dhiyäm), and the only means to make everyone fearless is Kåñëa consciousness. When Lord Nåsiàhadeva appeared, all the devotees became fearless. The devotee's hope of becoming fearless is to chant the holy name of Lord Nåsiàhadeva. Yato yato yämi tato nåsiàhaù: wherever we go, we must always think of Lord Nåsiàhadeva. Thus there will be no fear for the devotee of the Lord."
