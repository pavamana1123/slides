    "translation": "My Lord, O unlimited reservoir of transcendental qualities, You have killed my father, Hiraëyakaçipu, and saved me from his sword. He had said very angrily, \"If there is any supreme controller other than me, let Him save you. I shall now sever your head from your body.\" Therefore I think that both in saving me and in killing him, You have acted just to prove true the words of Your devotee. There is no other cause.",

He has no friend and no enemy, but as one desires benefits from the Lord, the Lord is very pleased to award them. The lower and higher positions of different living entities are due to their desires, for the Lord, being equal to all, fulfills everyone's desires. The killing of Hiraëyakaçipu and saving of Prahläda Mahäräja also strictly followed this law of the supreme controller's activities. When Prahläda's mother, Hiraëyakaçipu's wife, Kayädhu, was under the protection of Närada, she prayed for the protection of her son from the enemy, and Närada Muni gave assurance that Prahläda Mahäräja would always be saved from the enemy's hands. Thus when Hiraëyakaçipu was going to kill Prahläda Mahäräja, the Lord saved Prahläda to fulfill His promise in Bhagavad-gétä (kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati . The Lord has multifarious energies, through which everything is done. Thus when He personally does something, it is only to satisfy His devotee. The Lord is known as bhakta-vatsala because He very much favors His devoted servant."
