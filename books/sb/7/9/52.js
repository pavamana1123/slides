It is not very extraordinary that the Lord offered His devotee all benedictions. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said in effect, \"I fulfill the desires of everyone. Since you are My devotee, whatever you want for yourself will naturally be given, but if you pray for anyone else, that prayer also will be fulfilled.\" Thus if we approach the Supreme Lord or His devotee, or if we are blessed by a devotee, naturally we will automatically achieve the benedictions of the Supreme Lord. Yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädaù. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says that if one pleases the Vaiñëava spiritual master, all of one's desires will be fulfilled."
