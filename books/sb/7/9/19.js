    "synonyms": "bälasya—of a little child; na—not; iha—in this world; çaraëam—shelter (protection); pitarau—the father and mother; nåsiàha—O my Lord Nåsiàhadeva; na—neither; ärtasya—of a person suffering from some disease; ca—also; agadam—medicine; udanvati—in the water of the ocean; majjataù—of a person who is drowning; nauù—the boat; taptasya—of a person suffering from a condition of material misery; tat-pratividhiù—the counteraction (invented for stopping the suffering of material existence); yaù—that which; iha—in this material world; aïjasä—very easily; iñöaù—accepted (as a remedy); tävat—similarly; vibho—O my Lord, O Supreme; tanu-bhåtäm—of the living entities who have accepted material bodies; tvat-upekñitänäm—who are neglected by You and not accepted by You.",
    "translation": "My Lord Nåsiàhadeva, O Supreme, because of a bodily conception of life, embodied souls neglected and not cared for by You cannot do anything for their betterment. Whatever remedies they accept, although perhaps temporarily beneficial, are certainly impermanent. For example, a father and mother cannot protect their child, a physician and medicine cannot relieve a suffering patient, and a boat on the ocean cannot protect a drowning man.",

            "content": "Through parental care, through remedies for different kinds of disease, and through means of protection on the water, in the air and on land, there is always an endeavor for relief from various kinds of suffering in the material world, but none of them are guaranteed measures for protection. They may be beneficial temporarily, but they afford no permanent benefit. Despite the presence of a father and mother, a child cannot be protected from accidental death, disease and various other miseries. No one can help, including the parents. Ultimately the shelter is the Lord, and one who takes shelter of the Lord is protected. This is guaranteed. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä . Nature (prakåti) is so strong that no one can overcome her stringent laws. So-called scientists, philosophers, religionists and politicians should therefore conclude that they cannot offer facilities to the people in general. They should make vigorous propaganda to awaken the populace and raise them to the platform of Kåñëa consciousness. Our humble attempt to propagate the Kåñëa consciousness movement all over the world is the only remedy that can bring about a peaceful and happy life. We can never be happy without the mercy of the Supreme Lord (tvad-upekñitänäm). If we keep displeasing our supreme father, we shall never be happy within this material world, in either the upper or lower planetary systems."
