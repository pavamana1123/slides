    "translation": "Lord Brahmä could then see You possessing thousands and thousands of faces, feet, heads, hands, thighs, noses, ears and eyes. You were very nicely dressed, being decorated and bedecked with varieties of ornaments and weapons. Seeing You in the form of Lord Viñëu, Your symptoms and form being transcendental, Your legs extending from the lower planets, Lord Brahmä achieved transcendental bliss.",

            "content": "Lord Brahmä, being completely pure, could see the original form of the Lord as Viñëu, having many thousands of faces and forms. This process is called self-realization. Genuine self-realization consists not of perceiving the impersonal effulgence of the Lord, but seeing face to face the transcendental form of the Lord. As distinctly mentioned here, Lord Brahmä saw the Supreme Lord as mahä-puruña, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Arjuna also saw Kåñëa in this same way. Therefore he told the Lord, paraà brahma paraà dhäma pavitraà paramaà bhavän puruñaà çäçvataà divyam:  \"You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person.\" The Lord is parama-puruña, the supreme form. Puruñaà çäçvatam: He is everlastingly the supreme enjoyer. It is not that the impersonal Brahman assumes a form; on the contrary, the impersonal Brahman effulgence is an emanation from the supreme form of the Lord. Upon being purified, Brahmä could see the supreme form of the Lord. The impersonal Brahman cannot have heads, noses, ears, hands and legs. This is not possible, for these are attributes of the Lord's form."

            "content": "The word mäyämayam means \"spiritual knowledge.\" This is explained by Madhväcärya. Mäyämayaà jïäna-svarüpam. The word mäyämayam, describing the Lord's form, should not be taken to mean illusion. Rather, the Lord's form is factual, and seeing this form is the result of perfect knowledge. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä: bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän mäà prapadyate . The word jïänavän refers to one who is perfectly in knowledge. Such a person can see the Personality of Godhead, and therefore he surrenders unto the Lord. The Lord's being symptomized by a face, nose, ears and so on is eternal. Without such a form, no one can be blissful. The Lord, however, is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha, as stated in the çästra (éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù (BS 5.1)). When one is in perfect transcendental bliss, he can see the Lord's supreme form (vigraha). In this regard, Çréla Madhväcärya says:"
