            "content": "The word susamähitaù means \"very attentive\" or \"fully fixed.\" The ability to fix the mind in this way is a result of yoga-siddhi, mystic perfection. As it is stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam , dhyänävasthita-tad-gatena manasä paçyanti yaà yoginaù. One attains yogic perfection when he is freed from all material diversions and his mind is fixed upon the lotus feet of the Lord. This is called samädhi or trance. Prahläda Mahäräja attained that stage beyond the senses. Because he was engaged in service, he felt transcendentally situated, and naturally his mind and attention became saturated in transcendence. In that condition, he began to offer his prayers as follows."
