Käma, krodha, lobha, moha, mada and mätsarya—lust, anger, greed, illusion, pride and envy—all have their proper use for the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotee. A devotee of the Lord cannot tolerate blasphemy of the Lord or His other devotees, and the Lord also cannot tolerate blasphemy of a devotee. Thus Lord Nåsiàhadeva was so very angry that the great demigods like Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva and even the goddess of fortune, who is the Lord's constant companion, could not pacify Him, even after offering prayers of glorification and praise. No one was able to pacify the Lord in His anger, but because the Lord was willing to exhibit His affection for Prahläda Mahäräja, all the demigods and the others present before the Lord pushed Prahläda Mahäräja forward to pacify Him."
