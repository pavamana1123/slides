Therefore although the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, is full in Himself, He appears in different yugas to demand the surrender of the conditioned souls so that they will benefit by becoming free from the material clutches. In conclusion, the more we engage in Kåñëa consciousness and render service unto the Lord, the more we benefit. Kåñëa does not need service from any of us."
