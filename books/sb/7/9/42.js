    "translation": "O my Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, original spiritual master of the entire world, what is the difficulty for You, who manage the affairs of the universe, in delivering the fallen souls engaged in Your devotional service? You are the friend of all suffering humanity, and for great personalities it is necessary to show mercy to the foolish. Therefore I think that You will show Your causeless mercy to persons like us, who engage in Your service.",

In other words, one must become the servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord. If one wants to become the servant of the Lord directly, this is not as fruitful as engaging in the service of the Lord's servant. This is the direction of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who shows us the way to become gopé-bhartuù pada-kamalayor däsa-däsänudäsaù . The Lord says, \"Engaging in the service of My devotee is better than trying to engage in My devotional service.\""

            "content": "Another significant point in this verse is that by devotional service Prahläda Mahäräja does not want to benefit alone. Rather, he prays to the Lord that all of us fallen souls in this material world may, by the grace of the Lord, engage in the service of His servant and thus be delivered. The grace of the Lord is not at all difficult for the Lord to bestow, and thus Prahläda Mahäräja wants to save the whole world by spreading Kåñëa consciousness."
