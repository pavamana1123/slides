    "translation": "The goddess of fortune, Lakñméjé, was requested to go before the Lord by all the demigods present, who because of fear could not do so. But even she had never seen such a wonderful and extraordinary form of the Lord, and thus she could not approach Him.",

By the grace of the Lord, a devotee can very easily understand how the Lord can appear in any form He likes. Therefore the devotee is never afraid of such a form. Because of special favor bestowed upon Prahläda Mahäräja, he remained silent and unafraid, even though all the demigods, including even Lakñmédevé, were afraid of Lord Nåsiàhadeva. Näräyaëa-paräù sarve na kutaçcana bibhyati . Not only is a pure devotee of Näräyaëa like Prahläda Mahäräja unafraid of any dangerous condition of material life, but also if the Lord appears to mitigate the fear of a devotee, the devotee maintains his status of fearlessness in all circumstances."
