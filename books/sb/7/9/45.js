    "translation": "Sex life is compared to the rubbing of two hands to relieve an itch. Gåhamedhis, so-called gåhasthas who have no spiritual knowledge, think that this itching is the greatest platform of happiness, although actually it is a source of distress. The kåpaëas, the fools who are just the opposite of brähmaëas, are not satisfied by repeated sensuous enjoyment. Those who are dhéra, however, who are sober and who tolerate this itching, are not subjected to the sufferings of fools and rascals.",

            "content": "Materialists think that sexual indulgence is the greatest happiness in this material world, and therefore they make elaborate plans to satisfy their senses, especially the genitals. This is generally found everywhere, and specifically found in the Western world, where there are regular arrangements to satisfy sex life in different ways. Actually, however, this has not made anyone happy. Even the hippies, who have given up all the materialistic comforts of their fathers and grandfathers, cannot give up the sensational happiness of sex life. Such persons are described here as kåpaëas, misers. The human form of life is a great asset, for in this life one can fulfill the goal of existence. Unfortunately, however, because of a lack of education and culture, people are victimized by the false happiness of sex life. Prahläda Mahäräja therefore advises one not to be misled by this civilization of sense gratification, and especially not by sex life. Rather, one should be sober, avoid sense gratification and be Kåñëa conscious. The lusty person, who is compared to a foolish miser, never gets happiness by sense gratification. The influence of material nature is very difficult to surpass, but as stated by Kåñëa in Bhagavad-gétä , mäm eva ye prapadyante, mäyäm etäà taranti te: if one voluntarily submits to the lotus feet of Kåñëa, he can be saved very easily."

If sexual thoughts came to him, he would spit with disgust."
