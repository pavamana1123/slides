    "translation": "My dear Lord, when You appeared as Hayagréva, with the head of a horse, You killed two demons known as Madhu and Kaiöabha, who were full of the modes of passion and ignorance. Then You delivered the Vedic knowledge to Lord Brahmä. For this reason, all the great saints accept Your forms as transcendental, untinged by material qualities.",

As mentioned herein, the Lord in the form of Hayagréva killed two demons named Madhu and Kaiöabha when they attacked Lord Brahmä. Modern demons think that there was no life in the beginning of creation, but from Çrémad-Bhägavatam we understand that the first living creature created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead was Lord Brahmä, who is full of Vedic understanding. Unfortunately, those entrusted with distributing Vedic knowledge, such as the devotees engaged in spreading Kåñëa consciousness, may sometimes be attacked by demons, but they must rest assured that demoniac attacks will not be able to harm them, for the Lord is always prepared to give them protection. The Vedas provide the knowledge by which we can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead (vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù ). The devotees of the Lord are always ready to spread knowledge by which one may understand the Lord through Kåñëa consciousness, but the demons, being unable to understand the Supreme Lord, are full of ignorance and passion. Thus the Lord, whose form is transcendental, is always ready to kill the demons. By culturing the mode of goodness, one can understand the position of the transcendental Lord and how the Lord is always prepared to remove all obstacles on the path of understanding Him."

Whenever the Lord appears, He appears in His original transcendental form, which is spiritual and blissful. But unintelligent men, such as the Mäyävädés, cannot understand the transcendental form of the Lord, and therefore the Lord chastises them by saying, avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà tanum äçritam: ). Since the demons are always ready to oppose Vedic civilization, they are sure to be killed by the transcendental form of the Lord."
