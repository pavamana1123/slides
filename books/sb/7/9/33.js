    "translation": "This cosmic manifestation, the material world, is also Your body. This total lump of matter is agitated by Your potent energy known as käla-çakti, and thus the three modes of material nature are manifested. You awaken from the bed of Çeña, Ananta, and from Your navel a small transcendental seed is generated. It is from this seed that the lotus flower of the gigantic universe is manifested, exactly as a banyan tree grows from a small seed.",

            "content": "The three different forms of Mahä-Viñëu—namely Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, who are the origin of creation and maintenance—are gradually being described. From Mahä-Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu is generated, and from Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu gradually expands. Thus Mahä-Viñëu is the original cause of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, and from Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu comes the lotus flower from which Lord Brahmä is manifested. Thus the original cause of everything is Viñëu, and consequently the cosmic manifestation is not different from Viñëu. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä , wherein Kåñëa says, ahaà sarvasya prabhavo mattaù sarvaà pravartate: \"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.\" Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu is an expansion of Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu, who is an expansion of Saìkarñaëa. In this way, Kåñëa is ultimately the cause of all causes (sarva-käraëa-käraëam (BS 5.1)). The conclusion is that both the material world and spiritual world are considered to be the body of the Supreme Lord. We can understand that the material body is caused by the spiritual body and is therefore an expansion of the spiritual body. Thus when one takes up spiritual activities, one's entire material body is spiritualized. Similarly, in this material world, when the Kåñëa consciousness movement expands, the entire material world becomes spiritualized. As long as we do not realize this, we live in the material world, but when we are fully Kåñëa conscious we live not in the material world but in the spiritual world."
