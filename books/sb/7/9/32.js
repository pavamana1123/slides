    "translation": "O my Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, after the annihilation the creative energy is kept in You, who appear to sleep with half-closed eyes. Actually, however, You do not sleep like an ordinary human being, for You are always in a transcendental stage, beyond the creation of the material world, and You always feel transcendental bliss. As Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu, You thus remain in Your transcendental status, not touching material objects. Although You appear to sleep, this sleeping is distinct from sleeping in ignorance.",

After the annihilation of this cosmic manifestation, He keeps Himself in transcendental bliss. The word yoga-nidräm is used in reference to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should understand that this nidrä, or sleep, is not like our nidrä in the mode of ignorance. The Lord is always situated in transcendence. He is sac-cid-änanda (BS 5.1)—eternally in bliss—and thus He is not disturbed by sleep like ordinary human beings. It should be understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in transcendental bliss in all stages. Çréla Madhväcärya concisely states that the Lord is turya-sthitaù, always situated in transcendence. In transcendence there is no such thing as jägaraëa-nidrä-susupti—wakefulness, sleep and deep sleep."

            "content": "The practice of yoga is similar to the yoga-nidrä of Mahä-Viñëu. Yogés are advised to keep their eyes half closed, but this state is not at all one of sleep, although imitation yogés, especially in the modern age, manifest their so-called yoga by sleeping. In the çästra, yoga is described as dhyänävasthita, a state of full meditation, but this is meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Dhyänävasthita-tad-gatena manasä: the mind should always be situated at the lotus feet of the Lord. Yoga practice does not mean sleeping. The mind should always be actively fixed at the lotus feet of the Lord. Then one's practice of yoga will be successful."
