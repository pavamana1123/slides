    "translation": "My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, because of my association with material desires, one after another, I was gradually falling into a blind well full of snakes, following the general populace. But Your servant Närada Muni kindly accepted me as his disciple and instructed me how to achieve this transcendental position. Therefore, my first duty is to serve him. How could I leave his service?",

On the contrary, he asked the Lord to engage him in the service of His servant Närada Muni. This is the symptom of a pure devotee. One should serve the spiritual master first. It is not that one should bypass the spiritual master and desire to serve the Supreme Lord. This is not the principle for a Vaiñëava. Narottama däsa Öhäkura says:"

Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu advised that one become a servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord (gopé-bhartuù pada-kamalayor däsa-däsänudäsaù  one can achieve the seed of devotional service by the mercy of the guru, the spiritual master, and then by the mercy of Kåñëa. This is the secret of success. First one should try to please the spiritual master, and then one should attempt to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura also says, yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädo. One should not attempt to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead by concoction. One must first be prepared to serve the spiritual master, and when one is qualified he is automatically offered the platform of direct service to the Lord. Therefore Prahläda Mahäräja proposed that he engage in the service of Närada Muni. He never proposed that he engage directly in the service of the Lord. This is the right conclusion. Therefore he said, so 'haà kathaà nu visåje tava bhåtya-seväm: \"How can I give up the service of my spiritual master, who has favored me in such a way that I am now able to see You face to face?\" Prahläda Mahäräja prayed to the Lord that he might continue to engage in the service of his spiritual master, Närada Muni."
