Nonetheless, although they make elaborate political, social and cultural plans, they have all been described herein as vimüòha—fools. The material world has been described in Bhagavad-gétä as duùkhälayam açäçvatam —temporary and miserable—but these fools are trying to turn the material world into sukhälayam, a place of happiness, not knowing how everything acts by the arrangement of material nature, which works in her own way."

Although the asuras, the godless demons, struggle for existence, they are directly attacked by the goddess Durgä, who is well equipped with ten hands with different types of weapons to punish them. She is carried by her lion carrier, or the modes of passion and ignorance. Everyone struggles very hard to fight through the modes of passion and ignorance and conquer material nature, but at the end everyone is vanquished by nature's laws."

            "content": "There is a river known as Vaitaraëé between the material and spiritual worlds, and one must cross this river to reach the other side, or the spiritual world. This is an extremely difficult task. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä , daivé hy eñä guëa-mayé mama mäyä duratyayä: \"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.\" The same word duratyaya, meaning \"very difficult,\" is used here. Therefore one cannot surpass the stringent laws of material nature except by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Nonetheless, although all materialists are baffled in their plans, they try again and again to become happy in this material world. Therefore they have been described as vimüòha—first-class fools. As for Prahläda Mahäräja, he was not at all unhappy, for although he was in the material world, he was full of Kåñëa consciousness. Those who are Kåñëa conscious, trying to serve the Lord, are not unhappy, whereas one who has no assets in Kåñëa consciousness and is struggling for existence is not only foolish but extremely unhappy also. Prahläda Mahäräja was happy and unhappy simultaneously. He felt happiness and transcendental bliss because of his being Kåñëa conscious, yet he felt great unhappiness for the fools and rascals who make elaborate plans to be happy in this material world."
