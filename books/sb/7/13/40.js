Sometimes one takes birth as an animal and sometimes as a king. When he takes birth as an animal he must lie down on the ground, and when he takes birth as a king or a very rich man he is allowed to lie in first-class rooms in huge palaces decorated with beds and other furniture. Such facilities are not available, however, at the sweet will of the living entity; rather, they are available by the supreme will (parecchayä), or by the arrangement of mäyä. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä :"

By the will of the Supreme, one must take different bodies with different means for lying down."
