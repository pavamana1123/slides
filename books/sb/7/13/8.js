            "content": "So-called svämés and yogés generally make disciples by alluring them with material benefits. There are many so-called gurus who attract disciples by promising to cure their diseases or increase their material opulence by manufacturing gold. These are lucrative allurements for unintelligent men. A sannyäsé is prohibited from making disciples through such material allurements. Sannyäsés sometimes indulge in material opulence by unnecessarily constructing many temples and monasteries, but actually such endeavors should be avoided. Temples and monasteries should be constructed for the preaching of spiritual consciousness or Kåñëa consciousness, not to provide free hotels for persons who are useful for neither material nor spiritual purposes. Temples and monasteries should be strictly off limits to worthless clubs of crazy men. In the Kåñëa consciousness movement we welcome everyone who agrees at least to follow the movement's regulative principles—no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating and no gambling. In the temples and monasteries, gatherings of unnecessary, rejected, lazy fellows should be strictly disallowed. The temples and monasteries should be used exclusively by devotees who are serious about spiritual advancement in Kåñëa consciousness. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains the word ärambhän as meaning maöhädi-vyäpärän, which means \"attempts to construct temples and monasteries.\" The first business of the sannyäsé is to preach Kåñëa consciousness, but if, by the grace of Kåñëa, facilities are available, then he may construct temples and monasteries to give shelter to the serious students of Kåñëa consciousness. Otherwise such temples and monasteries are not needed."
