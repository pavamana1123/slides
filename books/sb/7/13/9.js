    "translation": "A peaceful, equipoised person who is factually advanced in spiritual consciousness does not need to accept the symbols of a sannyäsé, such as the tridaëòa and kamaëòalu. According to necessity, he may sometimes accept those symbols and sometimes reject them.",

            "content": "There are four stages of the renounced order of life—kuöécaka, bahüdaka, parivräjakäcärya and paramahaàsa. Herein, Çrémad-Bhägavatam considers the paramahaàsas among the sannyäsés. The Mäyävädé impersonalist sannyäsés cannot attain the paramahaàsa stage. This is because of their impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth. Brahmeti paramätmeti bhagavän iti çabdyate ). Unless one is in the paramahaàsa stage, he is not eligible to understand the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. For paramahaàsas, or sannyäsés in the Vaiñëava order, preaching is the first duty. To preach, such sannyäsés may accept the symbols of sannyäsa, such as the daëòa and kamaëòalu, or sometimes they may not. Generally the Vaiñëava sannyäsés, being paramahaàsas, are automatically called bäbäjés, and they do not carry a kamaëòalu or daëòa. Such a sannyäsé is free to accept or reject the marks of sannyäsa. His only thought is \"Where is there an opportunity to spread Kåñëa consciousness?\" Sometimes the Kåñëa consciousness movement sends its representative sannyäsés to foreign countries where the daëòa and kamaëòalu are not very much appreciated. We send our preachers in ordinary dress to introduce our books and philosophy. Our only concern is to attract people to Kåñëa consciousness. We may do this in the dress of sannyäsés or in the regular dress of gentlemen. Our only concern is to spread interest in Kåñëa consciousness."
