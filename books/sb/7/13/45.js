Prahläda Mahäräja, who is such a devotee, always defied the false instructions of his father and the so-called teachers who were appointed to teach him. Instead, he simply followed the instructions of Närada Muni, his guru, and thus he always remained a stalwart devotee. This is the nature of an intelligent devotee. The Çrémad-Bhägavatam instructs, yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù . One who is actually very intelligent must join the Kåñëa consciousness movement, realizing his own self as an eternal servant of Kåñëa, and thus practice constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare."
