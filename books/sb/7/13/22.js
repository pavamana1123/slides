Kåñëa is the master of all knowledge (aiçvaryasya samagrasya véryasya yaçasaù çriyaù (Viñëu Puräëa 6.5.47)). The Lord is situated in everyone's heart (éçvaraù sarva-bhütänäà håd-deçe 'rjuna tiñöhati ), and when the Lord is pleased with a devotee, the Lord instructs him. Only to the devotees, however, does the Lord give instructions by which to advance further and further in devotional service. To others, the nondevotees, the Lord gives instructions according to the manner of their surrender. The pure devotee is described by the words bhaktyä kevalayä. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that bhaktyä kevalayä means jïäna-karmädy-amiçrayä, \"unmixed with fruitive activities or speculative knowledge.\" Simply surrendering at the lotus feet is the cause of all a devotee's enlightenment and awareness."
