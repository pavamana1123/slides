    "translation": "During unconsciousness and consciousness, and between the two, he should try to understand the self and be fully situated in the self. In this way, he should realize that the conditional and liberated stages of life are only illusory and not actually factual. With such a higher understanding, he should see only the Absolute Truth pervading everything.",

The marginal state, between consciousness and unconsciousness, has no permanent existence.

Only the Supreme Absolute Truth exists. As confirmed by the Lord in Bhagavad-gétä :"
