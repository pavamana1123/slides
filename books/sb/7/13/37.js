Therefore one should learn from the bumblebee not to keep more money than one needs. Similarly, one should learn from the python to stay in one place for many, many days without food and then eat only if something comes in its own way. Thus the learned brähmaëa gave instructions gained from two creatures, namely the bumblebee and the python."
