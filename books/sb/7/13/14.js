It is therefore said, vaiñëavera kriyä mudrä vijïe nä bhujhaya. A highly advanced Vaiñëava lives in such a way that no one can understand what he is or what he was. Nor should attempts be made to understand the past of a Vaiñëava. Without asking the saintly person about his previous life, Prahläda Mahäräja immediately offered him respectful obeisances."
