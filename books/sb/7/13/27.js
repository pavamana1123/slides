    "synonyms": "sukham—happiness; asya—of him; ätmanaù—of the living entity; rüpam—the natural position; sarva—all; éha—material activities; uparatiù—completely stopping; tanuù—the medium of its manifestation; manaù-saàsparça-jän—produced from demands for sense gratification; dåñövä—after seeing; bhogän—sense enjoyment; svapsyämi—I am sitting silently, thinking deeply about these material activities; saàviçan—entering into such activities.",
    "translation": "The actual form of life for the living entities is one of spiritual happiness, which is real happiness. This happiness can be achieved only when one stops all materialistic activities. Material sense enjoyment is simply imagination. Therefore, considering this subject matter, I have ceased from all material activities and am lying down here.",

Both the Mäyävädés and Vaiñëavas know that in materialistic activities there is no happiness. The Mäyävädé philosophers, therefore, adhering to the slogan brahma satyaà jagan mithyä, want to refrain from false, materialistic activities. They want to stop all activities and merge in the Supreme Brahman. According to the Vaiñëava philosophy, however, if one simply ceases from materialistic activity one cannot remain inactive for very long, and therefore everyone should engage himself in spiritual activities, which will solve the problem of suffering in this material world. It is said, therefore, that although the Mäyävädé philosophers strive to refrain from materialistic activities and merge in Brahman, and although they may actually merge in the Brahman existence, for want of activity they fall down again into materialistic activity (äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù patanty adhaù ). If one works for the sake of pleasing the Supreme Lord—Yajïa, or Viñëu—one is in liberated life. If one fails to do so, however, he remains in a life of bondage."
