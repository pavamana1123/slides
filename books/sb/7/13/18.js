    "translation": "O brähmaëa, fully in knowledge of transcendence, you have nothing to do, and therefore you are lying down. It is also understood that you have no money for sense enjoyment. How then has your body become so fat? Under the circumstances, if you do not consider my question impudent, kindly explain how this has happened.",

The learned sage, however, was quite fat, and therefore Prahläda Mahäräja was very much surprised. Because of being experienced in self-realization, a transcendentalist certainly becomes bright-faced. And one who is advanced in self-realization must be considered to possess the body of a brähmaëa. Because the bright-faced saintly person was lying down and not working and yet was quite fat, Prahläda Mahäräja was puzzled and wanted to question him about this."
