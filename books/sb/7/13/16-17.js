    "translation": "Seeing the saintly person to be quite fat, Prahläda Mahäräja said: My dear sir, you undergo no endeavor to earn your livelihood, but you have a stout body, exactly like that of a materialistic enjoyer. I know that if one is very rich and has nothing to do, he becomes extremely fat by eating and sleeping and performing no work.",

He would become very anxious upon seeing his fat disciples becoming bhogés, or enjoyers of the senses. This attitude is herewith confirmed by Prahläda Mahäräja, who was surprised to see a saintly person adopting äjagara-våtti and becoming very fat. In the material world also, we generally see that when a man who is poor and skinny gradually endeavors to earn money through business or some other means and he then gets the money, he enjoys the senses to his satisfaction. By enjoying the senses one becomes fat. Therefore in spiritual advancement becoming fat is not at all satisfactory."
