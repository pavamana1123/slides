Thus they are unable to sleep at night, and they have to take pills for mental tranquillity to invite sleep. And sometimes even the pills are a failure. Consequently the result of having accumulated money by so much labor is certainly not happiness, but only distress. What is the value of acquiring a comfortable position if one's mind is always disturbed? Narottama däsa Öhäkura has therefore sung:"

Such a life is certainly not very happy, but because of the spell of the illusory energy, materialistic persons engage in such activities."

This literature is not sold for our sense gratification; to spread the Kåñëa consciousness movement we need so many things, and Kåñëa is therefore supplying us the requisite money to advance this mission. The mission of Kåñëa is to spread Kåñëa consciousness all over the world, and for this purpose we naturally must have sufficient money. Therefore, according to the advice of Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé Prabhupäda, we should not give up attachment to money that can spread the Kåñëa consciousness movement.

There is danger for a preacher when he receives great quantities of money, for as soon as he spends even a single cent of the collection for his personal sense gratification, he becomes a fallen victim. The preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement should be extremely careful not to misuse the immense quantities of money needed to spread this movement. Let us not make this money the cause of our distress; it should be used for Kåñëa, and that will cause our eternal happiness. Money is Lakñmé, or the goddess of fortune, the companion of Näräyaëa. Lakñméjé must always remain with Näräyaëa, and then there need be no fear of degradation."
