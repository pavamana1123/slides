    "translation": "My dear King, although you know everything, you have posed some questions, which I shall try to answer according to what I have learned by hearing from authorities. I cannot remain silent in this regard, for a personality like you is just fit to be spoken to by one who desires self-purification.",

            "content": "A saintly person doesn't wish to speak to anyone and everyone, and he is therefore grave and silent. Generally a common man does not need to be advised. Unless one is prepared to take instructions, it is said that a saintly person should not address him, although sometimes, because of great kindness, a saintly person speaks to ordinary men. As for Prahläda Mahäräja, however, since he was not a common, ordinary man, whatever questions he posed would have to be answered, even by a great and exalted personality. Therefore the saintly brähmaëa did not remain silent, but began to answer. These answers, however, were not concocted by him. This is indicated by the words yathä-çrutam, meaning \"as I have heard from the authorities.\" In the paramparä system, when the questions are bona fide the answers are bona fide. No one should attempt to create or manufacture answers. One must refer to the çästras and give answers according to Vedic understanding. The words yathä-çrutam refer to Vedic knowledge. The Vedas are known as çruti because this knowledge is received from authorities. The statements of the Vedas are known as çruti-pramäëa. One should quote evidence from the çruti—the Vedas or Vedic literature—and then one's statements will be correct. Otherwise one's words will proceed from mental concoction."
