            "content": "Here is the difference between Vedic civilization and the modern demoniac civilization. Vedic civilization concerned itself with how to achieve self-realization, and for this purpose one was recommended to have a small income to maintain body and soul together. The society was divided into brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras, and the members of this society would limit their endeavors to meeting their minimum demands. The brähmaëas, in particular, would have no material desires. Because the kñatriyas had to rule the people, it was necessary for them to have money and prestige. But the vaiçyas were satisfied with agricultural produce and milk from the cow, and if by chance there were excess, trade was allowed. The çüdras were also happy, for they would get food and shelter from the three higher classes. In the demoniac civilization of the present day, however, there is no question of brähmaëas or kñatriyas; there are only so-called workers and a flourishing mercantile class who have no goal in life."

            "content": "According to Vedic civilization, the ultimate perfection of life is to take sannyäsa, but at the present moment people do not know why sannyäsa is accepted. Because of misunderstanding, they think that one accepts sannyäsa to escape social responsibilities. But one does not accept sannyäsa to escape from responsibility to society. Generally one accepts sannyäsa at the fourth stage of spiritual life. One begins as a brahmacäré then becomes a gåhastha, a vänaprastha and finally a sannyäsé to take advantage of the duration of one's life by engaging oneself fully in self-realization. Sannyäsa does not mean begging from door to door to accumulate money for sense gratification. However, because in Kali-yuga people are more or less prone to sense gratification, immature sannyäsa is not recommended. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé writes in his Nectar of Instruction:"

We recommend that as soon as money accumulates in our Kåñëa consciousness movement, fifty per cent of it should be invested in printing books, and fifty per cent for expenditures, especially in establishing centers all over the world. The managers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement should be extremely cautious in regard to this point. Otherwise money will be the cause of lamentation, illusion, fear, anger, material attachment, material poverty, and unnecessary hard work. When I was alone in Våndävana, I never attempted to construct maöhäs or temples; rather, I was fully satisfied with the small amount of money I could gather by selling Back to Godhead, and thus I would provide for myself and also print the literature. When I went to foreign countries, I lived according to the same principle, but when Europeans and Americans began to give money profusely, I started temples and Deity worship. The same principle should still be followed. Whatever money is collected should be spent for Kåñëa, and not a farthing for sense gratification. This is the Bhägavata principle."
