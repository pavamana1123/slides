A preacher should personally understand these truths and preach them to everyone. Then there will be peace and tranquillity all over the world."

            "content": "The word sauhådam (\"friendliness\") is very significant in this verse. People are generally ignorant of Kåñëa consciousness, and therefore to become their best well-wisher one should teach them about Kåñëa consciousness without discrimination. Since the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, is situated in the core of everyone's heart, every body is a temple of Viñëu. One should not misuse this understanding as an excuse for such words as daridra-näräyaëa. If Näräyaëa lives in the house of a daridra, a poor man, this does not mean that Näräyaëa becomes poor. He lives everywhere—in the houses of the poor and those of the rich—but in all circumstances He remains Näräyaëa; to think that He becomes either poor or rich is a material calculation. He is always ñaò-aiçvarya-pürëa, full in six opulences, in all circumstances."
