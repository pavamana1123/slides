    "translation": "My dear sons of demons, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, is the original Supersoul, the father of all living entities. Consequently there are no impediments to pleasing Him or worshiping Him under any conditions, whether one be a child or an old man. The relationship between the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always a fact, and therefore there is no difficulty in pleasing the Lord.",

            "content": "\"It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunté, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.\" The Supreme Lord, Näräyaëa, is the seed-giving father of all living entities because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord (mamaiväàço ...jéva-bhütaù ). As there is no difficulty in establishing the intimate relationship between a father and son, there is no difficulty in reestablishing the natural, intimate relationship between Näräyaëa and the living entities. Svalpam apy asya dharmasya träyate mahato bhayät: if one performs even very slight devotional service, Näräyaëa is always ready to save one from the greatest danger. The definite example is Ajämila. Ajämila separated himself from the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing many sinful activities and was condemned by Yamaräja to be very severely punished, but because at the time of death he chanted the name of Näräyaëa, although he was calling not for the Supreme Lord Näräyaëa but for his son named Näräyaëa, he was saved from the hands of Yamaräja. Therefore, pleasing Näräyaëa does not require as much endeavor as pleasing one's family, community and nation. We have seen important political leaders killed for a slight discrepancy in their behavior. Therefore pleasing one's society, family, community and nation is extremely difficult. Pleasing Näräyaëa, however, is not at all difficult; it is very easy."

A slight endeavor in this direction will make the attempt successful, whereas one will never be successful in pleasing his so-called family, society and nation, even if one endeavors to sacrifice his life. The simple endeavor involved in the devotional service of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù , hearing and chanting the holy name of the Lord, can make one successful in pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has therefore bestowed His blessings by saying, paraà vijayate çré-kåñëa-saìkértanam: \"All glories to Çré Kåñëa saìkértana!\" If one wants to derive the actual benefit from this human form, he must take to the chanting of the holy name of the Lord."
