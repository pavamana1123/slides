    "translation": "The human form of life affords one a chance to return home, back to Godhead. Therefore every living entity, especially in the human form of life, must engage in devotional service to the lotus feet of Lord Viñëu. This devotional service is natural because Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the most beloved, the master of the soul, and the well-wisher of all other living beings.",

            "content": "\"The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.\" Simply by understanding these three facts—that the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, is the proprietor of the entire creation, that He is the best well-wishing friend of all living entities, and that He is the supreme enjoyer of everything—one becomes peaceful and happy. For this transcendental happiness, the living entity has wandered throughout the universe in different forms of life and different planetary systems, but because he has forgotten his intimate relationship with Viñëu, he has merely suffered, life after life. Therefore, the educational system in the human form of life should be so perfect that one will understand his intimate relationship with God, or Viñëu. Every living entity has an intimate relationship with God. One should therefore glorify the Lord in the adoration of çänta-rasa or revive his eternal relationship with Viñëu as a servant in däsya-rasa, a friend in sakhya-rasa, a parent in vätsalya-rasa or a conjugal lover in mädhurya-rasa. All these relationships are on the platform of love. Viñëu is the center of love for everyone, and therefore the duty of everyone is to engage in the loving service of the Lord. As stated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead , yeñäm ahaà priya ätmä sutaç ca sakhä guruù suhådo daivam iñöam. In any form of life, we are related with Viñëu, who is the most beloved, the Supersoul, son, friend and guru. Our eternal relationship with God can be revived in the human form of life, and that should be the goal of education. Indeed, that is the perfection of life and the perfection of education."
