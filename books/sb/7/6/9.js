For this purpose, one must first be liberated from material bondage, and especially from household life. Household life is actually a kind of license for a materially attached person by which to enjoy sense gratification under regulative principles. Otherwise there is no need of entering household life."

            "content": "Before entering household life, one should be trained as a brahmacäré, living under the care of the guru, whose place is known as the guru-kula. Brahmacäré guru-kule vasan dänto guror hitam . From the very beginning, a brahmacäré is trained to sacrifice everything for the benefit of the guru. A brahmacäré is advised to go begging alms door to door, addressing all women as mother, and whatever he collects goes to the benefit of the guru. In this way he learns how to control his senses and sacrifice everything for the guru. When he is fully trained, if he likes he is allowed to marry. Thus he is not an ordinary gåhastha who has learned only how to satisfy his senses. A trained gåhastha can gradually give up household life and go to the forest to become increasingly enlightened in spiritual life and at last take sannyäsa. Prahläda Mahäräja explained to his father that to be freed from all material anxieties one should go to the forest. Hitvätma-pätaà gåham andha-küpam. One should give up his household, which is a place for going further and further down into the darkest regions of material existence. The first advice, therefore, is that one must give up household life (gåham andha-küpam). However, if one prefers to remain in the dark well of household life because of uncontrolled senses, he becomes increasingly entangled by ropes of affection for his wife, children, servants, house, money and so on. Such a person cannot attain liberation from material bondage. Therefore children should be taught from the very beginning of life to be first-class brahmacärés. Then it will be possible for them to give up household life in the future."

One who perfectly engages in devotional service is therefore called gosvämé or svämé, master of the senses. Unless one is master of the senses, he should not accept the renounced order of life, sannyäsa. A strong inclination for sense enjoyment is the cause of the material body. Without full knowledge one cannot be unattached to material enjoyment, but as long as one is not in that position one is not fit to return home, back to Godhead."
