    "synonyms": "vitteñu—in material wealth; nitya-abhiniviñöa-cetäù—whose mind is always absorbed; vidvän—having learned; ca—also; doñam—the fault; para-vitta-hartuù—of one who steals the money of others by cheating or by transactions on the black market; pretya—after dying; iha—in this material world; vä—or; athäpi—still; ajita-indriyaù—because of being unable to control the senses; tat—that; açänta-kämaù—whose desires are unsatiated; harate—steals; kuöumbé—too fond of his family.",
    "translation": "If a person too attached to the duties of family maintenance is unable to control his senses, the core of his heart is immersed in how to accumulate money. Although he knows that one who takes the wealth of others will be punished by the law of the government, and by the laws of Yamaräja after death, he continues cheating others to acquire money.",

But at least one should know that one who cheats others to acquire money will be punished by the laws of the government. Nonetheless, people do not care about the laws of this life or those governing the next. Despite whatever knowledge one has, one cannot stop his sinful activities if he is unable to control his senses."
