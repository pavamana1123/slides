    "translation": "Nothing is unobtainable for devotees who have satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the cause of all causes, the original source of everything. The Lord is the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities. For devotees, therefore, who are transcendental to the modes of material nature, what is the use of following the principles of religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation, which are all automatically obtainable under the influence of the modes of nature? We devotees always glorify the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore we need not ask for anything in terms of dharma, käma, artha and mokña.",

            "content": "In an advanced civilization, people are eager to be religious, to be economically well situated, to satisfy their senses to the fullest extent, and at last to attain liberation. However, these are not to be magnified as desirable. Indeed, for a devotee these are all very easily available. Bilvamaìgala Öhäkura said, muktiù svayaà mukulitäïjali sevate 'smän dharmärtha-käma-gatayaù samaya-pratékñäù. Liberation always stands at the door of a devotee, ready to carry out his orders. Material advancement in religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation simply wait to serve a devotee at the first opportunity. A devotee is already in a transcendental position; he does not need further qualifications to be liberated. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä , sa guëän samatétyaitän brahma-bhüyäya kalpate: a devotee is transcendental to the actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature because he is situated on the Brahman platform."

            "content": "Prahläda Mahäräja said, aguëena ca käìkñitena: if one is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the lotus feet of the Lord, he does not need anything in terms of dharma, artha, käma or mokña. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam, therefore, in the beginning of the transcendental literature, it is said, dharmaù projjhita-kaitavo 'tra . Dharma, artha, käma and mokña are kaitava—false and unnecessary. Nirmatsaräëäm, persons who are completely transcendental to the material activities of separateness, who make no distinction between \"mine\" and \"yours,\" but who simply engage in the devotional service of the Lord, are actually fit to accept bhägavata-dharma (dharmän bhagavatän iha). Because they are nirmatsara, not jealous of anyone, they want to make others devotees, even their enemies. In this regard, Çréla Madhväcärya remarks, käìkñate mokña-gam api sukhaà näkäìkñato yathä. Devotees are not desirous of any material happiness, including the happiness derived from liberation. This is called anyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11]. Karmés desire material happiness, and jïänés desire liberation, but a devotee does not desire anything; he is simply satisfied by rendering transcendental loving service at the lotus feet of the Lord and glorifying Him everywhere by preaching, which is his life and soul."
