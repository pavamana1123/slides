            "content": "When a relative dies one certainly becomes very much interested in philosophy, but when the funeral ceremony is over one again becomes attentive to materialism. Even Daityas, who are materialistic persons, sometimes think of philosophy when some relative meets death. The technical term for this attitude of the materialistic person is çmaçäna-vairägya, or detachment in a cemetery or place of cremation. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä, four classes of men receive an understanding of spiritual life and God—ärta (the distressed), jijïäsu (the inquisitive), arthärthé (one who desires material gains) and jïäné (one who is searching for knowledge). Especially when one is very much distressed by material conditions, one becomes interested in God. Therefore Kuntédevé said in her prayers to Kåñëa that she preferred distress to a happy mood of life. In the material world, one who is happy forgets Kåñëa, or God, but sometimes, if one is actually pious but in distress, he remembers Kåñëa. Queen Kuntédevé therefore preferred distress because it is an opportunity for remembering Kåñëa. When Kåñëa was leaving Kuntédevé for His own country, Kuntédevé regretfully said that she was better off in distress because Kåñëa was always present, whereas now that the Päëòavas were situated in their kingdom, Kåñëa was going away. For a devotee, distress is an opportunity to remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly."
