    "synonyms": "viñëuù—Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; dvija—of the brähmaëas and kñatriyas; kriyä-mülaù—whose root is the performance of yajïa and the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas; yajïaù—personified yajïa (Lord Viñëu, who is known as the yajïa-puruña); dharma-mayaù—full of religious principles; pumän—the Supreme Person; deva-åñi—of the demigods and great åñis like Vyäsadeva and Närada; pitå—of the forefathers; bhütänäm—and of all other living entities; dharmasya—of the religious principles; ca—also; paräyaëam—the shelter.",
    "translation": "The basic principle of brahminical culture is to satisfy Lord Viñëu, the personification of sacrificial and ritualistic ceremonies. Lord Viñëu is the personified reservoir of all religious principles, and He is the shelter of all the demigods, the great pitäs, and the people in general. When the brähmaëas are killed, no one will exist to encourage the kñatriyas to perform yajïas, and thus the demigods, not being appeased by yajïa, will automatically die.",

With brahminical culture lost, yajïa would no longer be performed, and for want of yajïa the regular distribution of rainfall would cease (yajïäd bhavati parjanyaù ). Thus there would be disturbances all over the world, and naturally the demigods would be defeated. From this verse we get a clear indication of how human society is disturbed when the Vedic Äryan civilization is killed and the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies performed by the brähmaëas are stopped. Kalau çüdra-sambhavaù: because the population of the modern world consists mostly of çüdras, the brahminical culture is now lost and is extremely difficult to reestablish in a proper way. Therefore Lord Caitanya has recommended the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, which will revive brahminical culture very easily."

            "content": "Because of the increment in demoniac population, people have lost brahminical culture. Nor is there a kñatriya government. Instead, the government is a democracy in which any çüdra can be voted into taking up the governmental reigns and capture the power to rule. Because of the poisonous effects of Kali-yuga, the çästra  says, dasyu-präyeñu räjasu: the government will adopt the policies of dasyus, or plunderers. Thus there will be no instructions from the brähmaëas, and even if there are brahminical instructions, there will be no kñatriya rulers who can follow them. Aside from Satya-yuga, even formerly, in the days when demons were flourishing, Hiraëyakaçipu planned to destroy the brahminical culture and the kñatriya government and thus create chaos all over the world. Although in Satya-yuga this plan was very difficult to execute, in Kali-yuga, which is full of çüdras and demons, the brahminical culture is lost and can be revived only by the chanting of the mahä-mantra. Therefore the Kåñëa consciousness movement, or the Hare Kåñëa movement, has been inaugurated to revive brahminical culture very easily so that people may become happy and peaceful in this life and prepare for elevation in the next. In this regard, Çréla Madhväcärya quotes this verse from the Brahmäëòa Puräëa:"
