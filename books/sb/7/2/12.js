Similarly, there must be kñatriyas to rule the country very nicely according to the injunctions of the çästras, and there must be vaiçyas who can protect the cows. The word gävaù indicates that cows should be given protection. Because the Vedic civilization is lost, cows are not protected, but instead indiscriminately killed in slaughterhouses. Such are the acts of demons. Therefore this is a demoniac civilization. The varëäçrama-dharma mentioned here is essential for human civilization. Unless there is a brähmaëa to guide, a kñatriya to rule perfectly, and a perfect vaiçya to produce food and protect the cows, how will people live peacefully? It is impossible."

In Kali-yuga, trees are indiscriminately and unnecessarily cut for industry, in particular for paper mills that manufacture a profuse quantity of paper for the publication of demoniac propaganda, nonsensical literature, huge quantities of newspapers and many other paper products. This is a sign of a demoniac civilization. The cutting of trees is prohibited unless necessary for the service of Lord Viñëu. Yajïärthät karmaëo'nyatra loko'yaà karma-bandhanaù: ). Yajïa must be performed, as indicated by the superior authorities. The cutting of trees simply to manufacture paper for the publication of unwanted literature is the greatest sinful act."
