    "translation": "As long as the spirit soul is covered by the subtle body, consisting of the mind, intelligence and false ego, he is bound to the results of his fruitive activities. Because of this covering, the spirit soul is connected with the material energy and must accordingly suffer material conditions and reversals, continually, life after life.",

            "content": "The living entity is bound by the subtle body, consisting of the mind, intelligence and false ego. At the time of death, therefore, the position of the mind becomes the cause for the next body. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä ). When the mind is engaged at the lotus feet of Kåñëa, the intelligence is purified, and then the intelligence gets inspiration from the Supersoul (dadämi buddhi-yogaà tam). Thus the living entity makes progress toward liberation from material bondage. The individual living soul is subject to the laws of fruitive activity, but the Supersoul, Paramätmä, is not affected by the fruitive activities of the individual soul. As confirmed in the Vedic Upaniñad, the Paramätmä and the jévätmä, who are likened to two birds, are sitting in the body. The jévätmä is enjoying or suffering by eating the fruits of the bodily activities, but the Paramätmä, who is free from such bondage, witnesses and sanctions the activities of the individual soul as the individual soul desires."
