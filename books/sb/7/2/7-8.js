    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead has given up His natural tendency of equality toward the demons and demigods. Although He is the Supreme Person, now, influenced by mäyä, He has assumed the form of a boar to please His devotees, the demigods, just as a restless child leans toward someone. I shall therefore sever Lord Viñëu's head from His trunk by my trident, and with the profuse blood from His body I shall please my brother Hiraëyäkña, who was so fond of sucking blood. Thus shall I too be peaceful.",

Hiraëyakaçipu thought that Viñëu also becomes partial, like a child whose mind is not steady or resolute. The Lord can change His mind at any time, Hiraëyakaçipu thought, and therefore His words and activities are like those of children. Actually, because the demons are ordinary human beings, their minds change, and being materially conditioned, they think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is conditioned also. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä , avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà tanum äçritam: \"Fools deride Me when I descend in a human form.\""

Therefore, being absorbed in thoughts of Viñëu's form to kill Him, at least they have the opportunity to think of Viñëu unfavorably. Although they are not devotees, their thinking of Viñëu is effective, and thus they generally attain säyujya-mukti. Because the demons consider the Supreme Lord an ordinary living being, they think that they can kill Lord Viñëu as one might kill an ordinary person. Another fact disclosed herein is that demons are very much fond of sucking blood. Indeed, all of them are meat-eaters and bloodsuckers."

Because they are in love with the Supreme Lord, they do not eat anything without offering it first to the Lord. The Lord does not hanker for a small leaf or flower; He has enough to eat. Indeed, He is feeding all living entities. Nonetheless, because He is very merciful and is bhakta-vatsala, very favorable to the devotees, He certainly eats whatever they offer Him with love and devotion. This quality should not be misjudged to be childish. The highest quality of the Supreme Lord is that He is bhakta-vatsala; in other words, He is always extremely pleased with His devotees. As for the word mäyä, when used in reference to the dealings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees, this word means \"affection.\" The actions of the Lord to favor His devotees are not disqualifications but signs of His natural affection."

But the garland that decorates Viñëu's body is as red as blood. When the demons achieve säyujya-mukti and leave behind their sinful activities, they are blessed by Viñëu's garland, which is red like blood. After attaining säyujya-mukti, the demons are sometimes promoted to the Vaikuëöha world, where they receive the reward of the Lord's garland prasäda."
