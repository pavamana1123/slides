There is no one but Brahmä at the time of creation, and therefore he receives his intelligence directly from the Lord through the heart.

            "content": "Lord Brahmä is described in this verse as the original cause of the cosmic manifestation, and this applies to his position in the material world. There are many, many such controllers, all of whom are created by the Supreme Lord, Viñëu. This is illustrated by an incident described in Caitanya-caritämåta. When the Brahmä of this particular universe was invited by Kåñëa to Dvärakä, he thought that he was the only Brahmä. Therefore when Kåñëa inquired from His servant which Brahmä was at the door to visit, Lord Brahmä was surprised. He replied that of course Lord Brahmä, the father of the four Kumäras, was waiting at the door. Later, Lord Brahmä asked Kåñëa why He had inquired which Brahmä had come. He was then informed that there are millions of other Brahmäs because there are millions of universes. Kåñëa then called all the Brahmäs, who immediately came to visit Him. The catur-mukha Brahmä, the four-headed Brahmä of this universe, thought himself a very insignificant creature in the presence of so many Brahmäs with so many heads. Thus although there is a Brahmä who is the engineer of each universe, Kåñëa is the original source of all of them."
