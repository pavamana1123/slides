    "translation": "O Lord Brahmä, your position within this universe is certainly most auspicious for everyone, especially the cows and brähmaëas. Brahminical culture and the protection of cows can be increasingly glorified, and thus all kinds of material happiness, opulence and good fortune will automatically increase. But unfortunately, if Hiraëyakaçipu occupies your seat, everything will be lost.",

            "content": "In this verse the words dvija-gaväà pärameñöhyam indicate the most exalted position of the brähmaëas, brahminical culture and the cows. In Vedic culture, the welfare of the cows and the welfare of the brähmaëas are essential. Without a proper arrangement for developing brahminical culture and protecting cows, all the affairs of administration will go to hell. Being afraid that Hiraëyakaçipu would occupy the post of Brahmä, all the demigods were extremely disturbed. Hiraëyakaçipu was a well-known demon, and the demigods knew that if demons and Räkñasas were to occupy the supreme post, brahminical culture and protection of cows would come to an end. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , the original proprietor of everything is Lord Kåñëa (bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäà sarva-loka-maheçvaram). The Lord, therefore, knows particularly well how to develop the material condition of the living entities within this material world. In every universe there is one Brahmä engaged on behalf of Lord Kåñëa, as confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (, tene brahma hådaya ädi-kavaye). The principal creator in each brahmäëòa is Lord Brahmä, who imparts Vedic knowledge to his disciples and sons. On every planet, the king or supreme controller must be a representative of Brahmä. Therefore, if a Räkñasa, or demon, were situated in Brahmä's post, then the entire arrangement of the universe, especially the protection of the brahminical culture and cows, would be ruined. All the demigods anticipated this danger, and therefore they went to request Lord Brahmä to take immediate steps to thwart Hiraëyakaçipu's plan."

Now again, Hiraëyakaçipu was trying to replace Brahmä. The material world is so situated that even the position of Lord Brahmä, not to speak of ordinary living entities, is sometimes in danger. Nonetheless, until the time of Hiraëyakaçipu, no one had tried to replace Lord Brahmä. Hiraëyakaçipu, however, was such a great demon that he maintained this ambition."

            "content": "The word bhütyai means \"for increasing opulence,\" and the word çreyase refers to ultimately returning home, back to Godhead. In spiritual advancement, one's material position improves at the same time that the path of liberation becomes clear and one is freed from material bondage. If one is situated in an opulent position in spiritual advancement, his opulence never decreases. Therefore such a spiritual benediction is called bhüti or vibhüti. Kåñëa confirms this in Bhagavad-gétä . Yad yad vibhütimat sattvaà. .. mama tejo-'àça-sambhavam: if a devotee advances in spiritual consciousness and thus becomes materially opulent also, his position is a special gift from the Lord. Such opulence is never to be considered material. At the present, especially on this planet earth, the influence of Lord Brahmä has decreased considerably, and the representatives of Hiraëyakaçipu—the Räkñasas and demons—have taken charge. Therefore there is no protection of brahminical culture and cows, which are the basic prerequisites for all kinds of good fortune. This age is very dangerous because society is being managed by demons and Räkñasas."
