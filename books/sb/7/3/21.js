The demigods who reside with Lord Brahmä in Satyaloka go to Vaikuëöhaloka in their present bodily constructions at the time of the dissolution. Therefore although Hiraëyakaçipu had undergone severe austerities, Lord Brahmä predicted that he had to die; he could not become immortal or even gain equal status with the demigods. The great austerities and penances he had performed for so many years could not give him protection from death. This was foretold by Lord Brahmä."
