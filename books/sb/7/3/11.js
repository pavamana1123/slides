After executing severe austerities, people within this material world are promoted to the heavenly planets, but Hiraëyakaçipu wanted them to be unhappy, suffering because of the diplomatic feelings of the demigods, even in the heavenly planets. He wanted those who were harassed in this world by material transactions to be unhappy for the same reason, even in the heavenly planets. Indeed, be wanted to introduce such harassment everywhere. One might ask how this would be possible, since the universal order has been established since time immemorial, but Hiraëyakaçipu was proud to declare that he would be able to do everything by the power of his tapasya. He even wanted to make the Vaiñëavas' position insecure. These are some of the symptoms of asuric determination."
