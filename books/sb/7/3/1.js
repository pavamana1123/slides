    "translation": "Närada Muni said to Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira: The demoniac king Hiraëyakaçipu wanted to be unconquerable and free from old age and dwindling of the body. He wanted to gain all the yogic perfections like aëimä and laghimä, to be deathless, and to be the only king of the entire universe, including Brahmaloka.",

            "content": "Such are the goals of the austerities performed by demons. Hiraëyakaçipu wanted to receive a benediction from Lord Brahmä so that in the future he would be able to conquer Lord Brahmä's abode. Similarly, another demon received a benediction from Lord Çiva but later wanted to kill Lord Çiva through that same benediction. Thus self-interested persons, by demoniac austerity, want to kill even their benedictors, whereas the Vaiñëava wants to remain an ever-existing servant of the Lord and never to occupy the post of the Lord. Through säyujya-mukti, which is generally demanded by asuras, one merges into the existence of the Lord, but although one sometimes thus achieves the goal of the theory of monism, one falls down again to struggle in material existence."
