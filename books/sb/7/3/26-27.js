    "translation": "Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the supreme lord within this universe. At the end of each day of his life, the universe is fully covered with dense darkness by the influence of time, and then again, during his next day, that self-effulgent lord, by his own effulgence, manifests, maintains and destroys the entire cosmic manifestation through the material energy, which is invested with the three modes of material nature. He, Lord Brahmä, is the shelter of those modes of nature—sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa.",

The original creator is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa (janmädy asya yataù ); Lord Brahmä is the secondary creator. When Lord Brahmä is empowered by Lord Kåñëa as the engineer to create the phenomenal world, he becomes the supremely powerful feature within this universe. The total material energy is created by Kåñëa, and later, taking advantage of all that has necessarily been created, Lord Brahmä engineers the entire phenomenal universe. At the end of Lord Brahmä's day, everything up to Svargaloka is inundated with water, and the next morning, when there is darkness in the universe, Brahmä again brings the phenomenal manifestation into existence. Therefore he is described here as he who manifests this universe."

Çréla Madhväcärya comments in this connection that tri-våtä means prakåtyä. Thus Lord Kåñëa is the original creator, and Lord Brahmä is the original engineer."
