When great yogés are in samädhi, even when their bodies are buried and their skin, marrow, blood and so on have all been eaten, if only their bones remain they can exist in a transcendental position. Very recently an archaeologist published findings indicating that Lord Christ, after being buried, was exhumed and that he then went to Kashmir. There have been many actual examples of yogés' being buried in trance and exhumed alive and in good condition several hours later. A yogé can keep himself alive in a transcendental state even if buried not only for many days but for many years."
