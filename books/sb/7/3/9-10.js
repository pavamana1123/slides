    "translation": "\"The supreme person within this universe, Lord Brahmä, has gotten his exalted post by dint of severe austerities, mystic power and trance. Consequently, after creating the universe, he has become the most worshipable demigod within it. Since I am eternal and time is eternal, I shall endeavor for such austerity, mystic power and trance for many, many births, and thus I shall occupy the same post occupied by Lord Brahmä.",

As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä , sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaëo viduù: one thousand yugas equals one day of Brahmä. The duration of Brahmä's life is extremely great, and consequently it was impossible for Hiraëyakaçipu to occupy that post. Nonetheless, his decision was that since the self (ätmä) and time are both eternal, if he could not occupy that post in one lifetime he would continue to execute austerities life after life so that sometime he would be able to do so."
