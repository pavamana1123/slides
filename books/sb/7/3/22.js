Thus he enlivened Hiraëyakaçipu.",

Tene brahma hådä ya ädi-kavaye:  the ädi deva, or ädi-kavi—the first living creature—was personally taught by the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the heart. There was no one to teach him, but since the Lord is situated within Brahmä's heart, Brahmä was educated by the Lord Himself. Lord Brahmä, being especially empowered, is infallible in doing whatever he wants. This is the meaning of the word amogha rädhasä. He desired to restore Hiraëyakaçipu's original body, and therefore, by sprinkling transcendental water from his waterpot, he immediately did so."
