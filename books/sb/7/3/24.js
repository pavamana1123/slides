The process of watering a tree is to pour water on the root. Similarly, the process of rendering service to different parts of the body is to supply food to the stomach. The demigods are, so to speak, different officers and directors in the government of the Supreme Lord. One has to follow the laws made by the government, not by the officers or directors. Similarly, everyone is to offer his worship to the Supreme Lord only. That will automatically satisfy the different officers and directors of the Lord. The officers and directors are engaged as representatives of the government, and to offer some bribe to the officers and directors is illegal. This is stated in Bhagavad-gétä as avidhi-pürvakam. In other words, Kåñëa does not approve the unnecessary worship of the demigods."

            "content": "In Bhagavad-gétä it is clearly stated that there are many types of yajïa performances recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant for satisfying the Supreme Lord. Yajïa means Viñëu. In the Third Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä it is clearly stated that one should work only for satisfying Yajïa, or Viñëu. The perfectional form of human civilization, known as varëäçrama-dharma, is specifically meant for satisfying Viñëu. Therefore, Kåñëa says, \"I am the enjoyer of all sacrifices because I am the supreme master.\" However, less intelligent persons, without knowing this fact, worship demigods for temporary benefit. Therefore they fall down to material existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has any material desire to be fulfilled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord (although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired result."

            "content": "Although Hiraëyakaçipu offered his obeisances unto Lord Brahmä, he was strongly inimical toward Lord Viñëu. This is the symptom of an asura. Asuras worship the demigods as being separate from the Lord, not knowing that all the demigods are powerful because of being servants of the Lord. If the Supreme Lord were to withdraw the powers of the demigods, the demigods would no longer be able to offer benedictions to their worshipers. The difference between a devotee and a nondevotee, or asura, is that a devotee knows that Lord Viñëu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that everyone derives power from Him. Without worshiping the demigods for particular powers, a devotee worships Lord Viñëu, knowing that if he desires a particular power he can get that power while acting as Lord Viñëu's devotee. Therefore in the çästra  it is recommended:"
