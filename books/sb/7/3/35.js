Now, however, having come to understand that even Lord Brahmä is not immortal because at the end of the millennium Lord Brahmä will also die, Hiraëyakaçipu is very carefully asking him for benedictions that will be almost as good as immortality. His first proposal is that he not be killed by any of the different forms of living entities created by Lord Brahmä within this material world."
