            "content": "Hiraëyakaçipu was very much afraid of Viñëu's becoming an animal to kill him because his brother had been killed by Viñëu when the Lord took the shape of a boar. He was therefore very careful to guard against all kinds of animals. But even without taking the shape of an animal, Viñëu could kill him by hurling His Sudarçana cakra, which can go anywhere without the Lord's physical presence. Therefore Hiraëyakaçipu was careful to guard against all kinds of weapons. He guarded against all kinds of time, space and countries because he was afraid of being killed by someone else in another land. There are many other planets, higher and lower, and therefore he prayed for the benediction of not being killed by any resident of any of these planets. There are three original deities—Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara. Hiraëyakaçipu knew that Brahmä would not kill him, but he also wanted not to be killed by Lord Viñëu or Lord Çiva. Consequently, he prayed for such a benediction. Thus Hiraëyakaçipu thought himself securely protected from any kind of death caused by any living entity within this universe. He also carefully guarded against natural death, which might take place within his house or outside of the house."
