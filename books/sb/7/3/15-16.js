    "translation": "Lord Brahmä, who is carried by a swan airplane, at first could not see where Hiraëyakaçipu was, for Hiraëyakaçipu's body was covered by an anthill and by grass and bamboo sticks. Because Hiraëyakaçipu had been there for a long time, the ants had devoured his skin, fat, flesh and blood. Then Lord Brahmä and the demigods spotted him, resembling a cloud—covered sun, heating all the world by his austerity. Struck with wonder, Lord Brahmä began to smile and then addressed him as follows.",

Hiraëyakaçipu performed a severe type of tapasya, austerity, for many long years. Indeed, it is said that he performed the tapasya for one hundred heavenly years. Since one day of the demigods equals six of our months, certainly this was a very long time. By nature's own way, his body had been almost consumed by earthworms, ants and other parasites, and therefore even Brahmä was at first unable to see him. Later, however, Brahmä could ascertain where Hiraëyakaçipu was, and Brahmä was struck with wonder to see Hiraëyakaçipu's extraordinary power to execute tapasya. Anyone would conclude that Hiraëyakaçipu was dead because his body was covered in so many ways, but Lord Brahmä, the supreme living being in this universe, could understand that Hiraëyakaçipu was alive but covered by material elements."

            "content": "It is also to be noted that although Hiraëyakaçipu performed this austerity for a long, long time, he was nonetheless known as a Daitya and Räkñasa. It will be seen from verses to follow that even great saintly persons could not perform such a severe type of austerity. Why then was he called a Räkñasa and Daitya? It is because whatever he did was for his own sense gratification. His son Prahläda Mahäräja was only five years old, and so what could Prahläda do? Yet simply by performing a little devotional service according to the instructions of Närada Muni, Prahläda became so dear to the Lord that the Lord came to save him, whereas Hiraëyakaçipu, in spite of all his austerities, was killed. This is the difference between devotional service and all other methods of perfection. One who performs severe austerities for sense gratification is fearful to the entire world, whereas a devotee who performs even a slight amount of devotional service is a friend to everyone (suhådaà sarva-bhütänäm , indicating that a devotee is freed from all material designations, and anyäbhiläñitä-çünyam [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11], situated in a transcendental position, free from all material desires."
