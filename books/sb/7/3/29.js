    "translation": "Your Lordship, being the origin of the life of this material world, is the master and controller of the living entities, both moving and stationary, and you inspire their consciousness. You maintain the mind and the acting and knowledge-acquiring senses, and therefore you are the great controller of all the material elements and their qualities, and you are the controller of all desires.",

Kåñëa is the supreme living entity (nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13)), and Brahmä is also a living entity, but the original source of Brahmä is Kåñëa. Therefore Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä , mattaù parataraà nänyat kiïcid asti dhanaïjaya: \"O Arjuna, there is no truth superior to Me.\" Kåñëa is the original source of Brahmä, who is the original source of this universe. Brahmä is a representative of Kåñëa, and therefore all the qualities and activities of Kåñëa are also present in Lord Brahmä."
