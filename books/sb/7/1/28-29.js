    "translation": "A grassworm confined in a hole of a wall by a bee always thinks of the bee in fear and enmity and later becomes a bee simply because of such remembrance. Similarly, if the conditioned souls somehow or other think of Kåñëa, who is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1), they will become free from their sins. Whether thinking of Him as their worshipable Lord or an enemy, because of constantly thinking of Him they will regain their spiritual bodies.",

A devotee, of course, by his knowledge and tapasya, becomes free from fear and anger and becomes a pure devotee. Similarly, an enemy, although thinking of Kåñëa inimically, thinks of Him constantly and also becomes purified. This is confirmed elsewhere in Bhagavad-gétä , where the Lord says:"

            "content": "\"Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he engages in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated.\" A devotee undoubtedly worships the Lord with rapt attention. Similarly, if an enemy (suduräcäraù) always thinks of Kåñëa, he also becomes a purified devotee. The example given here concerns the grassworm that becomes beelike because of constantly thinking of the bee that forces it to enter a hole. By always thinking of the bee in fear, the grassworm starts to become a bee. This is a practical example. Lord Kåñëa appears within this material world for two purposes—pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm:  to protect the devotees and annihilate the demons. The sädhus and devotees certainly think of the Lord always, but duñkåtés, the demons like Kaàsa and Çiçupäla, also think of Kåñëa in terms of killing Him. By thinking of Kåñëa, both the demons and devotees attain liberation from the clutches of material mäyä."

Thinking of Kåñëa, hearing the holy name of Kåñëa or hearing the pastimes of Kåñëa will make one pure, and then he will become a devotee. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore trying to introduce the system of somehow or other letting everyone hear the holy name of Kåñëa and take Kåñëa's prasäda. Thus one will gradually become a devotee, and his life will be successful."
