They became first cousins of Lord Kåñëa and were practically on an equal footing with Him. By personally killing them with His own disc, Lord Kåñëa destroyed whatever sinful reactions were left in them because of the curse of the brähmaëas. Närada Muni explained to Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira that by entering Kåñëa's body, Çiçupäla reentered Vaikuëöhaloka as the Lord's associate. Everyone had seen this incident."
