    "translation": "When the Supreme Personality of Godhead creates different types of bodies, offering a particular body to each living entity according to his character and fruitive actions, the Lord revives all the qualities of material nature—sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa. Then, as the Supersoul, He enters each body and influences the qualities of creation, maintenance and annihilation, using sattva-guëa for maintenance, rajo-guëa for creation and tamo-guëa for annihilation.",

            "content": "\"This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunté, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.\" The different changes in the material world take place as actions and reactions of the three guëas, but above the three guëas is their director, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the various types of bodies given to the living entities by material nature (yanträrüòhäni mäyayä), either sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa or tamo-guëa is prominent. The body is produced by material nature according to the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore it is said here, yadä sisåkñuù pura ätmanaù paraù, indicating that the body is certainly created by the Lord. Karmaëä daiva-netreëa:  according to the karma of the living entity, a body is prepared under the Supreme Lord's supervision. Whether the body is of sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa or tamo-guëa, everything is done by the direction of the Supreme Lord through the agency of the external energy (påthak sva-mäyayä). In this way, in different types of bodies, the Lord (éçvara) gives directions as Paramätmä, and again, to destroy the body, He employs the tamo-guëa. This is the way the living entities receive different types of bodies."
