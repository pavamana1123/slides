    "translation": "Somehow or other, one must consider the form of Kåñëa very seriously. Then, by one of the five different processes mentioned above, one can return home, back to Godhead. Atheists like King Vena, however, being unable to think of Kåñëa's form in any of these five ways, cannot attain salvation. Therefore, one must somehow think of Kåñëa, whether in a friendly way or inimically.",

            "content": "Impersonalists and atheists always try to circumvent the form of Kåñëa. Great politicians and philosophers of the modern age even try to banish Kåñëa from Bhagavad-gétä. Consequently, for them there is no salvation. But Kåñëa's enemies think, \"Here is Kåñëa, my enemy. I have to kill Him.\" They think of Kåñëa in His actual form, and thus they attain salvation. Devotees, therefore, who constantly think of Kåñëa's form, are certainly liberated. The only business of the Mäyävädé atheists is to make Kåñëa formless, and consequently, because of this severe offense at the lotus feet of Kåñëa, they cannot expect salvation. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says in this connection: tena çiçupälädi-bhinnaù pratiküla-bhävaà didhéñur yena iva narakaà yätéti bhävaù. Except for Çiçupäla, those who go against the regulative principles cannot attain salvation and are surely destined for hellish life. The regulative principle is that one must always think of Kåñëa, whether as a friend or enemy."
