Therefore Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira inquired from him, saying, etad äkhyätum arhasi: \"only you can explain the reason.\" From authoritative sources it can be discerned that associates of Lord Viñëu who descend from Vaikuëöha do not actually fall. They come with the purpose of fulfilling the desire of the Lord, and their descent to this material world is comparable to that of the Lord. The Lord comes to this material world through the agency of His internal potency, and similarly, when a devotee or associate of the Lord descends to this material world, he does so through the action of the spiritual energy. Any pastime conducted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is an arrangement by yogamäyä, not mahämäyä. Therefore it is to be understood that when Jaya and Vijaya descended to this material world, they came because there was something to be done for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Otherwise it is a fact that no one falls from Vaikuëöha."

Even though they rise to the highest point of liberation by dint of severe penances and austerities, they are sure to fall down again into material existence, for they do not take shelter at Your lotus feet.\" The impersonalists cannot reach the Vaikuëöha planets to become associates of the Lord, and therefore, according to their desires, Kåñëa gives them säyujya-mukti. However, since säyujya-mukti is partial mukti, they must fall again to this material world. When it is said that the individual soul falls from Brahmaloka, this applies to the impersonalist."

The Lord also sometimes wants to fight, but who can fight with the Lord but a very confidential devotee of the Lord? Jaya and Vijaya descended to this world to fulfill the Lord's desire. Therefore in each of their three births—first as Hiraëyäkña and Hiraëyakaçipu, second as Rävaëa and Kumbhakarëa, and third as Çiçupäla and Dantavakra—the Lord personally killed them. In other words, these associates of the Lord, Jaya and Vijaya, descended to the material world to serve the Lord by fulfilling His desire to fight. Otherwise, as Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira says, açraddheya iväbhäti: the statement that a servant of the Lord could fall from Vaikuëöha seems unbelievable. How Jaya and Vijaya came to this material world is explained by Närada Muni as follows."
