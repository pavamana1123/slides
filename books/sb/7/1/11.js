    "translation": "O great King, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the controller of the material and spiritual energies, who is certainly the creator of the entire cosmos, creates the time factor to allow the material energy and the living entity to act within the limits of time. Thus the Supreme Personality is never under the time factor nor under the material energy.",

He actually creates the situation by which material nature acts and by which the conditioned soul is placed under material nature. Both the conditioned soul and the material nature act within the time factor, but the Lord is not subject to the actions and reactions of time, for time has been created by Him. To be more clear, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says that creation, maintenance and annihilation are all under the supreme will of the Lord."

In this verse the words kälaà carantaà såjatéça äçrayam indicate that although the Lord acts within time, whether sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa or tamo-guëa is prominent, one should not think that the Lord is under time's control. Time is within His control, for He creates time to act in a certain way; He is not working under the control of time. The creation of the material world is one of the Lord's pastimes. Everything is fully under His control. Since creation takes place when rajo-guëa is prominent, the Lord creates the necessary time to give facilities for rajo-guëa. Similarly, He also creates the necessary times for maintenance and annihilation. Thus this verse establishes that the Lord is not under the limitations of time."

As the Lord confirms in Bhagavad-gétä , mattaù parataraà nänyat kiïcid asti dhanaïjaya: \"O conqueror of wealth [Arjuna], there is no truth superior to Me.\" Nothing can be above Kåñëa, for He is the controller and creator of everything."

But this is not correct. Here it is said, satya-kåt: whatever is created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, satyaà param, cannot be called mithyä. The cause of the creation is satya, true, so how can the effect of the cause be mithyä? The very word satya-kåt is used to establish that everything created by the Lord is factual, never false. The creation may be temporary, but it is not false."
