How, then, did He become partial like a common man for the sake of Indra and thus kill Indra's enemies? How can a person equal to everyone be partial to some and inimical toward others?",

No one is dear to Me, nor is anyone My enemy.\" In the previous canto, however, it has been observed that the Lord sided with Indra by killing the demons on his account (hata-puträ ditiù çakra-pärñëi-gräheëa viñëunä). Therefore, the Lord was clearly partial to Indra, although He is the Supersoul in everyone's heart. The soul is extremely dear to everyone, and similarly the Supersoul is also dear to everyone. Thus there cannot be any faulty action on the part of the Supersoul. The Lord is always kind to all living entities, irrespective of form and situation, yet He took the side of Indra just like an ordinary friend. This was the subject of Parékñit Mahäräja's inquiry. As a devotee of Lord Kåñëa, he knew very well that Kåñëa cannot be partial to anyone, but when he saw that Kåñëa acted as the enemy of the demons, he was somewhat doubtful. Therefore he posed this question to Çukadeva Gosvämé for a clear answer."

Mahäräja Parékñit knew perfectly well that Lord Viñëu, being transcendental, has nothing to do with material qualities, but to confirm his conviction he wanted to hear from the authority Çukadeva Gosvämé. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says, samasya kathaà vaiñamyam: since the Lord is equally disposed toward everyone, how can He be partial? Priyasya katham asureñu préty-abhävaù. The Lord, being the Supersoul, is extremely dear to everyone. Why, then, should the Lord display unsympathetic behavior toward the asuras? How is this impartial? Suhådaç ca kathaà teñv asauhärdam. Since the Lord says that He is suhådaà sarva-bhütänäm , the well-wisher of all living entities, how could He act with partiality by killing demons? These questions arose in the heart of Parékñit Mahäräja, and therefore he inquired from Çukadeva Gosvämé."
