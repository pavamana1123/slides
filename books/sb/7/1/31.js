Thus it is described here that the gopés, by their lusty desires, which were based upon their intense love for Kåñëa, became the most beloved devotees of the Lord. Although the gopés at Våndävana expressed their lusty desires in relationship with a paramour (parakéya-rasa), they actually had no lusty desires. This is significant of spiritual advancement. Their desires appeared lusty, but actually they were not the lusty desires of the material world. Caitanya-caritämåta compares the desires of the spiritual and material world to gold and iron. Both gold and iron are metal, but there is a vast difference in their value. The lusty desires of the gopés for Kåñëa are compared to gold, and material lusty desires are compared to iron."

Kåñëa's devotees attain the association of the Lord as His constant companions, either in Våndävana or in the Vaikuëöha planets. Similarly, although Närada Muni wanders in the three worlds, he has exalted devotion for Näräyaëa (aiçvaryamän). The Våñëis and Yadus and the father and mother of Kåñëa in Våndävana all have familial relationships with Kåñëa; Kåñëa's foster father and mother in Våndävana, however, are more exalted than Vasudeva and Devaké."
