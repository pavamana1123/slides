    "translation": "The great sage Çukadeva Gosvämé said: My dear King, you have put before me an excellent question. Discourses concerning the activities of the Lord, in which the glories of His devotees are also found, are extremely pleasing to devotees. Such wonderful topics always counteract the miseries of the materialistic way of life. Therefore great sages like Närada always speak upon Çrémad-Bhägavatam because it gives one the facility to hear and chant about the wonderful activities of the Lord. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto Çréla Vyäsadeva and then begin describing topics concerning the activities of Lord Hari.",

One must first offer one's respectful obeisances to one's spiritual master. Çukadeva Gosvämé's spiritual master is his father, Vyäsadeva, and therefore he first offers his respectful obeisances to Kåñëa Dvaipäyana Vyäsa and then begins describing topics of Lord Hari."

That is the only occupation of a Kåñëa conscious person."
