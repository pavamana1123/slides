    "translation": "When the quality of goodness is prominent, the sages and demigods flourish with the help of that quality, with which they are infused and surcharged by the Supreme Lord. Similarly, when the mode of passion is prominent the demons flourish, and when ignorance is prominent the Yakñas and Räkñasas flourish. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is present in everyone's heart, fostering the reactions of sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa.",

The conditioned soul is under the influence of the various modes of material nature, and behind material nature is the Supreme Personality of Godhead; but one's victory and loss under the influence of sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa are reactions of these modes, not of the Supreme Lord's partiality. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, in the Bhägavata-sandarbha, has clearly said:"

This same characteristic is also present in the living being, but because he is conditioned by material nature, even the pleasure potency of the Lord is manifested in the conditioned soul as troublesome. In the material world the pleasure enjoyed by the conditioned soul is followed by many painful conditions. For instance, we have seen that in the two great wars, which were conducted by the rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa, both parties were actually ruined. The German people declared war against the English to ruin them, but the result was that both parties were ruined. Although the Allies were apparently victorious, at least on paper, actually neither of them were victorious. Therefore it should be concluded that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not partial to anyone. Everyone works under the influence of various modes of material nature, and when the various modes are prominent, the demigods or demons appear victorious under the influence of these modes."

Generally the demigods are surcharged with sattva-guëa, and therefore when the demons and the demigods fight, the demigods are victorious because of the prominence of their sattva-guëa qualities. However, this is not the partiality of the Supreme Lord."
