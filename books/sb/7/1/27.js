Indeed, he thinks himself deficient in the inspiration of being feelingly absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness. This does not mean, however, that the enemies of Kåñëa are more elevated than Kåñëa's pure devotees. In the Caitanya-caritämåta  Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja Gosvämé also thinks of himself in such a humble way:"

            "content": "\"I am a worse sinner than Jagäi and Mädhäi and am even lower than the worms in the stool.\" A pure devotee always thinks himself more deficient than everyone else. If a devotee approaches Çrématé Rädhäräëé to offer some service to Kåñëa, even Çrématé Rädhäräëé thinks that the devotee is greater than She. Thus Närada Muni says that according to his opinion the enemies of Kåñëa are better situated because they are fully absorbed in thoughts of Kåñëa in terms of killing Him, just as a very lusty man always thinks of women and their association."

            "content": "The essential point in this connection is that one should be fully absorbed in thoughts of Kåñëa, twenty-four hours a day. There are many devotees in räga-märga, which is exhibited in Våndävana. Whether in däsya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vätsalya-rasa or mädhurya-rasa, all the devotees of Kåñëa are always overwhelmed by thoughts of Kåñëa. When Kåñëa is away from Våndävana tending the cows in the forest, the gopés, in the mädhurya-rasa, are always absorbed in thoughts of how Kåñëa walks in the forest. The soles of His feet are so soft that the gopés would not dare keep His lotus feet on their soft breasts. Indeed, they consider their breasts a very hard place for the lotus feet of Kåñëa, yet those lotus feet wander in the forest, which is full of thorny plants. The gopés are absorbed in such thoughts at home, although Kåñëa is away from them. Similarly, when Kåñëa plays with His young friends, mother Yaçodä is very much disturbed by thoughts that Kåñëa, because of always playing and not taking His food properly, must be getting weak. These are examples of the exalted ecstasy felt in Kåñëa's service as manifested in Våndävana. This service is indirectly praised by Närada Muni in this verse. Especially for the conditioned soul, Närada Muni recommends that one somehow or other be absorbed in thoughts of Kåñëa, for that will save one from all the dangers of material existence. Full absorption in thought of Kåñëa is the highest platform of bhakti-yoga."
