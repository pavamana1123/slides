There is no difference between Kåñëa's body and Näräyaëa's body. Therefore although they visibly entered the body of Kåñëa, they actually reentered Vaikuëöhaloka as the doorkeepers of Lord Viñëu. Through Lord Kåñëa's body, they returned to Vaikuëöha, although they seemed to have attained säyujya-mukti in Kåñëa's body."
