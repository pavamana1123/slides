Just as one can understand the supply of fire in wood, the water in a waterpot, or the sky within a pot, one can understand whether a living entity is a demon or a demigod by understanding that living entity's devotional performances. A thoughtful man can understand how much a person is favored by the Supreme Lord by seeing his actions.",

Therefore, how much a devotee has been favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be tested by the activities the devotee has performed. In Bhagavad-gétä  the Lord also says:"

A teacher instructs the student if the student is capable of taking more and more instructions. Otherwise, in spite of being instructed by the teacher, the student cannot make strides in his understanding. This has nothing to do with partiality. When Kåñëa says teñäà satata-yuktänäà bhajatäà préti-pürvakam/ dadämi buddhi-yogaà tam, this indicates that Kåñëa is prepared to give bhakti-yoga to everyone, but one must be capable of receiving it. That is the secret. Thus when a person exhibits wonderful devotional activities, a thoughtful man understands that Kåñëa has been more favorable to this devotee."

Such foolish persons become envious and try to minimize an advanced devotee's activities. That is not Vaiñëavism. A Vaiñëava should appreciate the service rendered to the Lord by other Vaiñëavas. Therefore a Vaiñëava is described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam as nirmatsara. Vaiñëavas are never envious of other Vaiñëavas or of anyone else, and therefore they are called nirmatsaräëäà satäm."

            "content": "As Bhagavad-gétä informs us, one can understand how one is saturated with sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa or tamo-guëa. In the examples given herewith, fire represents the mode of goodness. One can understand the constitution of a container for wood, petrol or other inflammable substances by the quantity of the fire. Similarly, water represents rajo-guëa, the mode of passion. A small skin and the vast Atlantic Ocean both contain water, and by seeing the quantity of water in a container one can understand the size of the container. The sky represents the mode of ignorance. The sky is present in a small earthen pot and also in outer space. Thus by proper judgment one can see who is a devatä, or demigod, and who is an asura, Yakña or Räkñasa according to the quantities of sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa. One cannot judge whether a person is a devatä, an asura or a Räkñasa by seeing him, but a sane man can understand this by the activities such a person performs. A general description is given in the Padma Puräëa: viñëu-bhaktaù småto daiva äsuras tad-viparyayaù. A devotee of Lord Viñëu is a demigod, whereas an asura or Yakña is just the opposite. An asura is not a devotee of Lord Viñëu; instead, for his sense gratification he is a devotee of the demigods, bhütas, pretas and so on. Thus one can judge who is a devatä, who is a Räkñasa and who is an asura by how they conduct their activities."

This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä  \"You are the Supreme Brahman, the supreme abode and purifier.\" Kåñëa is open to everyone, but one needs the capability to understand Him."

            "content": "By external features one cannot understand who is favored by Kåñëa and who is not. According to one's attitude, Kåñëa becomes one's direct adviser, or Kåñëa becomes unknown. This is not Kåñëa's partiality; it is His response to one's ability to understand Him. According to one's receptiveness—whether one be a devatä, asura, Yakña or Räkñasa—Kåñëa's quality is proportionately exhibited. This proportionate exhibition of Kåñëa's power is misunderstood by less intelligent men to be Kåñëa's partiality, but actually it is no such thing. Kåñëa is equal to everyone, and according to one's ability to receive the favor of Kåñëa, one advances in Kåñëa consciousness. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura gives a practical example in this connection. In the sky there are many luminaries. At night, even in darkness, the moon is extremely brilliant and can be directly perceived. The sun is also extremely brilliant. When covered by clouds, however, these luminaries are not distinctly visible. Similarly, the more one advances in sattva-guëa, the more his brilliance is exhibited by devotional service, but the more one is covered by rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa, the less visible his brilliance, for he is covered by these qualities. The visibility of one's qualities does not depend on the partiality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; it is due to various coverings in different proportions. Thus one can understand how far he has advanced in terms of sattva-guëa and how much he is covered by rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa."
