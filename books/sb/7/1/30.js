    "translation": "Many, many persons have attained liberation simply by thinking of Kåñëa with great attention and giving up sinful activities. This great attention may be due to lusty desires, inimical feelings, fear, affection or devotional service. I shall now explain how one receives Kåñëa's mercy simply by concentrating one's mind upon Him.",

            "content": "If a bona fide listener hears of Kåñëa's pastimes with the gopés, which seem to be lusty affairs, the lusty desires in his heart, which constitute the heart disease of the conditioned soul, will be vanquished, and he will become a most exalted devotee of the Lord. If one who hears of the gopés' lusty behavior with Kåñëa becomes free from lusty desires, certainly the gopés who approached Kåñëa became free from all such desires. Similarly, Çiçupäla and others who were very much envious of Kåñëa and who constantly thought of Kåñëa became free from envy. Nanda Mahäräja and mother Yaçodä were fully absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness because of affection. When the mind is somehow or other fully absorbed in Kåñëa, the material part is very soon vanquished, and the spiritual part—attraction to Kåñëa—becomes manifest. This indirectly confirms that if one thinks of Kåñëa enviously, simply because of thinking of Kåñëa he becomes free from all sinful reactions and thus becomes a pure devotee. Examples of this are given in the following verse."
