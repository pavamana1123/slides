Essentially, His inimical actions are not displays of enmity toward His so-called enemies, but in the material field one thinks that Kåñëa is favorable to devotees and unfavorable to nondevotees. When Kåñëa finally instructs in Bhagavad-gétä, sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja , this is meant not only for Arjuna but for every living entity within this universe."
