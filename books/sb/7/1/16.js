    "translation": "Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira inquired: It is very wonderful that the demon Çiçupäla merged into the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead even though extremely envious. This säyujya-mukti is impossible to attain even for great transcendentalists. How then did the enemy of the Lord attain it?",

Çiçupäla, however, was neither a jïäné nor a bhakta, yet simply by envy of the Lord he attained an exalted position by merging into the Lord's body. Certainly this was astonishing, and therefore Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira inquired about the cause for the Lord's mysterious mercy to Çiçupäla."
