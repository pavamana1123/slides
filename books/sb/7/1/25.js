    "translation": "Because of the bodily conception of life, the conditioned soul thinks that when the body is annihilated the living being is annihilated. Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the supreme controller, the Supersoul of all living entities. Because He has no material body, He has no false conception of \"I and mine.\" It is therefore incorrect to think that He feels pleasure or pain when blasphemed or offered prayers. This is impossible for Him. Thus He has no enemy and no friend. When He chastises the demons it is for their good, and when He accepts the prayers of the devotees it is for their good. He is affected neither by prayers nor by blasphemy.",

This is due to their bodily conception of life. Kåñëa has no such bodily conception, nor is His body different from His self. Therefore, since Kåñëa has no material conception of life, how can He be affected by material prayers and accusations? Kåñëa's body is described herewith as kaivalya, nondifferent from Himself. Since everyone has a material bodily conception of life, if Kåñëa had such a conception what would be the difference between Kåñëa and the conditioned soul? Kåñëa's instructions in Bhagavad-gétä are accepted as final because He does not possess a material body. As soon as one has a material body he has four deficiencies, but since Kåñëa does not possess a material body, He has no deficiencies. He is always spiritually conscious and blissful. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù (BS 5.1): His form is eternal, blissful knowledge. Sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù, änanda-cinmaya-rasa and kaivalya are the same."

Kñetra-jïaà cäpi mäà viddhi sama-kñetreñu bhärata: the Lord is the Paramätmä—the ätmä or Superself of all individual souls. Therefore it must naturally be concluded that He has no defective bodily conceptions. Although situated in everyone's body, He has no bodily conception of life. He is always free from such conceptions, and thus He cannot be affected by anything in relation to the material body of the jéva."

            "content": "\"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.\" Whenever the Lord punishes persons like demons, however, such punishment is meant for the good of the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul, being envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, may accuse Him, saying, \"Kåñëa is bad, Kåñëa is a thief\" and so on, but Kåñëa, being kind to all living entities, does not consider such accusations. Instead, He takes account of the conditioned soul's chanting of \"Kåñëa, Kåñëa\" so many times. He sometimes punishes such demons for one life by putting them in a lower species, but then, when they have stopped accusing Him, they are liberated in the next life because of chanting Kåñëa's name constantly. Blaspheming the Supreme Lord or His devotee is not at all good for the conditioned soul, but Kåñëa, being very kind, punishes the conditioned soul in one life for such sinful activities and then takes him back home, back to Godhead. The vivid example for this is Våträsura, who was formerly Citraketu Mahäräja, a great devotee. Because he derided Lord Çiva, the foremost of all devotees, he had to accept the body of a demon called Våtra, but then he was taken back to Godhead. Thus when Kåñëa punishes a demon or conditioned soul, He stops that soul's habit of blaspheming Him, and when the soul becomes completely pure, the Lord takes him back to Godhead."
