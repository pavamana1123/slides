This is not the regulative principle. Bhakti-yoga means änukülyena kåñëänuçélanam:  one should serve Kåñëa very favorably. This is the real injunction. Here it is said that although an enemy thinks of Kåñëa unfavorably, the Lord is unaffected by such antidevotional service. Thus He offers His benedictions even to Çiçupäla and similarly inimical conditioned souls. This does not mean, however, that one should be inimical toward the Lord. The stress is given to the favorable execution of devotional service, not purposeful blasphemy of the Lord. It is said:"

Jaya and Vijaya inwardly knew that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but they purposely became His enemies to be delivered from material life. From the very beginning of their lives they thought of Lord Kåñëa as an enemy, and even though blaspheming Lord Kåñëa, they chanted the holy name of Kåñëa constantly along with their inimical thoughts. Thus they were purified because of chanting the holy name of Kåñëa. It is to be understood that even a blasphemer can be freed from sinful activities by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Certainly, therefore, freedom is assured for a devotee who is always favorable to the service of the Lord. This will be clear from the following verse. By rapt attention fixed upon Kåñëa, one is purified, and thus one is delivered from material life."
