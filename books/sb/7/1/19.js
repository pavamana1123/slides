    "translation": "Although these two men—Çiçupäla and Dantavakra—repeatedly blasphemed the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viñëu [Kåñëa], the Supreme Brahman, they were quite healthy. Indeed, their tongues were not attacked by white leprosy, nor did they enter the darkest region of hellish life. We are certainly most surprised by this.",

Viñëuà yad brahma param avyayam. The Supreme Viñëu is Kåñëa. Kåñëa is the cause of Viñëu, not vice versa. Similarly, Brahman is not the cause of Kåñëa; Kåñëa is the cause of Brahman. Therefore Kåñëa is the Parabrahman (yad brahma param avyayam)."
