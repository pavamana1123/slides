For some time they remained merged, and later they received the liberations of särüpya and sälokya, living on the same planet as the Lord in the same bodily form. The çästras give evidence that if one blasphemes the Supreme Lord, his punishment is to remain in hellish life for many millions of years more than one suffers by killing many brähmaëas. Çiçupäla, however, instead of entering hellish life, immediately and very easily received säyujya-mukti. That such a privilege had been offered to Çiçupäla was not merely a story. Everyone saw it happen; there was no scarcity of evidence. How did it happen? Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was very much surprised."
