Playfully approaching the great sages gathered there, the boys grabbed hold of the sages' feet and impudently asked them with feigned humility, \"O learned brähmaëas, this black-eyed pregnant woman has something to ask you. She is too embarrassed to inquire for herself. She is just about to give birth and is very desirous of having a son. Since all of you are great sages with infallible vision, please tell us whether her child will be a boy or a girl.\"",

Similarly, although the präkåta-sahajiyäs think of themselves as intimate associates of Kåñëa, the supremely merciful Lord's determination is perfectly correct in working to finish such false devotees. Such impostors actually never accept real service to Kåñëa. The yadu-kumäras' deception is termed 'seemingly humble,' meaning that in fact they were anything but humble. Therefore, the ridiculing of Vaiñëavas by the Lord's family resulted in a great offense against the devotees of the Lord.\""

Unauthorized persons have initiated the process of deceitfully bestowing a woman's dress on their followers. This process is to be counted as a variety of aparädha, or offense against Kåñëa. Such an attempt to cheapen and ridicule devotional service to Kåñëa is certainly caused by envy toward the real Vaiñëavas, who are faithfully engaged in devotional service according to the rules and regulations of the Vedic literature.

Such an act amounts to cheating and ridicule of the devotees of Kåñëa. Sämba is a personal associate of the Lord, but acting as a harbinger of the future misfortune to be created in Kali-yuga by bogus followers of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, Sämba displayed this didactic pastime to help the living entities be blessed on the correct path of devotional service."

Because Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu understood that the great misfortune caused by such false yogés, or kuyogés, was impossible to forestall in the Kali-yuga, He infected them with insane desires for material objects of lust so that ordinary persons can easily identify such false yogés as deviated from the path of pure devotional service."
