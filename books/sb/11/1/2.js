    "translation": "Because the sons of Päëòu were enraged by the numerous offenses of their enemies, such as duplicitous gambling, verbal insults, the seizing of Draupadé's hair, and many other cruel transgressions, the Supreme Lord engaged those Päëòavas as the immediate cause to execute His will. On the pretext of the Battle of Kurukñetra, Lord Kåñëa arranged for all the kings who were burdening the earth to assemble with their armies on opposite sides of the battlefield, and when the Lord killed them through the agency of war, the earth was relieved of its burden.",

            "content": "The Päëòavas were repeatedly harassed by their enemies, such as Duryodhana and Duùçäsana. As innocent young princes, the Päëòavas had no enemy, but Duryodhana was constantly plotting against his helpless cousins. The Päëòavas were sent to a house of lac, which was later burned to the ground. They were administered poison, and their chaste wife Draupadé was publicly insulted when her hair was pulled and an attempt was made to strip her naked. Throughout these dangers, Lord Çré Kåñëa constantly protected the Päëòavas, who were fully surrendered to Him and who knew no shelter other than Him."

            "content": "In this verse the word itaretarataù is significant. Previous to the Battle of Kurukñetra, Kåñëa had personally killed many demons, including Pütanä, Keçé, Aghäsura and Kaàsa. Now, Kåñëa wanted to complete His mission of removing the earth's burden by killing the remaining impious persons. But as stated here, kåtvä nimittam: the Lord did not personally kill, but empowered His devotees Arjuna and the other Päëòavas to remove the impious kings. Thus acting personally and through His immediate expansion Balaräma, as well as by empowering His pure devotees such as the Päëòavas, Kåñëa fully displayed the pastimes of the yugävatära by reestablishing religious principles and ridding the world of demons. Although the general purpose of the Kurukñetra battle was to kill the demons, by Kåñëa's arrangement some great devotees such as Bhéñma also appeared to be inimical toward the Lord. But as described in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam  by the words hatä gatäù svarüpam, many great devotees played with the Lord as enemies and upon being killed by Kåñëa returned immediately to His abode in the spiritual sky in their original spiritual bodies. Because God is absolute, by His killing He simultaneously removes the demons from the earth and encourages His pure devotees."
