            "content": "Ordinary persons may be surprised or bewildered that the Lord gladly sanctioned the cursing and destruction of His own dynasty. The word anvamodata used here indicates taking pleasure in something, or giving sanction or approval. It is also mentioned, käla-rüpé: Kåñëa gladly gave His sanction to the brähmaëas' curse in the form of time. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Prabhupäda has commented that the Supreme Lord, Kåñëacandra, decided to maintain the curse intact in order to protect the actual principles of religion and destroy the unbecoming offense of the deceitful members of the Kärñëa dynasty. It is clearly explained in Bhagavad-gétä that the whole purpose of the Lord's descent into the material world is to reestablish the authentic principles of religion by which the conditioned souls who are suffering intensely under the laws of material nature can regain their original existential status as eternally liberated servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. The living entity comes to this material world with a desire to lord it over material nature, although the living entity is in fact not a lord but an eternal servant. Due to this perverted tendency to exploit the entire world for his sense gratification, the living entity is also prone to try to pervert the principles of spiritual life so that the eternal religious principles become appropriate to his own material sense gratification. Religion, however, is meant for pleasing the Supreme Lord by obeying His laws. And therefore Lord Kåñëa Himself personally comes from time to time to revive and enliven the correct method of devotional service to His lotus feet. In the Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is clearly stated that Lord Kåñëa had completed the vast majority of His pastimes on the earth and was now making the final arrangements for His departure. Therefore, He wished to leave behind a vivid lesson for the living entities of this age that any so-called religious person, even if he is so exalted as to take birth in the Lord's personal family, cannot violate the respect and reverence which is due to the pure devotees of the Lord, such as Närada Muni. The principle of serving the pure devotee of Kåñëa is so essential for spiritual advancement that the Lord exhibited the inconceivable pastime of causing the destruction of His entire dynasty just to impress this point upon the conditioned souls of Kali-yuga."

Such misfortunes also occurred after the disappearance of Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is accepted by Gauòéya Vaiñëavas as Kåñëa Himself. Through various instructions, the Bhägavatam provides for eliminating the cheating pseudoreligion that comes forth in human society after the departure of the Lord."

Thus He turned all of India toward the devotional service of Lord Kåñëa, so that due to the extensive preaching of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu and His followers there remained no topic of discussion in the world other than devotional service to the Supreme Lord. Tridaëòipäda Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté has elaborated on this in his verse stré-puträdi-kathäà jahur viñayiëaù."

These unauthorized persons present cheating in the guise of religion and advertise their duplicity as kathä, or pure worship of the Lord. Just as Kåñëa brought about a furious quarrel to destroy His own family, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu arranged for the world to be flooded by varieties of Mäyäväda and karma-väda philosophies just after His disappearance. He did this to destroy persons who belonged to the eleven apasampradäyas, or unauthorized disciplic traditions, as well as the many other apasampradäyas that would appear in the future and presume to call themselves devotees of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu or pretend to be descendants in His family line. At the same time, Caitanya Mahäprabhu arranged for His own men to be kept away from the pseudodevotion of these cheaters. The devotees of Lord Gaurasundara, Caitanya Mahäprabhu, can discern the mysteries of His pastimes that manifest in the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa. The activities of the transcendental body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be understood in any ordinary mundane way. That is the essential meaning of this chapter."
