    "translation": "Lord Kåñëa thought, \"No outside force could ever bring about the defeat of this family, the Yadu dynasty, whose members have always been fully surrendered to Me and are unrestricted in their opulence. But if I inspire a quarrel within the dynasty, that quarrel will act just like a fire created from the friction of bamboo in a grove, and then I shall achieve My real purpose and return to My eternal abode.\"",

            "content": "Even though Lord Kåñëa wanted to arrange for the disappearance of the members of the Yadu dynasty, He could not personally kill them, as He had killed many demons, because the Yadu dynasty was His own family. One might ask why Lord Kåñëa did not arrange for them to be killed by others. Therefore it is stated in this verse, naivänyataù paribhavo 'sya bhavet kathaïcit: because the Yadu dynasty was the Lord's own family, no one within the universe was capable of killing them, not even the demigods. In fact, Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out that no one within the universe was capable of even insulting the members of the Yadu dynasty, what to speak of defeating or killing them. The reason is given here by the words mat-saàçrayasya. The members of the Yadu dynasty had fully taken shelter of Kåñëa, and therefore they were always under the personal protection of the Lord. It is stated, märe kåñëa räkhe ke, räkhe kåñëa märe ke: If Kåñëa protects someone, no one can kill him, and if Kåñëa wants to kill someone, no one can save him. Kåñëa had originally requested all of His associates, along with the demigods, to appear on the earth to assist Him in His pastimes. Now that His pastimes were coming to an end on this particular planet and would be transferred to another planet in another universe, Kåñëa wanted to remove all of His associates from the earth so that in His absence they would not constitute a burden. Since the powerful Yadu dynasty, being the Lord's personal family and army, could not possibly be defeated by anyone, Kåñëa arranged an internal quarrel, just as the wind in a bamboo forest sometimes rubs the bamboos together and creates a fire that consumes the entire forest."

In other words, people polluted by Mäyäväda philosophy might see the Yadu dynasty as being on the same level as Kåñëa. Therefore, to establish that even the most powerful living entity can never equal or surpass the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa arranged for the destruction of the Yadu dynasty."
