He states that since the intentions of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëacandra, are always perfect, it was certainly in consideration of the greatest benefit for the entire world that He destroyed His own family on the pretext of a curse by brähmaëas. In this connection, Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has shown a parallel in the pastimes of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is Kåñëa Himself appearing as His own devotee."

All three personalities—Caitanya Mahäprabhu, Nityänanda Prabhu and Advaita Prabhu—are accepted by Vaiñëava äcäryas to be in the category of viñëu-tattva, the full status of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These three Personalities of Godhead perceived that in the future Their so-called seminal descendants would get undue recognition and thus, being puffed up, would commit grave offenses against those who were actually Vaiñëava gurus or representatives of the Lord."

No one is My enemy, and no one is My special friend.\" If the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears to have a special family, such as the Yadu dynasty, such a so-called family is a special arrangement of the Lord's pastimes in order to attract the conditioned souls. When Kåñëa descends, He acts as if He were an ordinary person in order to attract the living entities to His pastimes. Therefore Kåñëa acted as though the Yadu dynasty was His personal family, although in fact every living entity is a member of His family."

Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, therefore, avoided this impediment on the path of spiritual enlightenment by leaving behind no children. Although Caitanya Mahäprabhu married twice, He was childless. Nityänanda Prabhu, who is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead, did not accept any of the natural sons born of His own son, Çré Vérabhadra. Similarly, Lord Advaita Äcärya divested of His association all of His sons except Acyutänanda and two others. Acyutänanda, the chief faithful son of Advaita Äcärya, had no seminal progeny, and the remaining three of the six sons of Lord Advaita fell from the path of devotion to the Lord and are known as rejected sons. In other words, the appearance of Caitanya Mahäprabhu allowed little facility for continuing a so-called seminal family to create confusion. The respect shown to the conception of seminal lineage in deference to the ideas of the smärtas is unfit to be accepted by one who actually understands the supreme truth from Vedic authority."

            "content": "Other äcäryas, or spiritual masters, have also demonstrated this point in their own families. His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda, our own beloved spiritual master, who is the mighty author of this Çrémad-Bhägavatam series, was born in a family of pure devotees, and he himself exhibited all the symptoms of pure devotional service from his very childhood. Çréla Prabhupäda eventually came to the Western countries and exhibited unprecedented spiritual potency in establishing the Kåñëa consciousness movement all over the world. In a few short years, he translated more than fifty large volumes of Vedic philosophy. By his practical activities he is certainly understood to be a most empowered representative of the Lord. Nonetheless, his own family members, although devotees of Kåñëa, did not at all come up to the proper standard of devotional service and are therefore not given attention by the members of ISKCON. The natural tendency for the members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness would be to offer all reverence and worship to the members of Çréla Prabhupäda's immediate family. But since by Kåñëa's arrangement these family members are not at all on the platform of pure devotional service, the members of ISKCON give them hardly any attention but instead worship those who actually exhibit the qualities of highly advanced Vaiñëavas, regardless of their so-called birth. In other words, birth cannot constitute the qualification for a respectable person, even when one is born in the Lord's own family or in the äcärya's family, what to speak of an ordinary wealthy or learned family."

In this regard, Çréla Prabhupäda has written in The Nectar of Devotion, \"In the Middle Ages, after the disappearance of Lord Caitanya's great associate Lord Nityänanda, a class of priestly persons claimed to be the descendants of Nityänanda, calling themselves the gosvämé caste. They further claimed that the practice and spreading of devotional service belonged only to their particular class, which was known as nityänanda-vaàça. In this way they exercised their artificial power for some time, until Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the powerful äcärya of the Gauòéya Vaiñëava sampradäya, completely smashed their idea. There was a great hard struggle for some time, but it has turned out successful, and it is now correctly and practically established that devotional service is not restricted to a particular class of men. Besides that, anyone who is engaged in devotional service is already a high-class brähmaëa. So Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura's struggle for this movement has come out successful. It is on the basis of his position that anyone, from any part of the universe, can become a Gauòéya Vaiñëava.\""

Despite his past situation, any living being who is willing to surrender again at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord or His bona fide representative can purify himself by strictly adhering to the rules and regulations of bhakti-yoga and thus act as a high-class brähmaëa. Nonetheless, the seminal descendants of the Lord think themselves to have acquired their ancestor's character and position. Thus the Supreme Lord, who is the well-wisher of the entire universe and especially of His devotees, bewilders the discriminatory power of His own descendants in such a contradictory way that these seminal descendants become recognized as deviant and the actual qualification to be a representative of the Lord, namely unalloyed surrender to the will of Kåñëa, remains prominent."
