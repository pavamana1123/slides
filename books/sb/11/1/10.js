    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: The Lord, who bore His body as the amalgamation of everything beautiful, dutifully executed the most auspicious activities while on the earth, although He was, in fact, without any endeavor already satisfied in all desires. Residing in His abode and enjoying life, the Lord, whose glorification is in itself magnanimous, now wanted to annihilate His dynasty, as there still remained some small part of His duty to be carried out.",

By the words saàhartum aicchata kulam it is clearly stated that Lord Kåñëa Himself desired to withdraw His dynasty and therefore engaged the brähmaëas as His agent. Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura remarks here that Kåñëa had clearly demonstrated the insurpassable beauty and strength of His personal form, pastimes and pleasures to all the residents of the earth. Thus His incarnation to kill the demons, save the devotees and reestablish religious principles had been completely successful. When Lord Kåñëa noticed that His mission was now complete, everything having been done perfectly, He desired to return to His transcendental abode, along with the Våñëis. Thus the Lord personally arranged for the Yadu dynasty to be cursed by the brähmaëas."

He states that many so-called religious persons have fallen down by committing the second offense against chanting the holy name, namely viñëau sarveçvareçe tad-itara-sama-dhéù, considering another living entity to be equal to Lord Viñëu, who is the Lord of lords. One who is captured by the impersonal tendency of Mäyäväda philosophy falsely thinks that the external, material energy of the Lord is equal to His internal, spiritual potency. In this way, one equates ordinary living entities with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, taking Kåñëa to be another aspect of mäyä. This is a most unfortunate misconception, for it spoils one's opportunity to understand God as He actually is."

            "content": "Persons inclined toward this illusory conception of life would undoubtedly consider the members of the Yadu dynasty equal in all respects to Kåñëa and worship the future descendants of Kåñëa's family as being equal to Kåñëa Himself. Thus the continued presence of the Yadu dynasty on the earth would certainly constitute a great impediment on the path of spiritual understanding and a great burden on the earth. To counteract the danger to the world from the offense of equating Viñëu with the family of Viñëu, the Lord decided to crush the Yadu family."

            "content": "The Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, is always affectionate to His devotees, but whenever the familial descendants of Lord Kåñëa become inimical or indifferent to Him, not loving His pure devotees or making friendship with His servants, such so-called family members of the Lord become impediments to His will. There is a tangible danger that ignorant living beings will worship such inimical persons, revering them as close associates of Kåñëa. For example, to consider Kaàsa the maternal uncle of Kåñëa and therefore a faithful servant of Kåñëa would be a completely erroneous conclusion. By such a misconception, evil men who oppose the Lord may be accepted as His intimate associates, and persons inimical to Kåñëa may be thought of as His surrendered dependents appearing in His own family. The purpose of the destruction of the Yadu dynasty was to eradicate the false logic of the Mäyävädés who desire to see everything as one in all respects and who therefore improperly reason that the enemies of Kåñëa's devotees can be His intimate family members."
