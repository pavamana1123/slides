    "translation": "The sages Viçvämitra, Asita, Kaëva, Durväsä, Bhågu, Aìgirä, Kaçyapa, Vämadeva, Atri and Vasiñöha, along with Närada and others, once performed fruitive rituals that award abundant pious results, bring great happiness and take away the sins of Kali-yuga for the whole world by merely being recounted. The sages duly executed these rituals in the home of the chief of the Yadus, Vasudeva, the father of Lord Kåñëa. After Lord Kåñëa, who was staying in Vasudeva's house as time personified, respectfully sent the sages off at the conclusion of the ceremonies, they went to the holy place called Piëòäraka.",

            "content": "In this verse, Çukadeva Gosvämé begins to narrate the story of the brahminical curse that arose against the Yadu dynasty by the Lord's desire. According to Çrédhara Svämé, certain religious rituals, such as the açvamedha-yajïa, generate pious reactions. On the other hand, activities such as caring for one's children give immediate pleasure in the present only, whereas rituals performed as atonement take away sinful reactions. But the religious activities mentioned in verse 11, which are indicated by the words karmäëi puëya-nivahäni su-maìgaläni gäyaj-jagat-kali-maläpaharäëi, were pious in all respects. They produced abundant pious results and great joy and were so potent that merely glorifying these rituals relieves one from all the sinful reactions of Kali-yuga."

In the Eleventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä the Supreme Personality of Godhead reveals Himself to Arjuna as time personified, appearing on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra to destroy all the kings and armies who constitute a burden to the earth. Similarly, kälätmanä nivasatä yadu-deva-gehe: Kåñëa was staying in the home of His father Vasudeva as time personified, thus indicating that the time was approaching for the destruction of His own dynasty according to His desire."
