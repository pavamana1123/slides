The Våñëis, however, were not like that, and thus they are described here by King Parékñit as brahmaëyänäm, or sincere followers of brahminical culture. Further, even if the brähmaëas became angry, why would they curse members of Kåñëa's own family? Since the brähmaëas were well learned, they must have known that it is offensive to oppose personal associates of the Supreme Lord. The Yadu dynasty is specifically described here as våñnénäm and kåñëa-cetasäm. In other words, they were Lord Kåñëa's own men, and they were always absorbed in thinking of Kåñëa. Therefore, even if somehow or other the brähmaëas had cursed them, how could that curse have had any effect?"

The Supreme Lord desired to remove His personal dynasty from the earth, and therefore uncustomary offensive behavior was exhibited by the young boys of Kåñëa's own family."

Contempt and ridicule directed toward respectable persons and true brähmaëas vanquish all good qualities. If there is a break in etiquette toward His devotees, the Supreme Lord will become ill-disposed even to His own relatives and friends and thus arrange to destroy those who oppose His devotees. If foolish persons in the guise of members of Kåñëa's personal family express enmity toward Vaiñëavas, such offenders cannot properly be called offspring of Lord Kåñëa's dynasty. That is the supreme equality of the Personality of Godhead."
