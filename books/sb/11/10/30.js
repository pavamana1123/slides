Even in the heavenly planets there is no relief from the miseries of material life. No conditioned soul can live eternally, as clearly demonstrated by the deaths of Hiraëyakaçipu and other demons. Since even the demigods fear the time potency of the Personality of Godhead, one may easily conclude that Kåñëa is the Absolute Truth and that He is eternally the supreme controller of everything and everyone. Lord Kåñëa is the only real shelter."
