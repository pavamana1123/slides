Now the Lord describes the practical means for achieving such a saintly position. In the Païcarätra and other scriptures the Personality of Godhead gives instructions for executing devotional service. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä  the Lord says, cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù: \"I have personally created the varëäçrama system.\" There are innumerable rules and regulations in the varëäçrama system, and the devotee should execute those which do not contradict the process of devotional service. The term varëa indicates different classes of human beings, some in the mode of ignorance, some in the mode of passion and some in the mode of goodness. Devotional service to the Lord is executed on the liberated platform, and therefore some injunctions for those persons in passion and ignorance may be contradictory to the regulative principles for those on the liberated platform. Therefore, under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master who is nondifferent from the Lord, one should execute the basic principles of varëäçrama in a way favorable for advancement in Kåñëa consciousness."
