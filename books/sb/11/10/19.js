The scientists are busily working to solve this problem, but since they have completely failed, it is understood that they are not actually intelligent and that they do not know the means of achieving happiness and eliminating misery. It is most foolish to think that one can be happy with an ax hanging over one's neck. Lord Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä, måtyuù sarva-haraç cäham:  \"I Myself come before you as death and take everything away.\" We should not blindly ignore the disaster of material life, but should instead accept the Lord's causeless mercy, which He so magnanimously offers in His incarnation as Caitanya Mahäprabhu,. We should surrender to the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya, who offers the real means for achieving unqualified happiness: the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. This is the Lord's desire, and it is in our own self-interest to take up this process."
