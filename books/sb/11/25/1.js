            "content": "The word asammiçra indicates that which is not mixed with anything else. Lord Kåñëa now explains how each of the three material modes (goodness, passion and ignorance), acting separately, causes a conditioned soul to manifest a particular type of existence. The living entity is ultimately transcendental to the modes of nature, being part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa, but in conditioned life he manifests material qualities. This is described in the following verses."
