Lord Kåñëa has elaborately described in this chapter the characteristics of the three modes of nature and the transcendental situation of Kåñëa consciousness. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has ordered us to take shelter of the holy name of Lord Kåñëa, by which process we can easily transcend the modes of nature and begin our real life of loving devotional service to Lord Kåñëa."
