A brahmacäré who practices celibacy perfectly in some particular stage of his life achieves Maharloka, and one who perfectly practices lifelong celibacy achieves Janaloka. By perfect execution of vänaprastha one may achieve Tapoloka, and one in the renounced order of life goes to Satyaloka. These different destinations certainly depend on one's seriousness in the yoga system. In the Third Canto of the Bhägavatam, Lord Brahmä explains to the demigods, \"The inhabitants of Vaikuëöha travel in their airplanes made of lapis lazuli, emeralds and gold. Although crowded by their consorts, who have large hips and beautiful smiling faces, they cannot be stimulated to passion by their mirth and beautiful charms.\" ,"
