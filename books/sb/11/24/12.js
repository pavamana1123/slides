The highest four planets, however, Satyaloka, Maharloka, Janaloka and Tapoloka, are meant for those who are most perfectly endeavoring for liberation. Caitanya Mahäprabhu is so inconceivably merciful that He is promoting the most fallen victims of Kali-yuga beyond these four planets and even beyond Vaikuëöha, to the supreme planet of Lord Kåñëa in the spiritual sky, called Goloka Våndävana. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains that heaven is the residence of the demigods, the earth is the residence of the human beings, and in between is a temporary residence for both classes of beings."
