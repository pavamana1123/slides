Lord Näräyaëa enters within the universe but does not give up His purely transcendental body of knowledge and bliss. Lord Brahmä, however, born from the Lord's navel lotus, has a material body. Although Lord Brahmä is the most powerful mystic, his body, which pervades all material existence, is material, whereas the body of the Supreme Lord Hari, Näräyaëa, is always transcendental."
