Their consciousness was intensely and intimately attached to Lord Kåñëa, and by such Kåñëa consciousness their own bodies seemed very far away from them, even though people normally consider their body to be their closest possession. In fact, the gopés did not think about their own existence. Although a young woman normally considers her husband and children to be her dearmost possessions, the gopés did not even consider the existence of their so-called families. Nor could they think of this world or life after death. Indeed, they were not at all aware of these things. Just like great sages who become detached from the names and forms of the material world, the gopés could not think of anything, because they were rapt in loving remembrance of Lord Kåñëa. Just as rivers enter the ocean, similarly, the gopés completely merged into consciousness of Lord Kåñëa through intense love.\""

The Kåñëa consciousness of the gopés is the perfection of spiritual life, and the symptoms of such perfection are described here."
