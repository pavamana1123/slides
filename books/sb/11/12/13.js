            "content": "The words asvarüpa-vidaù (\"not understanding My actual position or form\") indicate that the lovely gopés were so completely absorbed in conjugal love for Lord Kåñëa that they were not aware of the Lord's unlimited potencies as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains this and other meanings of the word asvarüpa-vidaù. In Sanskrit the word vid also means \"to acquire.\" Thus, asvarüpa-vidaù indicates that the gopés, like other pure devotees of the Lord, were not interested in achieving särüpya-mukti, the liberation of acquiring a bodily form similar to the Lord's. Were the gopés to obtain a bodily form like the Lord's, how could the Lord execute His conjugal pastimes of dancing with the gopés and embracing them? Since the gopés had realized their eternal spiritual forms as servitors of the Lord, the word svarüpa also may indicate their own spiritual bodies, and thus asvarüpa-vidaù means that the gopés never thought, as materialists do, of their own bodily beauty. Although the gopés are the most beautiful girls in the Lord's creation, they never thought of their own bodies but rather were always meditating on the transcendental body of Lord Kåñëa. Although we cannot imitate the gopé's exalted conjugal feelings, we can follow their superb example of practical Kåñëa consciousness. They naturally took shelter of Lord Kåñëa and achieved the highest perfection of life."
