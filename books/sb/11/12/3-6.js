    "translation": "In every yuga many living entities entangled in the modes of passion and ignorance gained the association of My devotees. Thus, such living entities as the Daityas, Räkñasas, birds, beasts, Gandharvas, Apsaräs, Nägas, Siddhas, Cäraëas, Guhyakas and Vidyädharas, as well as such lower-class human beings as the vaiçyas, çüdras, women and others, were able to achieve My supreme abode. Våträsura, Prahläda Mahäräja and others like them also achieved My abode by association with My devotees, as did personalities such as Våñaparvä, Bali Mahäräja, Bäëäsura, Maya, Vibhéñaëa, Sugréva, Hanumän, Jämbavän, Gajendra, Jaöäyu, Tulädhära, Dharma-vyädha, Kubjä, the gopés in Våndävana and the wives of the brähmaëas who were performing sacrifice.",

It is understood that devotees like the gopés and others mentioned here obtained pure love of Kåñëa, whereas the demons generally obtained only salvation. Many demons were purified by association with devotees and came to accept devotional service to the Lord as the most important among the various activities in their lives, but the exalted devotees like Prahläda and Bali Mahäräja know nothing except devotional service, which they accept as their very life. Still, the reformed demons are also mentioned so that readers of Çrémad-Bhägavatam will understand the enormous benefits one may achieve by associating with devotees of the Lord."

Prahläda Mahäräja, being the son of Hiraëyakaçipu, is considered a Daitya, or demon. Yet while still in the womb of his mother, Kayädhü, he associated with Närada Muni by sound vibration. The demon Våñaparvä was abandoned by his mother at birth, but he was raised by a muni and became a devotee of Lord Viñëu. Bali Mahäräja associated with his grandfather Prahläda and also with Lord Vämanadeva. Bali Mahäräja's son, Bäëäsura, was saved by association with his father and Lord Çiva. He also associated with Lord Kåñëa personally when the Lord cut off all but two of his one thousand arms, which had been awarded as a benediction by Lord Çiva. Understanding the glories of Lord Kåñëa, Bäëäsura also became a great devotee. The demon Maya Dänava constructed an assembly house for the Päëòavas and also associated with Lord Kåñëa Himself, eventually achieving the shelter of the Lord. Vibhéñaëa was a pious-natured demon, the brother of Rävaëa, and he associated with Hanumän and Rämacandra."

He personally associated with Lord Kåñëa, fighting with Him over the Syamantaka jewel. The elephant Gajendra in a previous life had association with devotees, and at the end of his life as Gajendra he was personally saved by the Lord. Jaöäyu, the bird who at the cost of his own life assisted Lord Rämacandra, associated with Çré Garuòa and Mahäräja Daçaratha as well as other devotees in räma-lélä. He also personally met with Sétä and Lord Räma. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the association that the Gandharvas, Apsaräs, Nägas, Siddhas, Cäraëas, Guhyakas and Vidyädharas had with the devotees is not very prominent and does not need to be mentioned. Vaëikpatha is a vaiçya, and his story is mentioned in the Mahäbhärata in connection with the pride of Jäjali Muni."

In a previous life he somehow became a brahma-räkñasa, or brähmaëa ghost, but was eventually saved. In a previous Kali-yuga he had the association of a Vaiñëava king named Väsu. The lady Kubjä associated directly with Lord Kåñëa, and in her previous birth she had associated with Çré Närada Muni The gopés of Våndävana rendered service to saintly persons in their previous births. Having had ample association with devotees, they became gopés in Våndävana in their next lives and associated with the eternally liberated gopés who had descended there. They also had association with Tulasé-devé, or Våndä-devé. The wives of the brähmaëas performing sacrifice had association with women sent by Lord Kåñëa to sell flower garlands and betel nuts and heard about the Lord from them."
