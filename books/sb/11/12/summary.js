Neither yoga, Säìkhya philosophy, ordinary religious duties, study of scriptures, austerities, renunciation, works of iñöä and pürtam, charity, vows of fasting, worship of the Deity, secret mantras, visiting of holy places, nor adherence to any major or minor regulative principles can effect the same result. In every age there are demons, monsters, birds and animals who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, and there are also human beings in the categories of businessmen, women, workers, outcastes, and so on, who cannot study the Vedic scriptures. Nevertheless, by the purifying effect of the association of devotees they may all achieve the supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, whereas without such saintly association, even those very seriously endeavoring in yoga, Säìkhya study, charity, vows and practice of the renounced order of life may remain incapable of attaining the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Yet by the power of their constant association with Çré Kåñëa, they attained to the supreme Absolute Truth, which even great demigods like Brahmä cannot achieve. The young women of Våndävana displayed such deep attachment to Lord Kåñëa that their minds, which were overflowing with the ecstasy of being with Him, perceived an entire night spent in His company as just a fraction of a second. However, when Akrüra took Çré Kåñëa along with Baladeva to Mathurä, the gopés then thought each night without Him to be equal in duration to a millennium of the demigods. Being tormented by separation from Lord Kåñëa, they could not imagine anything that could give them satisfaction other than His return. This is the incomparable excellence of the gopés' pure love of God."
