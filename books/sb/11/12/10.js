    "translation": "The residents of Våndävana, headed by the gopés, were always completely attached to Me with deepest love.

            "content": "This verse especially describes the sentiments of the cowherd girls of Våndävana, the gopés, and Lord Kåñëa here reveals the incomparable love they felt for Him. As explained in the Tenth Canto, Lord Kåñëa's uncle Akrüra, sent by Kaàsa, came to Våndävana and took Kåñëa and Balaräma back to Mathurä for a wrestling event. The gopés loved Lord Kåñëa so much that in His absence their consciousness was completely absorbed in spiritual love. Thus their Kåñëa consciousness is considered the highest perfectional stage of life. They were always expecting that Lord Kåñëa would finish His business of killing demons and return to them, and therefore their anxiety was an extremely moving, heartrending display of love. Anyone desiring true happiness must take to the devotional service of the Lord in the spirit of the gopés, giving up everything for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord."
