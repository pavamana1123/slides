As we have already explained, such procedures are secondary. But the inhabitants of Våndävana such as the gopés did not know anything except Lord Kåñëa, and their whole purpose in life was simply to love Lord Kåñëa, as indicated here by the words kevalena hi bhävena. Even the trees, bushes and hills such as Govardhana loved Lord Kåñëa. As the Lord explains to His brother, Çré Baladeva, in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

Although a living entity takes birth as a tree due to the mode of ignorance, certainly by such a birth in Våndävana these trees are destroying all darkness in their lives by serving Your lotus feet.\""

Therefore the Lord has not bothered to mention in this verse those who achieved perfection through mixed processes, but rather glorifies the unalloyed devotees of Våndävana, headed by the gopés, who knew nothing but Lord Kåñëa. The residents of Våndävana were so satisfied in their relationships with Lord Kåñëa that they did not pollute their loving service with mental speculation or fruitive desires. The gopés served Lord Kåñëa in the conjugal rasa, or relationship, whereas according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura the cows loved Lord Kåñëa in vätsalya-rasa, or the love of parents for a child, because the cows were always supplying milk to child Kåñëa. Unmoving objects like Govardhana Hill and other hills and mountains loved Lord Kåñëa as a friend, and the ordinary animals, trees and bushes of Våndävana loved Lord Kåñëa in däsya-rasa, or with love of a servant for his master. Snakes like Käliya also developed this love in servitude, and after relishing their loving service to Lord Kåñëa, all of them went back home, back to Godhead. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, all those inhabitants of Våndävana should be considered eternally liberated souls, as expressed by the word siddhäù, which means \"having achieved the perfection of life.\""
