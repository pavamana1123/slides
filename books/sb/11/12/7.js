In this verse, however, the Lord again explains that all such processes are secondary to the essential process of associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His pure devotees. By other processes one may gain the association of the Lord and His devotees, which will actually give the perfection of life. The word mat-saìgät can also be read as sat-saìgät, with the same meaning. In the reading mat-saìgät (\"from association with Me\"), mat is also understood to indicate \"those who are Mine,\" or the devotees. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé mentions that a pure devotee can advance in Kåñëa consciousness by his own association, since simply by associating with his own activities and consciousness, he associates with the Lord."
