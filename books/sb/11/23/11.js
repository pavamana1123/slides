            "content": "It appears that even though the so-called brähmaëa was determined not to spend his money, his wife and other relatives managed to squeeze out a portion. According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, providence here refers to fires in the home and other types of occasional misfortune. Effects of time here refers to the destruction of agricultural crops through seasonal irregularities and other such occurrences. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points out that one should not merely proclaim oneself to be a brähmaëa but should actually understand one's original identity as a servant of the Lord. One declaring himself to be a brähmaëa but maintaining a materialistic mentality is not a real brähmaëa, but rather a brahma-bandhu, or so-called brähmaëa. The humble devotees of Lord Viñëu, following the indications of the Vedic scriptures, refer to themselves as unfortunate and unable to understand the kingdom of God; they do not proudly proclaim themselves to be brähmaëas. Those who are wise, however, know that such humble devotees are actually brähmaëas whose hearts are cleansed by the pure mode of goodness."
