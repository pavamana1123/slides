            "content": "\"The word parätma-niñöhä means being a devotee of Lord Kåñëa. Parätmä, the Supreme Person, is Kåñëa. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù (BS 5.1). Those who are completely dedicated to the lotus feet of Kåñëa in service are actually sannyäsés. As a matter of formality, the devotee accepts the sannyäsa dress as previous äcäryas did. He also accepts the three daëòas. Later Viñëu Svämé considered that accepting the dress of a tri-daëòé was parätma-niñöhä. Therefore sincere devotees add another daëòa, the jéva-daëòa, to the three existing daëòas. The Vaiñëava sannyäsé is known as a tridaëòi-sannyäsé. The Mäyävädé sannyäsé accepts only one daëòa, not understanding the purpose of tri-daëòa. Later, many persons in the community of Çiva Svämé gave up the ätma-niñöhä (devotional service) of the Lord and followed the path of Çaìkaräcärya. Instead of accepting 108 names, those in the Çiva Svämé sampradäya follow the path of Çaìkaräcärya and accept the ten names of sannyäsa. Although Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu accepted the then-existing order of sannyäsa (namely eka-daëòa), He still recited a verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam about the tridaëòa-sannyäsa accepted by the brähmaëa of Avantépura. Indirectly He declared that within that ekadaëòa (one daëòa), four daëòas existed as one. Accepting ekadaëòa sannyäsa without parätma-niñöhä (devotional service to Lord Kåñëa) is not acceptable to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. In addition, according to the exact regulative principles, one should add the jéva-daëòa to the tri-daëòa. These four daëòas, bound together as one, are symbolic of unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. Because the ekadaëòi-sannyäsés of the Mäyäväda school are not devoted to the service of Kåñëa, they try to merge into the Brahman effulgence, which is a marginal position between material and spiritual existence. They accept this impersonal position as liberation. Mäyävädé sannyäsés, not knowing that Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu was a tri-daëòé, think of Caitanya Mahäprabhu as an ekadaëòi-sannyäsé. This is due to their vivarta, bewilderment. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam there is no such thing as an ekadaëòi-sannyäsé; indeed, the tridaëòi-sannyäsé is accepted as the symbolic representation of the sannyäsa order. By citing this verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu accepted the sannyäsa order recommended in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The Mäyävädé sannyäsés, who are enamored of the external energy of the Lord, cannot understand the mind of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu."

The ekadaëòi-sannyäsés of the Mäyävädé school give up the sacred thread and do not keep any tuft of hair. Therefore they are unable to understand the purport of tridaëòa-sannyäsa, and as such they are not inclined to dedicate their lives to the service of Mukunda. They simply think of merging into the existence of Brahman because of their disgust with the material existence. The äcäryas who advocate the daiva-varëäçrama (the social order of cätur-varëyam mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä) do not accept the proposition of äsura-varëäçrama, which maintains that the social order of varëa is indicated by birth."

It is said that from this Madhväcärya the sampradäya known in western India as the Vallabhäcärya-sampradäya has begun. Çréla Gopäla Bhaööa Vasu, who is known as a småty-äcärya in the Gauòéya Vaiñëava-sampradäya, later accepted the tridaëòa-sannyäsa order from Tridaëòipäda Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté. Although acceptance of tridaëòa-sannyäsa is not distinctly mentioned in the Gauòéya Vaiñëava literature, the first verse of Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé's Upadeçämåta advocates that one should accept the tridaëòa-sannyäsa order by controlling the six forces:"

Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu accepted Çrédhara Svämé, who was a tridaëòi-sannyäsé, but the Mäyävädé sannyäsés, not understanding Çrédhara Svämé, sometimes think that Çrédhara Svämé belonged to the Mäyäväda ekadaëòa-sannyäsa community. Actually this was not the case.\""
