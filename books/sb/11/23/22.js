    "translation": "Those who obtain human life, which is prayed for even by the demigods, and in that human birth become situated as first-class brähmaëas, are extremely fortunate. If they disregard this important opportunity, they are certainly killing their own self-interest and thus achieve a most unfortunate end.",

It is only in human life that one deeply considers one's ultimate benefit in life. Human birth is therefore more desirable than even that of the demigods.\" Within human life the position of a high-class brähmaëa is certainly most desirable. If a brähmaëa, however, gives up the devotional service of the Lord and works hard like a çüdra simply for the prestige of his community, he is certainly on the platform of material sense gratification. The special qualification of the brähmaëas is the spiritual knowledge by which they recognize every living entity to be an eternal servant of the Lord. A brähmaëa, free from false ego, thus feels himself lower than a blade of grass and tolerantly offers respect to all living entities. All human beings, and especially the brähmaëas, should avoid becoming killers of their own self-interest by neglecting Kåñëa consciousness, the loving service of the Lord. Such neglect paves the way for future suffering."
