Mahäräja Khaöväìga, as described in the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, fought valiantly on behalf of the demigods, and they offered the king any benediction he might desire. Khaöväìga Mahäräja chose to find out the remaining duration of his life, which unfortunately was a single moment. The king therefore immediately surrendered to Lord Kåñëa and achieved the spiritual world. The brähmaëa of Avanté desired to follow this example; with the blessings of the demigods, who are all devotees of the Lord, he hoped to become fully Kåñëa conscious before giving up his body."
