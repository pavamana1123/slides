    "translation": "Lord Çré Kåñëa said: Thus becoming detached upon the loss of his property, this sage gave up his moroseness. He left home, taking sannyäsa, and began to travel about the earth. Even when insulted by foolish rascals he remained unswerved from his duty and chanted this song.",

Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura states that if one is not capable of listening to the song of this sannyäsé, then one will certainly remain an obedient servant of material illusion."
