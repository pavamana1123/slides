Anurüpa means \"suitable\" or \"appropriate.\" The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, anxiously desires that all conditioned living entities come back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. Thus, the Lord reveals Himself in each of the four ages—Satya, Tretä, Dväpara and Kali—in a form appropriate for worship by the human beings of that age.

Therefore the incarnation of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is revealed in Vedic literature in a confidential, discrete way, so that it will be known to the authorized persons who can then propagate the mission of the Lord on the earth. We actually see in this modern age that many foolish and ordinary persons claim to be God or incarnations, avatäras, etc. There are many cheap philosophies and academies that promise, for a moderate fee, to make one God in a short time. In America one famous religious group promises its followers that they will all become the Supreme Lord in heaven. Such bogus preaching goes on in the name of Christianity. Thus, were Caitanya Mahäprabhu's name widely spoken of in Vedic literature, there would soon be a veritable plague of imitation Caitanya Mahäprabhus infesting the world."

This discrete system, selected by the Lord Himself for His appearance in Kali-yuga, is proving to be greatly successful on the earth planet. And throughout the world millions of people are chanting the holy names of Kåñëa without the unbearable harassment of hundreds and thousands of imitation Caitanya Mahäprabhus. Those who seriously desire to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead can easily understand the Lord's mission, whereas cynical materialistic rascals, puffed up by false prestige and madly considering their insignificant intelligence to be greater than the intelligence of Lord Kåñëa, cannot understand the beautiful arrangements made by the Lord for His graceful descent into the material world. Thus, although Kåñëa is çreyasäm éçvaraù, or the Lord of all benedictions, such foolish persons turn away from the Lord's mission and in this way deprive themselves of their own true benefit in life."
