    "translation": "My dear Lord, You are the Mahä-puruña, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and I worship Your lotus feet, which are the only eternal object of meditation. Those feet destroy the embarrassing conditions of material life and freely award the greatest desire of the soul, the attainment of pure love of Godhead. My dear Lord, Your lotus feet are the shelter of all holy places and of all saintly authorities in the line of devotional service and are honored by powerful demigods like Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä. My Lord, You are so kind that You willingly protect all those who simply bow down to You with respect, and thus You mercifully relieve all the distress of Your servants. In conclusion, my Lord, Your lotus feet are actually the suitable boat for crossing over the ocean of birth and death, and therefore even Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva seek shelter at Your lotus feet.\"",

The sage Karabhäjana, after describing the incarnation of Godhead in each of the three previous yugas-Satya, Tretä and Dväpara—presented suitable prayers which are utilized for glorifying the Lord in each particular age. After describing the Lord's manifestation in Kali-yuga with the verse kåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëam , this and the next verse are now presented to glorify the Lord's appearance in Kali-yuga as Caitanya Mahäprabhu, kåñëa-varëam. Caitanya Mahäprabhu appears in Kali-yuga and teaches everyone to chant the holy name of Kåñëa. The members of the ISKCON movement are so much absorbed in kåñëa-varëam, or chanting the holy names of Kåñëa, that sometimes ordinary persons refer to them as \"the Kåñëas.\" Thus whoever comes into contact with Caitanya Mahäprabhu's movement immediately begins to worship Kåñëa by chanting His holy name."

In Kali-yuga the authorized process of meditation is to chant the holy names of the Lord, especially the mantra Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. This process is to be executed constantly and always (sadä). Similarly, Caitanya Mahäprabhu stated, nämnäm akäri bahudhä nija-sarva-çaktis taträrpitä niyamitaù smaraëe na kälaù: in Kali-yuga, the Supreme Lord has kindly invested all of His potencies in His holy name, and there are no hard-and-fast rules for chanting such names. The mention of such rules refers to käla-deça-niyama, or regulations of time and place. Normally there are strict regulations governing the time, season, place, conditions, etc., under which one may execute a particular Vedic ceremony or chant a particular mantra. However, one should chant the holy name of Kåñëa everywhere and at all times, twenty-four hours a day. Thus there is no restriction in terms of time and place. This is the meaning of Caitanya Mahäprabhu's statement."

There is great envy, even among members of the same family, who constantly quarrel in this age. Similarly, neighbors are envious of each other and of each other's possessions and status. And entire nations, burning with envy, go to war unnecessarily at the risk of genocide caused by terrible modern weapons. But all of these harassments caused by family members, strangers, so-called friends who are unfaithful, opposing nations, financial competition, social disgrace, cancer, etc., can be relieved by taking shelter of the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu. It is not possible to save the material body, but one who takes shelter of Caitanya Mahäprabhu loosens the hard knot of the heart that psychologically binds him to the hallucination of identifying with the external body or the subtle material mind. Once this false identification is broken, one can be blissful in any adverse material condition. Those who foolishly try to make the temporary body eternal are wasting their time and neglecting the actual process for making life permanent, which is to take shelter of the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is Kåñëa Himself."

As the Kåñëa consciousness movement spreads all over the world, we often find, especially in poor third-world countries, that it is very difficult for people to travel to India to visit the most exalted holy places such as Våndävana and Mäyäpur. Especially in South America it is very difficult for a large number of devotees to visit such places in India and purify themselves. But Caitanya Mahäprabhu is so merciful that simply by worshiping Him, Vaiñëavas throughout the world receive the benefit of having visited the supreme holy place, namely the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Thus there is no loss for the followers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, despite their external situation."

In this age the world is so polluted by sinful life that it is very difficult to become free from all of the symptoms of Kali-yuga. Still, one who is faithfully serving in the missionary work of Caitanya Mahäprabhu need not fear occasional, unavoidable symptoms of Kali-yuga. The followers of Caitanya Mahäprabhu strictly follow the four regulative principles of no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating and no gambling. They try to always chant Hare Kåñëa and engage in the service of the Lord. However, it may happen that by accident an occasional symptom of Kali-yuga such as envy, anger, lust, greed, etc., may momentarily appear in the life of a devotee. But if such a devotee is actually surrendered at the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, by His mercy such an unwanted symptom, or anartha, will quickly disappear. Therefore, a sincere follower of the Lord should never be discouraged in the execution of his prescribed duty but should be confident that he will be protected by Caitanya Mahäprabhu."

Thus the devotee is not worried about his future destination, for he is confident that the Lord will quickly take him across the ocean of material existence. Such confidence is referred to in the Upadeçämåta by the word niçcayät, meaning firm conviction about the potency of the process of devotional service. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the statement çiva-viriïci-nutam is also understood to indicate that Caitanya Mahäprabhu is worshiped by Lord Çiva's incarnation Advaita Äcärya and by Lord Brahmä's incarnation Haridäsa Öhäkura."

Although the conditioned souls laboring arduously under illusion pursue many temporary goals in life, there is no possibility of their achieving actual bliss or knowledge. Such eternal bliss and knowledge is actually wealth. One should not neglect the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, taking Him to be an ordinary person, and instead accept the temporary, useless shelter offered by the illusory energy of the Lord."
