    "translation": "My dear Vasudeva, you and your good wife Devaké have manifested great transcendental love for Kåñëa, accepting Him as your son. Indeed, you are always seeing the Lord, embracing Him, speaking with Him, resting with Him, sitting together with Him and taking your meals with Him. By such affectionate and intimate association with the Lord, undoubtedly both of you have completely purified your hearts. In other words, you are already perfect.",

            "content": "The words ätmä väm pävitaù in this verse are very significant. Ordinary conditioned souls are required to purify their existence by practicing the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga and learning how to offer all of their activities in the devotional service of the Lord. Such a regulative, gradual process, however, cannot be applied to those exalted souls who are personally attending the Lord as His parents, boyfriends, girl friends, advisors, sons, etc. Due to Vasudeva and Devaké's intense love for Kåñëa as their son, they had already achieved the highest perfectional stage of life. Although in the previous verse Çré Närada Muni informed Vasudeva that he and his wife had become glorious by Kåñëa's taking birth as their son, Vasudeva might have argued that other personal associates of the Lord, such as Jaya and Vijaya, had fallen down due to offending the brähmaëa class. Therefore, in the present verse Närada has used the word pävitaù: \"You are completely purified, and therefore you are completely free from the slightest trace of discrepancy in your devotional service, due to your intense love for Kåñëa.\""

            "content": "It is understood from the commentary of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura that Çré Vasudeva, Kåñëa's pastime father, is actually an eternally liberated nitya-siddha associate of the Personality of Godhead. Vasudeva has a spiritual body, just as Kåñëa does, and he is always merged in the overwhelming ecstatic desire to serve Kåñëa, his beautiful son. However, Närada could understand that due to extreme humility, Vasudeva considered himself an ordinary human being and was feeling very anxious to receive transcendental instructions on the devotional service of the Lord. Accepting the ecstatic humility of Vasudeva, and to relieve his anxiety, Çré Närada Muni instructed him in the science of bhakti-yoga as one might instruct an ordinary human being. However, at the some time Närada has revealed that actually Çré Vasudeva and Devaké are already completely glorious by their unprecedented fortune of having Kåñëa and Balaräma as their sons. Therefore, Närada is telling Vasudeva, \"My dear Vasudeva, do not in any way be discouraged or doubtful about your position. Undoubtedly you are immediately going back home, back to Godhead. And actually you and your good wife are the most fortunate persons.\""

Many terrible demons who opposed Kåñëa eventually achieved a happy state of life by their association with Kåñëa. Therefore there is no doubt about the supreme bliss achieved by the loving devotees of the Lord who day and night can only think of pleasing Kåñëa."
