    "synonyms": "rajasä—by the prominence of the mode of passion; ghora-saìkalpäù—having horrible desires; kämukäù—lusty; ahi-manyavaù—their anger like that of a snake; dämbhikäù—deceitful; mäninaù—overly proud; päpäù—sinful; vihasanti—they make fun; acyuta-priyän—of those who are dear to the infallible Supreme Lord.",
    "translation": "Due to the influence of the mode of passion, the materialistic followers of the Vedas become subject to violent desires and are excessively lusty. Their anger is like that of a snake. Deceitful, overly proud, and sinful in their behavior, they mock the devotees who are dear to Lord Acyuta.",

            "content": "Ghora-saìkalpäù refers to ghastly desires, such as thinking, \"He is my enemy, let him die.\" Due to the mode of passion, waves of lust overcome the conditioned soul, who then becomes furious like a snake. Such a person, filled with pride and arrogance, cannot appreciate the humble efforts of the Lord's devotees to distribute Kåñëa consciousness. He thinks, \"These beggars worship Lord Viñëu to fill their bellies, but they will never be happy.\" Such a materialistic rascal cannot appreciate the transcendental status of the devotees of the Lord, who are personally protected and encouraged by the Personality of Godhead."
