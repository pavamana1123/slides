Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda has given the following commentary on this verse. \"This text is from Çrémad-Bhägavatam . Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has explained this verse in his commentary on the Bhägavatam known as the Krama-sandarbha, wherein he says that Lord Kåñëa also appears with a golden complexion. That golden Lord Kåñëa is Lord Caitanya, who is worshiped by intelligent men in this age. That is confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam by Garga Muni, who said that although the child Kåñëa was blackish, He also appears in three other colors—red, white and yellow. He exhibited His white and red complexions in the Satya and Tretä ages respectively. He did not exhibit the remaining color, yellow—gold, until He appeared as Lord Caitanya, who is known as Gaurahari."

            "content": "\"Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that kåñëa-varëam means Çré Kåñëa Caitanya. Kåñëa-varëam and Kåñëa Caitanya are equivalent. The name Kåñëa appears with both Lord Kåñëa and Lord Caitanya Kåñëa. Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He always engages in describing Kåñëa and thus enjoying transcendental bliss by chanting and remembering His name and form. Lord Kåñëa Himself appears as Lord Caitanya to preach the highest gospel. Varëayati means 'utters' or 'describes.' Lord Caitanya always chants the holy name of Kåñëa and describes it also, and because He is Kåñëa Himself, whoever meets Him will automatically chant the holy name of Kåñëa and later describe it to others. He injects one with transcendental Kåñëa consciousness, which merges the chanter in transcendental bliss. In all respects, therefore, He appears before everyone as Kåñëa, either by personality or by sound. Simply by seeing Lord Caitanya one at once remembers Lord Kåñëa. One may therefore accept Him as viñëu-tattva. In other words, Lord Caitanya is Lord Kåñëa Himself."

By His superexcellent beauty He subdues all the people of the age. In other descents the Lord sometimes used weapons to defeat the demoniac, but in this age the Lord subdues them with His all-attractive figure as Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that His beauty is His astra, or weapon, to subdue the demons. Because He is all-attractive, it is to be understood that all the demigods lived with Him as His companions. His acts were uncommon and His associates wonderful. When He propagated the saìkértana movement, He attracted many great scholars and äcäryas, especially in Bengal and Orissa. Lord Caitanya is always accompanied by His best associates like Lord Nityänanda, Advaita, Gadädhara and Çréväsa."

He comments that instead of engaging in such external, pompous exhibitions, all people, regardless of caste, color or creed, can assemble together and chant Hare Kåñëa to worship Lord Caitanya. Kåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëam  indicates that prominence should be given to the name Kåñëa. Lord Caitanya taught Kåñëa consciousness and chanted the name of Kåñëa. Therefore, to worship Lord Caitanya, everyone should together chant the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. To propagate worship in churches, temples or mosques is not possible because people have lost interest in that. But anywhere and everywhere, people can chant Hare Kåñëa. Thus worshiping Lord Caitanya, they can perform the highest activity and fulfill the highest religious purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord."
