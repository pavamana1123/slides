            "content": "The Lord's transcendental body in Dväpara-yuga can be compared to the color of a dark blue flower. The Lord exhibits His personal transcendental weapons such as Sudarçana cakra, and all of the limbs of His body, especially His hands and feet, are decorated with auspicious symbols such as a lotus flower and a flag. And on His chest, the Lord manifests the Kaustubha jewel as well as the auspicious Çrévatsa, a whorl of hair curling from left to right on the right side of the Lord's chest. Actually, such auspicious marks as Kaustubha and Çrévatsa, as well as the weapons of the Lord, are present in all of the viñëu-tattva incarnations. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that these universal characteristics of the Lord mentioned by the sage Karabhäjana are indications of the Kåñëa avatära. Because Kåñëa is the source of all incarnations, all of the symptoms of all other incarnations are to be found in His transcendental body."
