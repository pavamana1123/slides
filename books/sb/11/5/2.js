According to Çrédhara Svämé, the brähmaëas are born of the mode of goodness, the kñatriyas of a combination of goodness and passion, the vaiçyas of a combination of passion and ignorance and the çüdras of the mode of ignorance. Just as the four social orders are born from the face, arms, thighs and feet of the Lord's universal form, similarly the brahmacärés are generated from the heart of the Lord, the householder order from His loins, the vänaprasthas from His chest and the sannyäsa order from His head."

            "content": "It is understood that pure devotional service to the Lord has already been described by two of the Yogendras, Drumila and Ävirhotra. Camasa Muni now describes the system of varëäçrama-dharma, because this system is meant to gradually purify those who are inimical to the Supreme Lord, bringing them back to their constitutional position of love of Godhead. Similarly, the viräö-rüpa, or universal form of the Lord, is an imaginary form meant to help the gross materialists gradually understand the position of the Personality of Godhead. Since the foolish materialist cannot understand anything beyond matter, he is encouraged to see the entire universe as a personal form of the Supreme Lord's body. The impersonal conception of formlessness is a mere negation of temporary material variety without any concept of the Lord's spiritual potency. The impersonal view is another kind of material speculative conception. The Supreme Lord is full of spiritual potencies under the principal headings hlädiné, or unlimited bliss, sandhiné, or eternal existence, and saàvit, or omniscience. It is understood from this verse that the varëäçrama-dharma system generated from the universal form of the Lord is a program offered by the Lord to engage the conditioned souls in a complete social and religious system that gradually brings them back home, back to Godhead."
