    "translation": "O Mahä-puruña, I worship Your lotus feet. You gave up the association of the goddess of fortune and all her opulence, which is most difficult to renounce and is hankered after by even the great demigods. Being the most faithful follower of the path of religion, You thus left for the forest in obedience to a brähmaëa's curse. Out of sheer mercifulness You chased after the fallen conditioned souls, who are always in pursuit of the false enjoyment of illusion, and at the same time engaged in searching out Your own desired object, Lord Çyämasundara.",

This verse appears within the discussion by the sage Karabhäjana of the yugävatäras, or the different incarnations of the Personality of Godhead who deliver the conditioned souls of each age. The prayers ending with the words vande mahäpuruña te caraëäravindam are understood to glorify the incarnation of Lord Kåñëa in Kali-yuga known as Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Caitanya Mahäprabhu lived for twenty-four years in Navadvépa as a householder and enjoyed immense popularity among both scholars and ordinary persons. His saìkértana movement was completely supported by the local government, even though it was Muslim. And Caitanya Mahäprabhu had the pleasure of marrying the goddess of fortune. No ordinary woman of the material world, no matter how gorgeous she may be, can in any way compare with the beautiful goddess of fortune. Everyone in the universe, including Lord Brahmä, is searching after the goddess of fortune. Therefore it is stated here, surepsita."

            "content": "However, Caitanya Mahäprabhu is Lord Kåñëa appearing as a brähmaëa, and therefore He is certainly dharmiñöhaù, or the most religious. Actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always dharmiñöhaù, whether He appears as a cowherd boy, a great king or a brähmaëa, because the Lord Himself is the original source and personification of all religious principles. However, in the pastimes of Caitanya Mahäprabhu there are very few political or economic activities. Caitanya Mahäprabhu appeared as a great philosopher—brähmaëa, and thus He is certainly dharmiñöhaù. In Caitanya-caritämåta, in the Seventeenth Chapter of the Adi-lélä, it is described that a certain brähmaëa, who was well known for being harsh and cursing others, could not enter the kértana hall where Caitanya Mahäprabhu was performing kértana because the door was locked. Being very agitated and breaking his brähmaëa's thread, he cursed Caitanya Mahäprabhu the next day on the bank of the Ganges, saying, \"I shall now curse You, for Your behavior has greatly aggrieved me. You shall be bereft of all material happiness.\" However, Caitanya Mahäprabhu felt great jubilation within Himself, since His mission was vairägya-vidyä-nija-bhakti-yoga —to give up the illusion of material sense gratification and staunchly engage twenty-four hours a day in the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore, Caitanya Mahäprabhu took this curse as a blessing, and soon after, the Lord took sannyäsa. Thus it is stated in this verse that by the words of the Äryan, the brähmaëa (ärya-vacasä), Caitanya Mahäprabhu took sannyäsa (yad agäd araëyam) and went traveling through the different forests of India on the way to Våndävana, and later South India. Caitanya Mahäprabhu wanted especially to preserve the prestige of the brähmaëa class, and therefore He decided to keep the brähmaëa's curse intact."

Mäyä means one's so-called wife, children and bank account, which keep one firmly bound up in the material bodily concept of life. The word mågam indicates mågyati, or \"to search out.\" Thus, mäyä-mågam indicates the conditioned living entity, who is always frantically searching for the latest up-to-the-minute sense gratification in the material bodily concept of society, friendship and love. Anvadhävat indicates that Caitanya Mahäprabhu was always visibly going here and there, searching after the fallen conditioned souls. Caitanya Mahäprabhu would sometimes embrace the conditioned souls on the pretext of religious friendship or ecstasy. But actually, the Lord was touching the bodies of the conditioned souls to pull them out of the ocean of material existence and hurl them into the ocean of ecstatic love of Godhead. Thus Caitanya Mahäprabhu was the most merciful and munificent incarnation of the Lord, whose mercy surpassed the bounds of mundane discrimination in the matter of caste, color and creed."

The quality of being the most merciful is part and parcel of the character of the mahä-puruña, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Thus the words surepsita-räjya-lakñmém indicate çré-mathurä-sampattim, or the opulence of Mathurä. Mathurä is described in Vedic literature as the reservoir of all opulence because of the touch of the Lord's lotus feet in that precinct. But Kåñëa, although taking birth in the opulent city of Mathurä, transferred Himself to the forest village of Våndävana. In this case the word ärya-vacasä indicates the order of Lord Kåñëa's original parents, Vasudeva and Devaké. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  both Vasudeva and Devaké express their fear at the threat of Kaàsa, who had already killed all of Kåñëa's elder brothers. The word ärya-vacasä thus indicates that with great love they requested Kåñëa to kindly make some arrangement to avoid Kaàsa. And Kåñëa, to obey their order, transferred Himself to the forest village of Våndävana (yad agäd araëyam)."

Mäyä also indicates the internal potency of Kåñëa, yoga-mäyä. The original form of Kåñëa's internal potency is Çrématé Rädhäräëé. Due to the inconceivable love of Çrématé Rädhäräëé, Lord Kåñëa becomes easily controlled by Her. Thus, mågam, or \"animal\" in this case indicates kréòä-mågam, or \"a toy animal.\" Just as a beautiful young girl may play with so many dolls or stuffed animals, similarly Lord Kåñëa becomes just like a doll in the hands of the most beautiful young girl, Çrématé-Rädhäräëé. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, Çrématé Rädhäräëé performed innumerable types of worship in order to bind Kåñëa more and more to Her because Çrématé Rädhäräëé cannot live without Kåñëa. Thus, due to Çrématé Rädhäräëé's ärädhana, or worship, Kåñëa can never leave Våndävana. He runs here and there in Våndävana, protecting the cows, playing with His friends and engaging in countless intrigues of love with Çrématé Rädhäräëé and the gopés. Thus the word anvadhävat indicates Kåñëa's boyish activities, His running throughout the transcendental land of Våndävana, tightly under the control of the love of Çrématé Rädhäräëé."

Although the Lord is completely independent and detached from everything, He becomes attached to His pure devotees due to their love for Him. In the great capital of Ayodhyä all of the citizens loved Rämacandra more than can be described. In this context ärya-vacasä means that by the order of His father, who was just like His guru, Rämacandra gave up everything and went to the forest. There He exhibited His great affection for mother Sétä and chased after mäyä-mågam, or the illusory deer that had been created by the trick of Rävaëa. That this golden deer was especially desired by Çrématé Sétädevé is indicated by the word dayitayepsitam."

There is no factual difference in spiritual quality between the incarnations of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, Lord Kåñëa and Lord Çré Rämacandra. As stated in Vedic literatures, advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam (BS 5.33). Therefore there is no contradiction in the opinions of the äcäryas that this verse wonderfully glorifies three different manifestations of the one Absolute Truth. Caitanya Mahäprabhu is undoubtedly the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His transcendental attributes fulfill in every sense of the term the descriptions of the Absolute Truth as given in Vedic literature. In Caitanya-caritämåta, in the Third Chapter of the Adi-lélä, Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja Gosvämé and Çréla Prabhupäda have given elaborate explanations of the transcendental status of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, which the reader can refer to for further information."
