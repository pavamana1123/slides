In Tretä-yuga human society is described as dharmiñöhäù, or thoroughly religious, and brahma-vädinaù, or faithfully seeking the Absolute Truth through the Vedic injunctions. However, it should be noted that all of the exalted qualities of the people of Satya-yuga are not mentioned in this verse. In other words, in Satya-yuga people are automatically perfect, whereas in Tretä-yuga people are inclined to become perfect through performing Vedic sacrifice. In Tretä-yuga human society is not automatically Kåñëa conscious, as it was in Satya-yuga, but people are still highly inclined to become Kåñëa conscious, and thus they strictly follow the Vedic injunctions."
