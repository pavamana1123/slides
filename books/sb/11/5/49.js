His unlimited transcendental opulences are inexhaustible, and thus He very easily brings the entire creation under His personal control. Lord Kåñëa is the eternal well-wisher of every living entity, so there was no need for Vasudeva to be anxious about his future destination, nor that of the other personal associates of Kåñëa, such as the members of the Yadu dynasty. In verse 46 of this chapter, Närada Muni told Vasudeva, putratäm agamad yad väà bhagavän éçvaro hariù: \"You and your good wife are now glorified throughout the universe because Lord Kåñëa has personally become your son.\" In this way Närada is encouraging Vasudeva to continue to love Kåñëa as his most beloved son, for such ecstatic devotional feelings are never to be given up. But at the same time, Närada is removing Vasudeva's doubts about the future by assuring him, \"Due to your love for Kåñëa you may think that He is an ordinary human being. You are appearing like a human being, and Lord Kåñëa is simply reciprocating with you. In order to encourage you to love Him as your son, He is placing Himself under your control. And thus, His inconceivable power and opulences are being concealed from you. Don't assume, however, that there is actually a dangerous situation because of the events of this material world. Although Kåñëa appears to be under your control, He is eternally the supreme controller. Therefore, do not consider Him to be a human being. He is always the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\""

In this way the devotee is fully encouraged in his particular loving relationship with the Lord. However, when Vasudeva was filled with anxiety due to the dangerous situation created by the brähmaëa's curse, Närada immediately reminded him that such anxiety was unnecessary, since all these events were under the direct control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, the Vaiñëava paramahaàsas who take the position of the Lord's parents remain under the shelter of the Lord at all times and never deviate from the loving devotional service of the Lord. They remain fixed in transcendence in all circumstances, unlike ordinary parents of the material world, who are constantly becoming bewildered by illusion due to the bodily concept of life."
