    "translation": "Inimical kings like Çiçupäla, Pauëòraka and Çälva were always thinking about Lord Kåñëa. Even while they were lying down, sitting or engaging in other activities, they enviously meditated upon the bodily movements of the Lord, His sporting pastimes, His loving glances upon His devotees, and other attractive features displayed by the Lord. Being thus always absorbed in Kåñëa, they achieved spiritual liberation in the Lord's own abode. What then can be said of the benedictions offered to those who constantly fix their minds on Lord Kåñëa in a favorable, loving mood?",

However, Närada Muni assured Çré Vasudeva that the glories of Vasudeva and his good wife Devaké were chanted throughout the universe because even the demigods worshiped the exalted status of the Lord's own parents. Vasudeva was not only concerned about his own spiritual position, but he also lamented for the Yadu dynasty, which had left the world in an apparently inauspicious way, being cursed by great brähmaëas such as Närada and dying in a fratricidal war. Although the members of the Yadu dynasty were personal associates of the Lord, their disappearance from the earth was apparently inauspicious, and therefore Vasudeva was concerned about their eventual destination. So Närada here assures Vasudeva that even the demons who opposed Kåñëa, such as Çiçupäla, Pauëòraka and Çälva, achieved promotion to the Lord's own abode because of their constant absorption in thinking of Kåñëa. Therefore what to speak of the exalted members of the Yadu dynasty who actually loved Kåñëa more than anything (anurakta-dhiyäm punaù kim)? Similarly, it is stated in the Garuòa Puräëa,"

In the relationship between the father and son, sometimes the father must chastise the son and restrict him in various ways. In this way Vasudeva was feeling that undoubtedly he had offended the Lord in his attempt to train Lord Kåñëa as his son. However, Lord Kåñëa is actually pleased when a pure devotee becomes absorbed in parental love for Him and thus devotedly tries to care for Him just as loving parents care for a small child. Kåñëa reciprocates the intense devotional feelings of such devotees by actually appearing before them as a young boy and acting just like their son."

Therefore, what to speak of the destination of Vasudeva, who chastised Kåñëa due to his overwhelming parental love for Him? The conclusion is that the devotees of the Lord should never consider Vasudeva and Devaké to be ordinary, conditioned souls. Their relationship with Lord Kåñëa is completely on the transcendental platform of vätsalya-rasa, or parental love for the Personality of Godhead. It has nothing to do with the parental love of the material world, which is based on a mood of sense gratification, since the parents see their children as objects of material enjoyment."
