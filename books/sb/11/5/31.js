Thus it is surprising that in such a completely irreligious age the Supreme Lord is worshiped. Therefore it is stated kaläv api, \"even in Kali-yuga.\" In Kali-yuga the incarnation of the Personality of Godhead does not directly assert Himself to be the Personality of Godhead, but rather He is detected by expert devotees in accordance with the revealed Vedic scriptures. Similarly, Prahläda Mahäräja states in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

According to the age, O my Lord, You protect the principles of religion. In the age of Kali, however, You do not assert Yourself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore You are known as Triyuga, or the Lord who appears in three yugas.\" Thus it is understood that it is difficult for common people in Kali-yuga to recognize the incarnation of the Lord since in this age the Lord's appearance is slightly concealed."

It is stated in the Bhägavatam, stré-çüdra-dvija-bandhünäà trayé na çruti-gocarä:  in Kali-yuga it is impossible for ordinary people to perform highly technical Vedic sacrifices or the unbearable penances of the mystic yoga system. Such standard Vedic processes are practically inaccessible for the spiritually retarded population of Kali-yuga. Therefore the simple process of glorifying the Personality of Godhead by chanting His holy names is essential in this age. Such devotional processes as chanting the holy names of the Lord and worshiping His Deity form are elaborately described in the Vaiñëava çästras known as Païcarätras. Such tantric scriptures are referred to in this verse, and it is stated that in Kali-yuga these devotional processes, taught by great äcäryas such as Närada Muni, are the only practical means for worshiping the Lord. This will be more clearly explained in the following verse."
