O master of men, in the age of Kali those persons who drink the waters of the holy rivers of Draviòa-deça, such as the Tämraparëé, Krtamälä, Payasviné, the extremely pious Käveré and the Pratécé Mahänadé, will almost all be purehearted devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva.",

For example, although at present time in India we are experiencing spring weather, we know that in the future the torrid summer will come, followed by the rainy season, autumn and eventually winter and a new spring. Similarly, we know that these seasons have occurred repeatedly in the past. Thus, just as ordinary human beings can understand the past, present and future seasons of the earth, the liberated followers of Vedic culture can easily understand the past, present and future conditions of the seasonal ages of the earth and other planets. The inhabitants of Satya-yuga are certainly aware of the conditions of Kali-yuga. They know that in Kali-yuga the difficult material situation forces the living entity to take complete shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that the inhabitants of Kali-yuga therefore develop a high degree of love of Godhead. Therefore although the inhabitants of Satya-yuga are far more sinless, truthful and self-controlled than the people of other ages, they desire to take birth in Kali-yuga in order to taste pure love of Kåñëa."

Birth in this age is very favorable for one who is eager to associate with the devotees.

The word präyaù, or \"in general\" indicates that those who are offensive to the Lord's devotees, although claiming themselves to be devotees, are not included within the list of amaläçayäù, or purehearted souls. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that one should not be bewildered by seeing the apparently poverty-stricken condition of the inhabitants of South India. Even nowadays the inhabitants of the places mentioned in this verse generally spend their days with meager eating and clothing and live as great renounced devotees of the Supreme Lord. In other words, clothes do not make the man. To live as a polished animal, dressing oneself luxuriously and gratifying the tongue with rich foodstuffs, is not the actual symptom of an advanced transcendentalist. Although the residents of South India are generally Çré Vaiñëavas, or devotees in the Lakñmé-sampradäya, they are recognized as devotees of the Lord by the followers of Caitanya Mahäprabhu. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, their austere living conditions should be taken as a good qualification, not a disqualification."
