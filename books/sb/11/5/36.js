The word ärya has been defined by Çréla Prabhupäda as \"one who is advancing spiritually.\" The nature of an advanced person is to search for the essence of life. For example, the essence of the material body is not the body itself but the spirit soul that is within the body; therefore an intelligent person gives more attention to the eternal spirit soul than to the temporary body. Similarly, although Kali-yuga is considered to be an ocean of contamination, there is also an ocean of good fortune in Kali-yuga, namely the saìkértana movement. In other words, all of the degraded qualities of this age are completely counteracted by the process of chanting the holy names of the Lord. Thus it is stated in the Vedic language,"

I am eternal.\" One has to make further progress to discover that although one is eternal, there is a superior eternal entity, who is the Lord Himself within one's own heart and within every atom in the material universe. Beyond this second phase of self-realization there is the third and final stage of perfection, which is realization of Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His own abode."

            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not primarily the superintendent of this world but rather the enjoyer of His own world, which is beyond the most fantastic dreams of the conditioned living entity. In other words, although the king or president of a country is ultimately the controller of the prison department, the king or president derives actual pleasure within his own palace and not in administering justice to the foolish prisoners. Similarly, the Lord appoints the demigods to administer the material creation on His behalf while He Himself personally enjoys the ocean of transcendental bliss in His own transcendental kingdom. Thus, realization of the Lord within His own kingdom is far superior to the primitive understanding that the Lord is the \"creator\" of the prison of the material world. This realization of Bhagavän begins with understanding that there are innumerable Vaikuëöha planets in the spiritual sky and that on each of them a particular expansion of Näräyaëa dwells with His innumerable devotees who are attached to that particular form. The central and chief planet in the spiritual sky is called Kåñëaloka, and there the Personality of Godhead exhibits His supreme and original form of Govinda. As confirmed by Lord Brahmä, govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi. Lord Brahmä also states:"

That perfection is available in Kali-yuga simply by chanting the holy names of God: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Therefore every sane man, woman or child should deeply understand the unprecedented opportunity offered by Caitanya Mahäprabhu and seriously take up this chanting process. Only the most unfortunate and irrational person will neglect this transcendental opportunity."
