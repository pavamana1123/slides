            "content": "The sage Karabhäjana Muni is replying to Videharäja Nimi's questions about the varieties of the Lord's incarnations. In Satya-yuga the Lord's color is white, and He wears tree bark and a black deerskin as an ideal meditative brahmacäré. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has explained the Lord's various names in Satya-yuga as follows. Those who are self-realized know this supreme reality of the Personality of Godhead as Paramätmä, Those souls who are situated in the religious system of varëäçrama glorify Him as the haàsa who is transcendental to all the varëas and äçramas. Persons absorbed in gross matter consider Him to be Suparëa, \"the beautifully winged\" basis of the conceptions of cause and effect who flies within the subtle sky of the soul, as described in Chändogya Upaniñad. Persons accustomed to wandering within this universe of subtle and gross matter created by the Lord's illusory potency chant His name Vaikuëöha. Persons deprived of the power of transcendental meditation (dhäraëä), who are thus subject to falling from the path of religion, glorify Him as Dharma, or religion personified. Those who are forced to submit to the illusory modes of material nature and whose minds are uncontrolled and disturbed glorify Him as the most perfectly self-controlled Yogeçvara. Persons tainted by a mixture of the modes of passion and ignorance call Him Amala, or the uncontaminated. Persons devoid of potency call Him Éçvara, and those who consider themselves to be under His shelter chant His glories by the name Uttama Puruña. Those who know that this material manifestation is only temporary call Him Avyakta. In this way, in Satya-yuga Lord Väsudeva appears in various four-armed transcendental forms, and the jéva souls worship Him, each by their own particular process of devotional service. Therefore the Supreme Lord has many different names."
