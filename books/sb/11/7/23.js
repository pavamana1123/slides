            "content": "According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the word yuktäù in this verse indicates those engaged in the regulative practice of bhakti-yoga. The devotees of the Lord do not abandon their intelligence and become mindless fanatics, as some fools think. As indicated by the words anumänataù and guëair liìgaiù, a devotee engaged in bhakti-yoga intensely searches out the Personality of Godhead through all of the rational faculties of the human brain. The word mågayanti, or \"searching,\" does not, however, indicate an unregulated or unauthorized process. If we are searching for the telephone number of a particular person, we look in the authorized telephone directory. Similarly, if we are searching for a particular product, we go to a specialized store where we are likely to find what we are looking for. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé points out that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not a product of the imagination, and thus we cannot whimsically imagine what the Lord might be. Therefore, to gain information about Lord Kåñëa, one must conduct a regulated search in the authorized Vedic scriptures. The word agrähyam in this verse indicates that no one can achieve or understand Lord Kåñëa by ordinary speculation or through the activities of the material senses. In this regard Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé states the following verse in the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.2.234):"

All of these can be used to directly and indirectly perceive the Personality of Godhead. Indirectly one may experience the Lord through His creation. Since we are experiencing this world through our intelligence (and senses), we may conclude that our own intelligence must have a creator and that creator is therefore supremely intelligent.
