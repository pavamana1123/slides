The young brähmaëa was physically very attractive, and his senses were full of potency for material enjoyment, yet he was not at all affected by material lust. This position is called mukti, or liberation."

            "content": "Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains that within the Ganges flow great currents of water, capable of extinguishing a blazing fire. If an elephant maddened by sex desire stands within the Ganges, its powerful, cooling currents extinguish his lust, and the elephant becomes pacified. Similarly, ordinary human beings trapped in the cycle of birth and death are constantly harassed by the enemies of lust and greed, which never allow the mind to be completely peaceful. But if, following the example of the elephant, one situates oneself within the cooling waves of transcendental bliss, then all material desire will soon be extinguished, and one will become çänta, or peaceful. As described in Sr Caitanya-caritämåta, kåñëa-bhakta niñkäma ataeva çänta . Thus, everyone should take to the movement of Caitanya Mahäprabhu and cleanse himself in the cooling waters of Kåñëa consciousness, our real, eternal consciousness."
