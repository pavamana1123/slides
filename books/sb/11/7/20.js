The word çreyas in this verse indicates that one can advance in life through one's own intelligence. By good association one should gradually come to understand one's eternal position as servant of Kåñëa, and then one becomes very eager to live in the company of other enlightened persons. Birds of a feather flock together. The symptom of an enlightened servant of Kåñëa is that he is eager for the company of other such great souls. Thus by one's sensitive and rational observation of this material world, one should come to appreciate the value of spiritual life in the association of the devotees."
