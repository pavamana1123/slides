One should fix one's mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the source of everything. Thus as one passes one's life on the earth, using up one's allotted time, one should practice seeing all things and all people as part and parcel of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. Since all living entities are part and parcel of Kåñëa, ultimately they all have the same spiritual status. The material nature, also being an emanation of Kåñëa, has a similar spiritual status, but although matter and spirit are both emanations from the Personality of Godhead, they do not exist exactly on the same level. In Bhagavad-gétä it is said that the spirit soul is the superior energy of the Lord, whereas the material nature is His inferior energy. However, since Lord Kåñëa is equally present in all things, the word sama-dåk in this verse indicates that one must ultimately see Kåñëa within everything and everything within Kåñëa. Thus equal vision is compatible with mature knowledge of the varieties present within this world."

I have duly married many thousands of queens, headed by Rukmiëé, whom I personally kidnapped, and I have killed innumerable demons in various places and by various means.

In order to return the dead son of My spiritual master, Sändépani Muni, I personally went to the court of Ravinandana, or Yamaräja, and thus he was able to see Me face to face. I even blessed the residents of heaven, such as mother Aditi and Kaçyapa Muni, with My personal association when I traveled there to steal the pärijäta flower for My wife Satyabhämä. And in order to please the inhabitants of Mahä-Viñëu's abode, such as Nanda, Sunanda and Sudarçana, I traveled to Mahä-vaikuëöhaloka to recover the deceased children of a frustrated brähmaëa.

Nevertheless, Uddhava is practically the same as Me. He is a great devotee and shares My own transcendental opulences. Thus, he is the right person for Me to send to Badarikäçrama. I shall give Uddhava complete transcendental knowledge by which one becomes detached from the material world, and he in turn can deliver this knowledge, the science of transcending the kingdom of illusion, to the worthy sages at Badarikäçrama. In this way he can teach them the method of rendering loving devotional service to My lotus feet. Such loving devotional service rendered to Me is the most valuable treasure, and by hearing such knowledge the desires of the great sages such as Nara-Näräyaëa will be completely fulfilled."

At the present time thousands of devotees in the Kåñëa consciousness movement, in all parts of the world, are working long hours under difficult conditions to distribute transcendental literature and thus enlighten the general populace. In this effort the devotees have no personal motivation but are simply desirous of pleasing their spiritual master by distributing his books. The people who receive this literature usually have no previous experience of Kåñëa consciousness, yet they are so impressed by the purity of the devotees they meet that they eagerly purchase the books and magazines. In order to execute the tremendous task of spreading Kåñëa consciousness, the devotees are tirelessly laboring day and night because they are on the platform of loving devotion. Although superficially such busy devotees may occasionally not think directly of the lotus feet of Kåñëa, such loving devotion will undoubtedly take them back to Kåñëa's lotus feet, and being pleased by their service, the Lord Himself will again arouse their unflinching meditation upon His personal form. This is the beauty of bhakti-yoga, which depends wholly and solely on the mercy of the all-merciful Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. This is the only totally safe means of uprooting the deep desires for material enjoyment, attaining pure love for Kåñëa and going beyond the material universe to the kingdom of God.

One may not be able to physically give up association with family and friends, but one should understand that everyone and everything is part and parcel of God and is meant for the pleasure of God. As soon as one thinks, \"This is my personal family,\" immediately one will see the material world as no more than a place for enjoying family life. As soon as one is attached to one's so-called family, false prestige and material possessiveness arise. Actually, everyone is part and parcel of God and therefore, on the spiritual platform, related to all other entities. This is called kåñëa-sambandha, or the constitutional relationship with Kåñëa. It is not possible to advance to the highest stage of spiritual awareness and at the same time maintain a petty material concept of society, friendship and love. One should experience all relationships on the higher, spiritual platform of kåñëa-sambandha, which means seeing everything in relation to Lord Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead."
