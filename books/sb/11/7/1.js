Although Lord Viñëu is sometimes counted among the demigods, His abode is in Vaikuëöha, the spiritual sky. The demigods are universal controllers within the kingdom of mäyä, but Viñëu is the Lord of the illusory potency and many other spiritual potencies. His exalted residence does not lie within the kingdom of His insignificant maidservant mäyä."

            "content": "Lord Viñëu, the Personality of Godhead, is the Supreme Lord of all lords; the demigods are His separated parts and parcels. Being themselves minute jéva souls, the demigods are under the influence of the potency of mäyä; but Lord Viñëu is always the supreme controller of mäyä. The Personality of Godhead is the reservoir and root of all existence, and the material world is just a dim reflection of the brilliant scenery of His eternal, spiritual abode, where everything is infinitely beautiful and pleasurable. Viñëu is the supreme reality, and no living entity can ever be equal to or greater than Him. The Lord exists within His own unique category called viñëu-tattva, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All other prominent or extraordinary living entities owe their positions and potencies to the Lord. Ultimately Viñëu Himself is a plenary expansion of Lord Kåñëa, the original source of all the viñëu-tattva and jéva-tattva expansions. Thus Lord Kåñëa is the basis of everything."
