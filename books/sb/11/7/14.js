    "translation": "Çré Uddhava said: My dear Lord, You alone award the results of yoga practice, and You are so kind that by Your own influence You distribute the perfection of yoga to Your devotee. Thus You are the Supreme Soul who is realized through yoga, and it is You who are the origin of all mystic power. For my supreme benefit You have explained the procedure for giving up the material world through the process of sannyäsa, or renunciation.",

Since all of the material and spiritual worlds emanate from the transcendental body of Kåñëa, there is nothing to be achieved by any yoga process except Kåñëa and His potencies. And since the Lord remains eternally the master of His potencies, no one can achieve anything through yoga, or any other spiritual or material process, except by the sanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word yoga means \"linking up,\" and unless we link ourselves with the Absolute Truth, we remain covered by the darkness of ignorance. Thus, Kåñëa is the goal of yoga."

Man wants to link with woman and woman with man, or one tries to link up with nationalism, socialism, capitalism or innumerable other creations of the illusory energy of the Lord. Since we are linking ourselves to temporary objects the relationships are temporary, the results are temporary, and at the time of death we become bewildered when all of our connections are suddenly cut off by mäyä. If we link ourselves to Kåñëa, however, our relationship with Him will continue even after death. As explained in Bhagavad-gétä, the relationship with Kåñëa that we develop in this life will continue to increase in our next life until we achieve the supreme goal of entering Kåñëa's planet. Those who sincerely serve the mission of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, following the transcendental life-style prescribed by the Lord, will enter the Lord's abode at the end of this lifetime."

            "content": "One can never achieve a permanent situation by mental speculation, and what to speak of by ordinary material sense gratification. By the methods of haöha-yoga, karma-yoga, räja-yoga, jïäna-yoga, etc., one does not actually awaken his propensity for rendering eternal loving service to the Personality of Godhead. Thus, one is bereft of the transcendental tastes of spiritual enjoyment. Sometimes the conditioned soul, disgusted by his failure to gratify his senses, bitterly decides to renounce the material world and merge into an impersonal, painless transcendence. But our actual happy situation is to render loving service at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead. All of the different yoga processes gradually lead one to love of Godhead, and it is Lord Kåñëa's aim to reestablish the conditioned souls in this happy position. Caitanya Mahäprabhu is making this perfection easily available through the chanting of the holy name of Kåñëa, the supreme yoga process for this age."
