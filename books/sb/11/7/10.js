    "translation": "Being fully endowed with conclusive knowledge of the Vedas and having realized the ultimate purpose of such knowledge in practice, you will be able to perceive the pure self, and thus your mind will be satisfied. At that time you will become dear to all living beings, headed by the demigods, and you will never be hampered by any disturbance in life.",

The demigods, however, are never displeased with one who becomes a pure devotee of Lord Kåñëa and offers all of his worship to the Lord. The demigods themselves are humble servants of Lord Kåñëa, as was amply demonstrated in Lord Kåñëa's pastimes on the earth. One who can experience the eternal soul within everyone's body certainly becomes dear to all living beings. Since he sees everyone as qualitatively equal to himself, he does not envy anyone nor try to lord it over any other living being. Being free from envy and a well-wisher of all, such a self-realized soul is naturally dear to everyone. As stated in the song to the six Gosvämés, dhérädhéra-jana-priyau priya-karau nirmatsarau püjitau."
