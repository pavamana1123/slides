Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has pointed out that the Yadu dynasty was not actually destroyed by Lord Kåñëa but merely removed from the vision of the world through the curse of the brähmaëas; similarly, the Lord's eternal abode Dvärakä can never be drowned by the ocean. Nevertheless, all external approaches to this transcendental city were covered by the ocean, and thus the Lord's abode remains inaccessible to foolish persons in Kali-yuga, as will be described later in this canto."

            "content": "By the Lord's mystic potency, called yoga-mäyä, He reveals His own form, abode, paraphernalia, pastimes, entourage, and so on, and at the suitable time He removes all of these from our mundane sight. Although bewildered conditioned souls may doubt the spiritual potency of the Lord, the pure devotees can directly perceive and relish His transcendental appearance and disappearance, which are described in Bhagavad-gétä as janma karma ca me divyam . If one faithfully accepts this perfect knowledge of the Lord's transcendental nature, then surely one will go back home, back to Godhead, and become an eternal companion of Lord Kåñëa."
