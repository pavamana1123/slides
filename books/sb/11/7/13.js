    "translation": "Çré Çukadeva Gosvämi said: O King, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, thus instructed His pure devotee Uddhava, who was eager to receive knowledge from the Lord. Uddhava then offered obeisances to the Lord and spoke as follows.",

It is clear from previous verses that Çré Uddhava is a pure devotee of Lord Kåñëa and that he considers devotional service to Lord Kåñëa to be the perfection of life. Thus the words tattvaà jijïäsuù indicate that since Lord Kåñëa is about to leave the earth, Uddhava is most anxious to deepen his understanding of the Lord so that he may further advance in loving service at the Lord's lotus feet. Unlike an ordinary philosopher or scholar, a pure devotee is not eager to acquire knowledge for personal gratification."
