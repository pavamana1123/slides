    "translation": "Just as the sun evaporates large quantities of water by its potent rays and later returns the water to the earth in the form of rain, similarly, a saintly person accepts all types of material objects with his material senses, and at the appropriate time, when the proper person has approached him to request them, he returns such material objects. Thus, both in accepting and giving up the objects of the senses, he is not entangled.",

The devotees of Lord Kåñëa should not merely accumulate material wealth, but should distribute the opulences of Lord Kåñëa in such a way that the Kåñëa consciousness movement spreads unlimitedly. This is a lesson to be learned from the sun."
