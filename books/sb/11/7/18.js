    "translation": "Therefore, O Lord, feeling weary of material life and tormented by its distresses, I now surrender unto You because You are the perfect master. You are the unlimited, all-knowing Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose spiritual abode in Vaikuëöha is free from all disturbances. In fact, You are known as Näräyaëa, the true friend of all living beings.",

By the laws of nature there is always anxiety in material existence, and terrible tragedies periodically harass the conditioned souls. Here Uddhava points out that only Çré Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead, is a proper master, friend and shelter for the conditioned souls. We may be attracted by the good qualities of a particular man or demigod, but we may later discover discrepancies in that person's behavior. Therefore Kåñëa is described as anavadyam. There are no discrepancies in the personal conduct or character of the Personality of Godhead; He is eternally faultless."

Therefore Lord Kåñëa is here described as ananta-päram, which indicates that He is not limited by time or space. The word anta indicates the termination of time, and pära indicates a spatial termination; therefore ananta-päram means that Lord Kåñëa is not limited by time or space and thus will always dutifully reward His faithful servants."

Therefore Lord Kåñëa is described here as sarva-jïam, omniscient. He can never forget the service of His devotee, and therefore He is never ungrateful. In fact, it is said that Lord Kåñëa does not remember the faults of His devotees but only the sincere service they have rendered."

If we take shelter of our nation, that nation may be destroyed in war. If we take shelter of our family, they may also die. And as described in the Vedic literature, even the demigods are sometimes defeated by the demons. But since Lord Kåñëa is described here as éçvara, or the supreme controller, there is no danger of His being overcome or even impeded by any other power. Thus Lord Kåñëa's promise of protection to His devotee is eternally valid."

Lord Kåñëa has an eternal abode called Vaikuëöha, and that abode is never disturbed by anything. The faithful servants of Lord Kåñëa will certainly go back to Godhead, back home, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in the personal abode of the Lord. However, since even the demigods, and what to speak of insignificant human beings, are subject sooner or later to annihilation, what ultimate benefit can be derived from serving them?"

            "content": "Uddhava describes his personal situation as nirviëëa-dhéù and våjinäbhitaptaù. In other words, Çré Uddhava states that he is exhausted and discouraged by the contradictions and anguish of material life. He has been forced, therefore, to become humble and surrender to the lotus feet of Kåñëa, the personal friend of every living entity. In the material world a great man does not have time for insignificant men. But although the Lord is the greatest person, He sits in the heart of every living entity; thus He is the most merciful. Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate shelter of even Nära, or the Lord's puruña expansion who creates the material world. The living entity is called nara, and the source of his material situation is Nära, or Mahä-Viñëu. The word näräyaëa indicates that even Mahä-Viñëu finds His shelter in Kåñëa, who is certainly supreme. Although our consciousness is presently contaminated by sinful propensities, if we follow the example of Çré Uddhava and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, everything can be rectified. Taking shelter of Kåñëa means taking shelter of devotional service to Kåñëa and obeying Him. Lord Kåñëa demands this in Bhagavad-gétä, and if we comply with the order of the Lord our life can become fully auspicious and successful. Sooner than we expect, we may, by Kåñëa's mercy, enter the kingdom of God for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge."
