    "translation": "My dear Uddhava, an intelligent person should never take to literatures that do not contain descriptions of My activities, which purify the whole universe. Indeed, I create, maintain and annihilate the entire material manifestation. Among all My pastime incarnations, the most beloved are Kåñëa and Balaräma. Any so-called knowledge that does not recognize these activities of Mine is simply barren and is not acceptable to those who are actually intelligent.",

The Lord's incarnation for executing wonderful pastimes is called lélävatära, and such wonderful forms of Viñëu are glorified by the names Rämacandra, Nåsiàhadeva, Kürma, Varäha, and so on. Among all such lélävatäras, however, the most beloved, even to this day, is Lord Kåñëa, the original source of the viñëu-tattva. The Lord appears in the prison house of Kaàsa and is immediately transferred to the rural setting of Våndävana, where He exhibits unique childhood pastimes with His cowherd boyfriends, girl friends, parents and well-wishers. After some time, the Lord's pastimes are transferred to Mathurä and Dvärakä, and the extraordinary love of the inhabitants of Våndävana is exhibited in their anguished separation from Lord Kåñëa. Such pastimes of the Lord are épsita, or the reservoir of all loving exchanges with the Absolute Truth. The pure devotees of the Lord are most intelligent and expert and do not pay any attention to useless, fruitless literatures that neglect the highest truth, Lord Kåñëa. Although such literatures are very popular among materialistic persons all over the world, they are completely neglected by the community of pure Vaiñëavas. In this verse the Lord explains that the literatures approved for the devotees are those that glorify the Lord's pastimes as the puruña-avatära and the lélävatäras, culminating in the personal appearance of Lord Kåñëa Himself, as confirmed in Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38):"
