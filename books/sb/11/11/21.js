The path of jïäna is interesting only to one who does not know that Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä :"

One should know why the Personality of Godhead is all-pervading. The first verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam states, janmädy asya yataù:  the Supreme Lord is the source of everything. And as stated in the previous verse of this chapter, He creates, maintains and annihilates everything. Thus the Lord is not all-pervading in the manner of air or sunlight; rather, the Lord is all-pervading as the absolute controller who holds in His hands the destiny of every living entity."

Meditation upon any other object is also meditation on Kåñëa but is imperfectly performed, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä by the word avidhi-pürvakam. The Lord also states in the Gétä that all living entities are on the path back home, back to Godhead. Because of ignorance, however, some of them go backward or stop along the way, foolishly thinking that their journey is finished, when in fact they are suspended in one of the minor potencies of the Supreme Lord. If one wants to intimately understand the nature of the Absolute Truth, one must take to the path of love of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä :"

The word bhramam indicates a mistake; it can also mean \"wandering\" or \"rotating.\" The conditioned living entity, because of his mistake of falling into illusion, is wandering through a succession of material bodies, sometimes appearing as a demigod and sometimes as a worm in stool. The word upärameta means that one should stop such fruitless wandering and fix one's mind on the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Lord, who is the true object of everyone's love. Such a conclusion is not sentimental but is the result of keen analytic intelligence (jijïäsayä). Thus after elaborately explaining to Uddhava many aspects of analytic knowledge, the Lord now comes to the ultimate conclusion, Kåñëa consciousness, pure love of Godhead. Without such love there is no question of eternally fixing one's mind on the Lord."

All of these illusions are called bhrama, or mistakes, but such ignorance can be eliminated at once by the chanting of the holy names of Kåñëa: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare."
