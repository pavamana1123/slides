    "translation": "My dear Uddhava, I am personally the ultimate shelter and way of life for saintly liberated persons, and thus if one does not engage in My loving devotional service, which is made possible by associating with My devotees, then for all practical purposes, one possesses no effective means for escaping from material existence.",

            "content": "Lord Kåñëa has described to Uddhava the characteristics of jïäna-yoga and bhakti-yoga, both of which are considered to be spiritual processes. Now, however, Lord Kåñëa clearly indicates that bhakti-yoga is the only real means to totally free oneself from material existence, and that bhakti-yoga is not possible without sat-saìga, or association with other Vaiñëavas. On the path of bhakti-miçra jïäna, or speculation on the Absolute Truth mixed with devotion, one is still affected by the three modes of material nature. The pure soul, liberated from all material qualities, has no tendency or desire to engage in philosophical speculation, severe austerities or impersonal meditation. The pure soul simply loves Kåñëa and wants to serve Him constantly. Jévera 'svarüpa' haya-kåñëera 'nitya-däsa.' . Pure devotional service to the Lord is called kevala-bhakti, whereas devotional service mixed with speculative propensities is called guëa-bhüta-bhakti, or devotional service polluted by the material modes of nature. One who is actually intelligent does not make a show of philosophical wizardry but rather discerns the superiority of pure love of Godhead and takes to the path of kevala-bhakti. One who emphasizes so-called intellectual achievements is actually less intelligent, because such a person is more attracted to intelligence than to the pure soul, which is superior. It should be understood, however, that pure devotional service is not nonphilosophical or anti-intellectual. The Absolute Truth is far more extensive than partial truth. Therefore, one who is in full knowledge of Lord Kåñëa has the greatest facility to engage in philosophical analysis, since a pure devotee is working with the entire range of conceptual categories. Those who do not know Lord Kåñëa are attracted to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Paramätmä, but they are not aware of the ultimate category of understanding called Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lacking knowledge of Bhagavän, such imperfect philosophers certainly do not understand the expansion, interaction and withdrawal of the Lord's innumerable potencies and thus cannot fully analyze them. By faithfully accepting everything Lord Kåñëa speaks as the absolute truth, one comes to the mature platform of philosophy and achieves perfect knowledge."

            "content": "In addition to philosophical or intellectual understanding, pure devotional service also awards all other benefits in life, both material and spiritual; therefore one who for any purpose whatsoever accepts a process other than devotional service has unfortunately misunderstood the nature of pure devotional service to Lord Kåñëa. It is emphasized here that one must cultivate devotional service in the association of other devotees. On the other hand, the jïäna-yoga process is cultivated alone, because it is difficult for even two mental speculators to be in the same place without their association degenerating into constant quarrel. Other processes of self-realization are compared to the nipples on a goat's neck. They look just like breast nipples, but they will not give any milk whatsoever. In this regard Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has quoted the following verses, spoken by Çré Uddhava, Çukadeva Gosvämé and Närada Muni respectively."

The chances are certainly zero. One may concoct a type of liberation on the mental platform, or one may live in a so-called spiritual society of mutual flattery, but if one actually wants to go back home, back to Godhead, and see with spiritual eyes the beautiful kingdom of God called Kåñëaloka, one must take to Lord Caitanya's movement and worship Lord Kåñëa in the association of the bhakta-gaëa, the devotees of the Lord."
