            "content": "Unless one understands that Lord Kåñëa is all-pervading and that everything is resting within the Lord, one's Kåñëa consciousness is third class and materialistic. It is clearly stated in all Vedic literatures that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the source of everything. Everything is within Him, and He is within everything. To avoid a materialistic conception of Lord Kåñëa, one should not think that the Lord exists only in a particular time and place. Rather, one should understand that He exists at all times and in all places and that one may search for and find Lord Kåñëa within all things. The word püjä-padäni indicates that Lord Kåñëa is all-pervading, but this does not mean that all things are Lord Kåñëa. Lord Kåñëa speaks this verse to clarify His supremacy as the all-pervading Personality of Godhead and to show the path of complete self-realization."
