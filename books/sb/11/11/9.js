    "translation": "An enlightened person who is free from the contamination of material desire does not consider himself to be the performer of bodily activities; rather, he knows that in all such activities it is only the senses, born of the modes of nature, that are contacting sense objects born of the same modes of nature.",

They are meant for my pleasure.\" Similarly, if the body performs a wonderful activity, a Kåñëa conscious person does not become proud, nor is he depressed by the failure of the body to function in a particular way. In other words, Kåñëa consciousness means giving up identification with the gross and subtle material bodies. One should see them as the external energy of the Lord, working under the direction of the Lord's empowered representative mäyä. One absorbed in fruitive activities works under the jurisdiction of mahä-mäyä, or the external illusory potency, and experiences the miseries of material existence. On the other hand, a devotee works under the internal potency, called yoga-mäyä, and remains satisfied by offering his loving service to the Lord. In either case, the Lord Himself, by His multifarious potencies, is the ultimate performer of action."
