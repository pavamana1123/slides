    "translation": "By chance, two birds have made a nest together in the same tree. The two birds are friends and are of a similar nature. One of them, however, is eating the fruits of the tree, whereas the other, who does not eat the fruits, is in a superior position due to His potency.",

Just as a bird makes a nest in a tree, the living entity sits within the heart. The example is appropriate because the bird is always distinct from the tree. Similarly, both the individual soul and the Supersoul are distinct entities, separate from the temporary material body. The word balena indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by His own internal potency, which consists of eternality, omniscience and bliss. As indicated by the word bhüyän, or \"having superior existence,\" the Supreme Lord is always in a superior position, whereas the living entity is sometimes in illusion and sometimes enlightened. The word balena indicates that the Lord is never in darkness or ignorance, but is always full in His perfect, blissful consciousness."

Ultimately, the fruit of all material endeavor is death, hut the living entity foolishly thinks material things will bring him pleasure. The word sakhäyau, or \"two friends,\" is also significant. Our real friend is Lord Kåñëa, who is situated within our heart. Only He knows our actual needs, and only He can give us real happiness."

            "content": "Lord Kåñëa is so kind that He patiently sits in the heart, trying to guide the conditioned soul back home, back to Godhead. Certainly no material friend would remain with his foolish companion for millions of years, especially if his companion were to ignore him or even curse him. But Lord Kåñëa is such a faithful, loving friend that He accompanies even the most demoniac living entity and is also in the heart of the insect, pig and dog. That is because Lord Kåñëa is supremely Kåñëa conscious and sees every living entity as part and parcel of Himself. Every living being should give up the bitter fruits of the tree of material existence. One should turn one's face to the Lord within the heart and revive one's eternal loving relationship with one's real friend, Lord Kåñëa. The word sadåçau, or \"of similar nature,\" indicates that both the living entity and the Personality of Godhead are conscious entities. As part and parcel of the Lord we share the Lord's nature, but in infinitesimal quantity. Thus the Lord and the living entity are sadåçau. A similar statement is found in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (4.6):"
