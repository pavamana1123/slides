These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power.\""

            "content": "Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has written that the living entity has been executing fruitive activities since time immemorial. Thus his conditioned life may be called beginningless. Such conditioned life, however, is not endless, since the living entity may achieve liberation through the loving devotional service of the Lord. Since the living entity may acquire liberation, Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura states that his liberated life begins at a certain point but is endless, because liberated life is understood to be eternal. In any case, one who has achieved the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, may be understood to be eternally liberated, since such a person has entered into the eternal atmosphere of the spiritual sky. Since there is no material time in the spiritual sky, one who has achieved his eternal spiritual body on Lord Kåñëa's planet is not subject to the influence of time. His eternal blissful life with Kåñëa is not designated in terms of material past, present and future and is therefore called eternal liberation. Material time is conspicuous by its absence in the spiritual sky, and every living entity there is eternally liberated, having attained the supreme situation. Such liberation can be achieved by vidyä, or perfect knowledge, which is understood in three phases called Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän, as described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The ultimate phase of vidyä, or knowledge, is to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gétä such knowledge is called räja-vidyä, or the king of all knowledge, and it awards the supreme liberation."
