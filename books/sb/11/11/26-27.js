My dear ruler of the universal controllers, O Lord of Vaikuëöha and almighty God of the universe, I am Your devotee, and because I love You I have no other shelter than You.

Therefore, Uddhava naturally inquires about the symptoms of a distinguished devotee whose association can promote one to the kingdom of God. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé notes that the Personality of Godhead knows who is actually a sincere devotee because the Lord is always attached to His loving servitors. Similarly, pure devotees can expertly explain the proper methods of devotional service to Lord Kåñëa because they are already absorbed in love of Kåñëa. Uddhava herein requests Lord Kåñëa to describe the qualities of a devotee and asks the Lord to explain the devotional service that the devotees themselves approve as worthy to be offered to the Lord."

            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura remarks that the word puruñädhyakña indicates that Lord Kåñëa is the supreme ruler of the universal controllers headed by Mahä-Viñëu, and thus the Lord possesses infinite sovereignty. The term lokädhyakña indicates that Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate supervising authority of all of the Vaikuëöha planets, and therefore the Lord is unlimitedly glorious and perfect. Uddhava further addresses Lord Kåñëa as jagat-prabhu, because even in the illusory material world the Lord exhibits His unlimited mercy by personally incarnating to uplift the conditioned souls. The word praëatäya (\"Your surrendered devotee\") indicates that Uddhava is not proud like ordinary fools who do not enjoy bowing down to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Uddhava mentions that he is anuraktäya, or completely bound in love to Lord Kåñëa, because unlike other great devotees such as Arjuna, who sometimes worshiped demigods in order to comply with social customs or to show respect for their positions in the scheme of planetary management, Uddhava never worshiped any demigods. Therefore, Uddhava is prapannäya, or completely surrendered to Lord Kåñëa, having no other shelter."
