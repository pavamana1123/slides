            "content": "The word iñöä-pürtena, which means \"sacrificial performances and pious works,\" does not indicate deviation from the pure devotional service of the Lord. Lord Kåñëa, or Viñëu, is called Yajïa, or the Lord of sacrifice, and in Bhagavad-gétä  Lord Kåñëa says, bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäm: \"I am the actual enjoyer of all sacrifice.\" The highest sacrifice is to chant the holy names of the Lord, and by taking shelter of the Lord's names, one will acquire unflinching devotion and realized knowledge of the Absolute Truth. A realized devotee is very attentive in his devotional service, taking it as his life and soul. He keeps himself fit for devotional service by constantly worshiping and glorifying the lotus feet of the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such hari-näma-kértana and guru-püjä are the only practical methods by which one can achieve pure devotional service. When hari-kértana is expanded, it is called kåñëa-saìkértana. One should not dry up by performing unauthorized austerities or sacrifices; rather, one should engage with all enthusiasm in the great sacrifice of çré-kåñëa-saìkértana, which enables one to easily achieve the highest perfection of human life."
