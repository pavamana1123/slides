            "content": "According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, although yävän indicates that Lord Kåñëa cannot be limited by time or space, He becomes limited by the love of His pure devotees. For example, Lord Kåñëa never steps one foot out of Våndävana, because of the intense love of its inhabitants for Him. In this way, the Lord comes under the control of His devotees' love. The word yaù indicates that Kåñëa is the Absolute Truth who appears as the son of Vasudeva, or as Çyämasundara. Yädåça indicates that the Lord is ätmäräma, or completely self-satisfied, and also äpta-käma, or \"one who automatically fulfills all of His desires.\" Still, being affected by the love of His devotees, the Lord sometimes appears to be anätmäräma, or dependent on the love of His devotees, and anäptakäma, unable to achieve His desire without the cooperation of His devotees. Actually, the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, is always independent, but He reciprocates the intense love of His devotees and thus appears to be dependent on them, just as He apparently became dependent on Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä during His childhood pastimes in Våndävana. The word ajïätvä (\"inexperienced, lacking knowledge\") indicates that sometimes a devotee may not have a proper philosophical understanding of the Personality of Godhead or due to love may temporarily forget the Lord's position. In Bhagavad-gétä  Arjuna says,"

Please forgive whatever I may have done in madness or in love.\" Arjuna's words ajänatä mahimänam have the same meaning as Kåñëa's words ajïätvä mäm in this verse of the Bhägavatam. Both indicate incomplete understanding of Kåñëa's glories. In Bhagavad-gétä Arjuna says, praëayena: his forgetfulness of Kåñëa's supreme position was caused by his love for Him. In this verse, Kåñëa excuses such lapses on the part of His devotees with the words ajïätvä mäm, which indicate that even though devotees may not fully appreciate His exalted position, Kåñëa accepts their loving service. Thus this verse clearly reveals the supreme position of bhakti. Lord Kåñëa also states in Bhagavad-gétä :"

One must understand the Personality of Godhead as He is and love Him. Even if one is not capable of analytically understanding the position of God, if one simply loves Kåñëa, then one is certainly perfect. Many of the residents of Våndävana had no idea that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor did they know of Kåñëa's potencies or incarnations. They simply loved Kåñëa with their hearts and souls, and therefore they are considered most perfect."
