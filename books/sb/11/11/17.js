    "translation": "For the purpose of maintaining his body, a liberated sage should not act, speak or contemplate in terms of material good or bad. Rather, he should be detached in all material circumstances, and taking pleasure in self-realization, he should wander about engaged in this liberated life—style, appearing like a retarded person to outsiders.",

            "content": "According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, this verse describes a type of discipline recommended for the jïäna-yogés, who by intelligence try to understand that they are not their material bodies. One who is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, however, accepts and rejects material things in terms of their usefulness in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa. One who is trying to preach Kåñëa consciousness should be seen as very intelligent and not jaòa-vat, or stunted, as described here. Although a devotee of the Lord does not act, speak or contemplate for his personal sense gratification, he remains very busy working, speaking and meditating in the devotional service of the Lord. The devotee makes elaborate plans to engage all the fallen souls in Lord Kåñëa's service so they can be purified and go back home, back to Godhead. Merely rejecting material things is not perfect consciousness. One must see everything as the property of the Lord and meant for the Lord's pleasure. One busily engaged in spreading the Kåñëa consciousness movement has no time to make material distinctions and thus automatically comes to the liberated platform."
