Before the death of one's present body one can obtain transcendental knowledge or, by great fortune, pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. The word yadåcchayä indicates that if one somehow or other gets the association of pure devotees and hears from them faithfully, one can achieve Kåñëa consciousness, the highest perfection of life. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, through transcendental knowledge one obtains liberation, whereas through pure devotional service one can achieve love of Godhead, in which liberation is automatically included. Both results are certainly superior to ordinary, fruitive activities, by which one tries to enjoy much the same things that animals do. If one's devotional service is mixed with a tendency toward fruitive activities or mental speculation, then one may achieve the neutral stage of love of Godhead, whereas those who are inclined to serve only Lord Kåñëa advance to the higher stages of love of Godhead in servitude, friendship, parental love and the conjugal relationship."
