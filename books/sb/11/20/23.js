            "content": "Although it is difficult to control the mind, by constant practice the mind can be spiritualized in Kåñëa consciousness. A sincere disciple constantly remembers the instructions of his spiritual master and thereby faces again and again the stark truth that the material world is not the ultimate reality. By detachment and perseverance the mind gradually gives up its propensity toward sense gratification; thus illusion loses its grip on a sincere Kåñëa conscious devotee. Gradually the purified mind completely gives up the false identification with this world and transfers its attention to the spiritual platform. Then one is considered to be perfect in the yoga system."
