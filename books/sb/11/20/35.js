            "content": "\"A person who has broader intelligence, whether he be full of all material desire, without any material desire or desiring liberation, must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead.\" In this statement by Çukadeva Gosvämé, the words tévreëa bhakti-yogena are very significant. Çréla Prabhupäda remarks in this regard, \"As the unmixed sun ray is very forceful and is therefore called tévra, similarly, unmixed bhakti-yoga of hearing, chanting, etc., may be performed by one and all regardless of inner motive.\" Undoubtedly, in this age of Kali people are generally very fallen and polluted by material lust, greed, anger, lamentation and so forth. In this age most people are sarva-käma, or full of material desires. Still we must understand that simply by taking shelter of Lord Kåñëa we will achieve everything in life. The living entity should not engage in any process except the loving service of the Lord. One must accept that Lord Kåñëa is the reservoir of all pleasure and that only Lord Kåñëa within our heart can fulfill our real desire. This simple faith that one will achieve everything by approaching Lord Kåñëa is the essence of all knowledge and carries even a fallen person over the painful hurdles of this difficult age."
