    "synonyms": "varëa-äçrama—of the varëäçrama system; vikalpam—the variety of superior and inferior positions created by piety and sin; ca—and; pratiloma—birth in a mixed family wherein the father is inferior in social status to the mother; anuloma-jam—birth in a mixed family in which the father is superior in social status to the mother; dravya—material objects or possessions; deça—the place; vayaù—one's age; kälän—the time; svargam—heaven; narakam—hell; eva—indeed; ca—also.",
    "translation": "According to Vedic literature, the superior and inferior varieties found in the human social system, varëäçrama, are due to pious and sinful modes of family planning. Thus piety and sin are constant points of reference in the Vedic analysis of the components of a given situation—namely the material ingredients, place, age and time. Indeed, the Vedas reveal the existence of material heaven and hell, which are certainly based on piety and sin.",

            "content": "Pratiloma indicates the combination of a superior woman with an inferior man. For example, the vaidehaka community consists of those born of a çüdra father and brähmaëa mother, whereas the sütas are those born from a kñatriya father and a brähmaëa mother or from a çüdra father and kñatriya mother. Anuloma indicates those born from a superior father and inferior mother. The mürdhävasikta are those born of a brähmaëa father and kñatriya mother. Ambañöhas are those born from a brähmaëa father and vaiçya mother, and they often become medical men. Karaëa indicates those born of a vaiçya father and çüdra mother or of a kñatriya father and vaiçya mother. That such mixing of castes is not very much appreciated in the Vedic culture is demonstrated in the first chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. Arjuna was very worried that the death of so many kñatriyas on the battlefield would lead to the mixing of superior women with inferior men, and on those grounds he objected to fighting. In any case, the entire Vedic social system is based on distinguishing between piety and sin, and Çré Uddhava is encouraging the Lord to explain more elaborately His statement that one should transcend both piety and sin."
