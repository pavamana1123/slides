One who constantly engages in the devotional service of the Lord by hearing and chanting the Lord's transcendental glories with firm faith gets relief from the harassment of material desires. By serving the Lord one becomes strengthened in the conviction that Çré Kåñëa is the only actual enjoyer and all others are meant to share the Lord's pleasure through devotional service. A devotee of the Lord situates Çré Kåñëa on a beautiful throne within his heart and there offers the Lord constant service. Just as the rising sun gradually eliminates all trace of darkness, the Lord's presence within the heart causes all material desires there to weaken and eventually disappear. The words mayi hådi sthite (\"when the heart is situated in Me\") indicate that an advanced devotee sees Lord Kåñëa not only within his own heart but within the hearts of all living creatures. Thus a sincere devotee who chants and hears the glories of Çré Kåñëa should not be discouraged by the remnants of material desires within the heart. He should faithfully wait for the devotional process to naturally purify the heart of all contamination."
