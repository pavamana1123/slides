            "content": "\"For one who has taken his birth, death is certain; and for one who is dead, birth is certain. Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you should not lament.\" Mano yävat prasédati: Until one has established one's consciousness on the liberated platform of perfect knowledge, one must constantly ward off the attacks of illusion through rigid analytic observation of material nature. The material mind may be attracted to sex; therefore by spiritual intelligence one should scrutinize the temporary nature of one's own body and the body that has artificially become the object of one's material lust. One may apply this rigid analysis to all material bodies, from the fantastic cosmic body of Lord Brahmä down to that of the most insignificant germ. As previously stated by Lord Kåñëa, one who is advanced in Kåñëa consciousness spontaneously avoids sense gratification and is constantly drawn by spiritual love into his relationship with Lord Kåñëa. One who has not achieved the platform of spontaneous Kåñëa consciousness must remain constantly vigilant so as not to be grossly cheated by the material energy of the Lord. One who tries to exploit the material energy ruins his spiritual life and experiences varieties of misery."
