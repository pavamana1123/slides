You should mentally worship Him and meditate upon Him while you walk, while you stand, while you sleep and eat. You should see the Deity in front of you, behind, above, below and on both sides. In this way you should constantly remember My Deity form.\" In the Gautaméya-tantra one is enjoined to give the Deity of the Lord a brähmaëa thread, if possible one made of gold. In the Nåsiàha Puräëa it is stated, \"If one offers to Lord Govinda a yellow sacred thread containing three strands of silk, he will become an expert in Vedänta.\""
