Just as a farmer must pay a specific percentage of his agricultural profit to the king or political head as tax money, all human beings must offer a percentage of their material wealth to the demigods in sacrifice. In Bhagavad-gétä, however, the Lord explains that the demigods are also His servants and it is He Himself who awards all benedictions, through the agency of the demigods. Mayaiva vihitän hi tän. Although a Vaiñëava, or devotee of the Lord, has no need to worship the demigods, the demigods, being proud of their exalted material position, sometimes resent the exclusive devotion of the Vaiñëava to the Lord and thus try to cause the devotee to fall down, as described in this verse (sura-kåtä bahavo 'ntaräyäù). But the demigods here point out that Kåñëa is directly the protector of His devotees. Therefore, so-called impediments become stimuli for further spiritual advancement for a sincere devotee."

But by Your mercy even Your devotees pay little regard to us, so why should You take our foolish behavior seriously?\" The word yadi here is used to indicate the certainty that Kåñëa is always the protector of His surrendered devotees. Although there may be many obstacles on the path of the sincere devotee who is preaching the glories of the Lord, such obstacles increase the determination of the devotee. Therefore, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the continuous obstacles presented by the demigods form a kind of ladder or stairway upon which the devotee steadily progresses back to the kingdom of God. A similar verse appears in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"
