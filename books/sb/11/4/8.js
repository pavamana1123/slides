    "translation": "The primeval Lord, understanding the offense committed by Indra, did not become proud. Instead He spoke laughingly as follows to Cupid and his followers, who were trembling before Him: \"Do not fear, O mighty Madana, O wind-god and wives of the demigods. Rather, please accept these gifts I am offering you and kindly sanctify My äçrama by your presence.\"",

One should not think, \"I am a great, austere personality.\" Çré Nara-Näräyaëa could immediately understand the foolishness of Indra, and thus He was amused by the whole situation. Cupid and the heavenly women, understanding their great offense, were trembling before Nara-Näräyaëa in fear of receiving a powerful curse. But the Lord, exhibiting most sublime saintly behavior, reassured them by saying, mä bhaiù—\"Don't worry about it\"—and actually offered them nice prasädam and articles of worship. \"If you do not give Me the opportunity to act as host to the demigods and other respectable personalities,\" He said, \"what will be the use of My äçrama? My äçrama will be void without the opportunity to receive respectable personalities such as you.\""

            "content": "Similarly, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is establishing beautiful centers in all the major cities of the world. In some of these centers, such as those in Los Angeles, Bombay, London, Paris and Melbourne, the Society has established very gorgeous preaching äçramas. But the Vaiñëavas who live in these beautiful buildings feel that the buildings are void if guests do not come to hear about Kåñëa and chant His holy name. Thus, one may establish a beautiful äçrama not for one's personal sense gratification but to execute Kåñëa consciousness peacefully and encourage others to take to Kåñëa consciousness also."
