    "translation": "In the beginning, the original Supreme Personality manifested the form of Brahmä through the material mode of passion in order to create this universe. The Lord manifested His form as Viñëu, the Lord of sacrifice and protector of the twice-born brähmaëas and their religious duties, to maintain the universe. And when the universe is to be annihilated the same Supreme Lord employs the material mode of ignorance and manifests the form of Rudra The created living beings are thus always subject to the forces of creation, maintenance and destruction.",

            "content": "In the previous verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead was described as ädi-kartä, the original person responsible for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world. According to Çrédhara Svämé, ädi-kartä, or \"the original doer,\" implies subsequent creators, maintainers and annihilators. Otherwise there would be no meaning to the word ädi, or \"original.\" Therefore this verse describes that the Absolute Truth expands Himself into the guëävatäras, or incarnations who carry out the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the universe through the modes of passion, goodness and ignorance respectively."

            "content": "It is significant here that although this verse mentions creation through the material mode of passion and annihilation through the material mode of ignorance, it does not mention maintenance by Viñëu through the material mode of goodness. That is because Viñëu is viçuddha-sattva, or existing on the platform of unlimited transcendental goodness. Although Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä are somewhat affected by their prescribed duties as superintendents of the modes of nature, Lord Viñëu is viçuddha-sattva, completely beyond contamination even by the material mode of goodness. As described in the Vedas, na tasya käryaà karaëaà ca vidyate: the Lord has no occupational duty. Whereas Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä are understood to be servants of the Lord, Viñëu is completely transcendental."

            "content": "According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, Viñëu, described in this verse as kratu-patiù, the Lord of sacrifice, is understood to have appeared in a previous age as the incarnation Suyajïa, the son of Prajäpati Ruci. Whereas Brahmä and Çiva faithfully engage in service to the Supreme Lord, Viñëu is the Supreme Lord Himself, and therefore His activities of maintaining the brähmaëas and religious principles, as mentioned in this verse (dvija-dharma-setuù), are not occupational duties but lélä. So in addition to being a guëävatära, Viñëu is also a lélävatära, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé. The Mahäbhärata (Çänti-parva) describes the birth of Lord Brahmä from the lotus flower emanating from Viñëu and the subsequent birth of Lord Çiva from the angry eyes of Lord Brahmä. Viñëu, however, is the self-manifested Personality of Godhead who enters the material universe by His own internal potency, as stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

Still, that same eternal Lord manifests Himself as Brahmä and Çiva in the sense that the primeval controllers Brahmä and Çiva manifest the potency and supreme will of the Lord, although they themselves are not supreme."
