    "translation": "Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi, who is perfectly peaceful and is the best of sages, was born as the son of Dharma and his wife Mürti, the daughter of Dakña. Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi taught the devotional service of the Lord, by which material work ceases, and He Himself perfectly practiced this knowledge. He is living even today, His lotus feet served by the greatest of saintly persons.",

            "content": "It is understood that Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi spoke transcendental knowledge to great saintly persons such as Närada Muni. On the basis of these teachings, Närada was able to describe naiñkarmyam, or the devotional service of the Lord, which eradicates material work, as mentioned in Çrémad-Bhägavatam . The process of transforming ordinary karma into naiñkarmya, or transcendental work, is summarized by Çréla Prabhupäda in his commentary on this verse spoken by Närada Muni. \"Fruitive work, in which almost all people in general are engaged, is always painful either in the beginning or at the end. It can be fruitful only when made subservient to the devotional service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gétä also it is confirmed that the result of such fruitive work may be offered for the service of the Lord, otherwise it leads to material bondage. The bona fide enjoyer of the fruitive work is the Personality of Godhead, and thus when it is engaged for the sense gratification of the living beings, it becomes an acute source of trouble.\" According to the Matsya Puräëa (3.10), Dharma, the father of Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi, was born from the right breast of Brahmä and later married thirteen of the daughters of Prajäpati Dakña. The Lord Himself appeared from the womb of Mürti-devé."
