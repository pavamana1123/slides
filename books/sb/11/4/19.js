    "translation": "The Lord also delivered the tiny ascetic sages called the Välakhilyas when they fell into the water in a cow's hoofprint and Indra was laughing at them. The Lord then saved Indra when Indra was covered by darkness due to the sinful reaction for killing Våträsura. When the wives of the demigods were trapped in the palace of the demons without any shelter, the Lord saved them. In His incarnation as Nåsiàha, the Lord killed Hiraëyakaçipu, the king of demons, to free the saintly devotees from fear.",
