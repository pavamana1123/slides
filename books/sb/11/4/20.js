    "translation": "The Supreme Lord regularly takes advantage of the wars between the demons and demigods to kill the leaders of the demons. The Lord thus encourages the demigods by protecting the universe through His various incarnations during the reigns of each Manu. The Lord also appeared as Vämana and took the earth away from Bali Mahäräja on the plea of begging three steps of land. The Lord then returned the entire world to the sons of Aditi.",
