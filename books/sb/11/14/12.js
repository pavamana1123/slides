The word viñayätmanäm includes those who are cultivating material peace of mind, self-control and speculative philosophy. But even if such persons rise to the platform of sattva-guëa, the mode of goodness, they do not attain perfection, because sattva-guëa, being material, is also part and parcel of mäyä, or illusion. As stated by Çré Närada Muni,"

Indeed, no so-called materially auspicious process can induce the Lord to reveal Himself.\"  According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, one enjoys the happiness spoken of in this verse while associating, in one's own spiritual body, with the supreme transcendental form of the Lord. The Lord's transcendental form is filled with infinite, wonderful qualities, and the happiness of being with the Lord is unlimited. Unfortunately, materialistic people cannot possibly imagine such happiness, since they are not at all inclined to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
