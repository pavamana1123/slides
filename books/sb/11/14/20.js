Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé states, jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam:  a devotee should simply depend on Kåñëa and should not unnecessarily complicate his loving service with tendencies toward fruitive work or mental speculation. The residents of Våndävana simply depend on Lord Kåñëa. When the great serpent Aghäsura appeared in the precincts of Vraja, the cowherd boys, completely confident in their friendship with Lord Kåñëa, fearlessly marched into the serpent's gigantic mouth. Such pure love for Kåñëa brings the Lord under the control of the devotee."
