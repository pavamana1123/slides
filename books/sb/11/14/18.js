But even though one's senses are not fully conquered, one who has unflinching devotion for Lord Kåñëa does not run the risk of being separated from Him. The words pragalbhayä bhaktyä indicate a person who has great devotion for Lord Kåñëa, and not one who desires to commit sinful activities and chant Hare Kåñëa to avoid the reaction. Because of previous bad habits and immaturity, even a sincere devotee may be harassed by lingering attraction to the bodily concept of life; but his unflinching devotion for Lord Kåñëa will act. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura gives the following two examples. A great warrior may be struck by the weapon of his enemy, but because of his courage and strength he is not killed or defeated. He accepts the blow and goes on to victory. Similarly, one may contract a serious disease, but if he takes the proper medicine he is quickly cured."

A devotee, however, even though immature, never falls from the path of devotional service. Even if he displays occasional weakness, he is still considered a devotee if his devotion to Lord Kåñëa is very strong. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-gétä :"
