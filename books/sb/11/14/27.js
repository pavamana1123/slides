Lord Kåñëa states here that one must endeavor constantly to keep the Lord within one's mind. Anusmarataù, or constant remembrance, is possible for one who always chants and hears the glories of Lord Kåñëa. It is therefore stated, çravaëam, kértanam , smaraëam: the process of devotional service begins with hearing (çravaëam) and chanting (kértanam), from which remembrance (smaraëam) develops. One who constantly thinks of the objects of material gratification becomes attached to them; similarly, one who constantly keeps Lord Kåñëa within his mind becomes absorbed in the Lord's transcendental nature and thus becomes qualified to render personal service to the Lord in His own abode."
