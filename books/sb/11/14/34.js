    "synonyms": "hådi—in the heart; avicchinnam—uninterrupted, continuous; oàkäram—the sacred vibration oà; ghaëöä—like a bell; nädam—sound; bisa-ürëa-vat—like the fiber running up the lotus stalk; präëena—by the wind of präëa; udérya—pushing upward; tatra—therein (at a distance of twelve thumb-breadths); atha—thus; punaù—again; saàveçayet—one should join together; svaram—the fifteen vibrations produced with anusvära.",
    "translation": "Beginning from the mülädhära-cakra, one should move the life air continuously upward like the fibers in the lotus stalk until one reaches the heart, where the sacred syllable oà is situated like the sound of a bell. One should thus continue raising the sacred syllable upward the distance of twelve aìgulas, and there the oàkära should be joined together with the fifteen vibrations produced with anusvära.",

            "content": "It appears that the yoga system is somewhat technical and difficult to perform. Anusvära refers to a nasal vibration pronounced after the fifteen Sanskrit vowels. The complete explanation of this process is extremely complicated and obviously unsuitable for this age. From this description we can appreciate the sophisticated achievements of those who in former ages practiced mystic meditation. Despite such appreciation, however, we should stick firmly to the simple, foolproof method of meditation prescribed for the present age, the chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare R ama, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare."
