    "synonyms": "yathä yathä—as much as; ätmä—the spirit soul, the conscious entity; parimåjyate—is cleansed of material contamination; asau—he; mat-puëya-gäthä—the pious narrations of My glories; çravaëa—by hearing; abhidhänaiù—and by chanting; tathä tathä—exactly in that proportion; paçyati—he sees; vastu—the Absolute Truth; sükñmam—subtle, being nonmaterial; cakñuù—the eye; yathä—just as; eva—certainly; aïjana—with medicinal ointment; samprayuktam—treated.",
    "translation": "When a diseased eye is treated with medicinal ointment it gradually recovers its power to see. Similarly, as a conscious living entity cleanses himself of material contamination by hearing and chanting the pious narrations of My glories, he regains his ability to see Me, the Absolute Truth, in My subtle spiritual form.",

            "content": "The Lord is called sükñmam because He is pure spiritual consciousness, without any tinge of material energy. If one chants and hears the holy name and glories of Kåñëa with great sincerity, there is immediately a transcendental effect. We can immediately see the spiritual world and pastimes of the Lord if we fully surrender to the process mentioned here. A blind person feels perpetual gratitude to a doctor who restores his sight. Similarly, we sing cakñu-däna dila ye, janme janme prabhu sei: the bona fide spiritual master, the representative of Lord Kåñëa, restores our spiritual sight, and thus he is our eternal lord and master."
