These sublime perceptions are certainly due to the causeless mercy of Lord Kåñëa upon one whose mind and senses are completely satisfied in Him. Such a person finds only happiness wherever he goes. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura gives the example that when a very wealthy man travels all over the world, at every place he stays he always enjoys the same luxurious standard of comfort. Similarly, one who has developed Kåñëa consciousness is never separated from happiness, because Lord Kåñëa is all-pervading. The word kiïcana indicates the so-called enjoyable things of this world. One who is akiïcana has correctly understood that material sense gratification is simply the glare of illusion, and therefore such a person is däntasya, or self-controlled, çäntasya, or peaceful, and mayä santuñöa-manasaù, or completely satisfied with his transcendental experience of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
