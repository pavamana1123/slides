            "content": "The Lord has described in the previous verses the unalloyed love of His pure devotees for Him, and now the Lord describes His love for His devotees. Ätma-yoni means Lord Brahmä, who is born directly from the Lord's body. Lord Çiva always gives great pleasure to Lord Kåñëa by his constant meditation upon Him, and Saìkarñaëa, or Balaräma, is the Lord's brother in kåñëa-lélä. The goddess of fortune is the Lord's wife, and the word ätmä here indicates the Lord's own self as the Deity. None of these personalities—even the Lord's own self—are as dear to Him as His pure devotee Uddhava, an akiïcana devotee of the Lord. Çréla Madhväcärya cites from Vedic literature the example that a gentleman sometimes neglects his own interest and that of his children to give charity to a poor beggar. Similarly, the Lord gives preference to a helpless devotee who depends completely on His mercy. The only way to obtain the Lord's mercy is through His causeless love, and the Lord is most lovingly inclined toward those devotees who are most dependent on Him, just as ordinary mothers and fathers worry more about their helpless children than about those who are self-sufficient. Thus even if one lacks any material qualification, one should simply depend upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without any other interest, and surely one will achieve the highest perfection of life."
