            "content": "Lord Kåñëa explains to Uddhava that although many processes and concepts of spiritual realization are described in the Vedas, the Vedas ultimately recommend devotional service to the Supreme Lord. Lord Kåñëa is the reservoir of all pleasure, and His devotees directly enter into the Lord's hlädiné, or pleasure-giving, potency. Somehow or other one must fix one's mind in Lord Kåñëa, and that is not possible without devotional service. One who has not developed his attraction to Lord Kåñëa cannot restrain the senses from inferior engagements. Since other Vedic processes do not actually award Lord Kåñëa to the practitioner, they cannot offer the highest benefit in life. The transcendental sound of the Vedas is itself the highest evidence, but one whose senses and mind are entangled in sense gratification and mental speculation, and whose heart is therefore covered by material dust, cannot directly receive the transcendental Vedic message. Thus one cannot appreciate the exalted position of devotional service to the Lord."
