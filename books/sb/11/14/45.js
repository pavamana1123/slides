    "translation": "One who has completely fixed his mind on Me should see Me within his own soul and should see the individual soul within Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, he sees the individual souls united with the Supreme Soul, just as one sees the sun's rays completely united with the sun.",

Thus when one sees the individual soul as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the experience can be compared to seeing the sun's rays emanating from the sun. The Supreme Lord is within the living entity, and simultaneously the living entity is within the Lord. But in both cases the Supreme Lord, and not the living entity, is the maintainer and controller. How happy everyone could be by taking to Kåñëa consciousness and finding the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, within everything and everything within Kåñëa. Liberated life in Kåñëa consciousness is so pleasurable that the greatest misfortune is to be without such consciousness. Çré Kåñëa is kindly explaining in many different ways the supremacy of Kåñëa consciousness, and fortunate persons will understand the sincere message of the Lord."
