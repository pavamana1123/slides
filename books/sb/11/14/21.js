Jäti-doña does not refer to mundane social, economic or professional status, but rather to one's degree of spiritual enlightenment. All around the world, many people are born into rich and powerful families, but they often acquire abominable habits that are part of their so-called family tradition. However, even unfortunate persons who are taught from birth to engage in sinful activities can at once be purified by the potency of pure devotional service. Such service must have Lord Kåñëa as the only goal (man-niñöhä), must be rendered with full faith (çraddhayä), and must be unalloyed, or without any selfish motivation (ekayä)."
