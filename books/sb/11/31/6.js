The demigods similarly employ this mystic fire when being transferred to the spiritual world. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely different from conditioned souls like yogés and demigods, since the Lord's eternal, spiritual body is the source of all existence, as indicated here by the words lokäbhirämäà sva-tanum. Lord Kåñëa's body is the source of pleasure for the entire universe. The word dhäraëä-dhyäna-maìgalam indicates that those trying for spiritual elevation through meditation and yoga achieve all auspiciousness through meditation on the Lord's body. Since yogés are liberated simply by thinking of Lord Kåñëa's body, that body is certainly not material and therefore not subject to burning by mundane mystic fire or any other type of fire."

            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura reminds us of Lord Kåñëa's statement in the Eleventh Canto, : vahni-madhye smared rüpaà mamaitad dhyäna-maìgalam. \"Within the fire one should meditate upon My form, which is the auspicious object of all meditation.\" Since Lord Kåñëa's transcendental form is present within fire as the maintaining principle, how can fire affect that form? Thus although the Lord appeared to enter the mystic yoga trance, the word adagdhvä indicates that the Lord, since His body is purely spiritual, bypassed the formality of burning and directly entered His own abode in the spiritual sky. This point has also been elaborately explained by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé in his commentary to this verse."
