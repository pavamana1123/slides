    "translation": "Although Lord Kåñëa, being the possessor of infinite powers, is the only cause of the creation, maintenance and destruction of innumerable living beings, He simply did not desire to keep His body in this world any longer. Thus He revealed the destination of those fixed in the self and demonstrated that this mortal world is of no intrinsic value.",

In other words, as soon as possible one should perfect one's Kåñëa consciousness and go back home, back to Godhead. If Lord Kåñëa had remained longer on the earth, He would have unnecessarily increased the prestige of the material world."
