    "translation": "Lord Kåñëa brought the son of His guru back from the planet of the lord of death in the boy's selfsame body, and as the ultimate giver of protection He saved you also when you were burned by the brahmästra of Açvatthämä. He conquered in battle even Lord Çiva, who deals death to the agents of death, and He sent the hunter Jarä directly to Vaikuëöha in his human body. How could such a personality be unable to protect His own Self?",

            "content": "To mitigate his own and Parékñit Mahäräja's distress at the narration of Lord Kåñëa's departure from this world, Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé here gives several clear examples proving that Lord Kåñëa is far beyond the influence of death. Although the son of Lord Kåñëa's spiritual master (Sändépani Muni) had been taken by death, the Lord brought him back in his same body. Similarly, the power of Brahman cannot touch Lord Kåñëa, since Parékñit Mahäräja, though burned by the brahmästra weapon, was easily saved by the Lord. Lord Çiva was clearly defeated by Lord Kåñëa in the battle with Bäëäsura, and the hunter Jarä was sent to a Vaikuëöha planet in his same human body. Death is an insignificant expansion of Lord Kåñëa's external potency and cannot possibly act upon the Lord Himself. Those who actually understand the transcendental nature of Lord Kåñëa's activities will find convincing evidence in these examples."
