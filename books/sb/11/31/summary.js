All the demigods who, in pursuance of the desire of Lord Kåñëa, had taken birth in the Yadu dynasty to render assistance in His pastimes followed Lord Kåñëa and returned to their respective abodes. The Lord's activities of creating a life for Himself and then dismantling it are simply tricks of Mäyä, like an actor's performance. Actually, He creates the entire universe, and then He enters within it as the Supersoul. In the end, He again winds up the entire universe within Himself and, remaining in His private glory, desists from external pastimes."

Arjuna then carried out the rituals of offering piëòa and so on for his dead relatives. At that time the ocean swallowed up all of Dvärakä-puré except for the Lord's own residence. Arjuna took the remaining members of the Yadu dynasty to Indraprastha, where he installed Vajra upon the throne. Hearing of these events, the Päëòavas, led by Yudhiñöhira, placed Parékñit upon their throne and left for the great journey."
