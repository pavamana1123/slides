Dvärakä had been constructed by Viçvakarmä, the architect of the demigods, and the Sudharmä assembly hall had been brought from heaven. In that city there were many beautiful and splendorous residences of the aristocratic Yadu dynasty, and the most beautiful residence of all was that of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé mentions that even in the modern age, people who live near the site of the original Dvärakä sometimes catch a glimpse of it in the ocean. Ultimately, the Lord's associates and abode are eternal, and one who understands this is qualified to become fully Kåñëa conscious."
