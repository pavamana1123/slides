Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted a verse from the Tantra-bhägavata stating that the reason the four sons of Lord Brahmä, although mahäjanas and experts in the science of devotional service, declined to answer King Nimi was that they wanted to demonstrate clearly that even those who are expert in the cultivation of speculative knowledge cannot understand the actual science of pure devotional service. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has further commented that the sages avoided answering the question from the King because at that time King Nimi was a young boy and therefore not mature enough to understand the answer fully."
