    "translation": "Accepting the bona fide spiritual master as one's life and soul and worshipable deity, the disciple should learn from him the process of pure devotional service. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, the soul of all souls, is inclined to give Himself to His pure devotees. Therefore, the disciple should learn from the spiritual master to serve the Lord without duplicity and in such a faithful and favorable way that the Supreme Lord, being satisfied, will offer Himself to the faithful disciple.",

Lord Vämana was so pleased by the selfless surrender of Bali Mahäräja that the Lord became the doorman in the palace of Bali who was reinstalled as a great leader in the universe."

Although one may experience many seemingly wonderful or important events in a dream, one's real life begins when he wakes up. Similarly, since the spiritual master gives birth to the disciple by awakening him to spiritual life, a bona fide disciple understands that his spiritual master is the very basis of his life."

In this connection there is the following çruti-mantra: änandäd dhémäni bhütäni jäyante. \"Indeed, it is from the all-blissful Supreme that all these creatures have come into being.\" Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has further pointed out that when the Lord bestows His own self upon a pure devotee such a fortunate devotee can actually see the Lord, touch Him and directly engage in His service."

One should see the spiritual master as being always under the shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. One should never try to engage the spiritual master in one's personal service with the mentality of lording it over the spiritual master and attaining through him some material gain. One who is actually advancing will become more and more eager to serve the spiritual master, and thus such a disciple experiences the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Such a transcendental, authorized engagement is called bhägavata-dharma. Within the International Society for Krishna Consciousness there are many thousands of authorized engagements pertaining to the Society's missionary activities. And by hearing the Çrémad-Bhägavatam and performing such engagements the Society's members feel relief from çoka (lamentation), moha (illusion) and bhaya (fear)."

A so-called Vaiñëava who whimsically neglects the strict control of the body, mind and speech cannot actually achieve shelter at the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master. Even if such a whimsical sense enjoyer makes a show of assuming the dress and daëòa of Vaiñëava sannyäsa, he will not attain the desired result, love of Kåñëa. A bona fide Vaiñëava should work earnestly to free himself from any tinge of sense gratification and mental speculation, and with a loving heart he should carry out the orders of his bona fide spiritual master. By always remembering the exalted position of the bona fide spiritual master, the disciple will achieve shelter at the lotus feet of Kåñëa."
