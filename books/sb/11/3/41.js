Çréla Prabhupäda comments on this verse from Bhagavad-gétä as follows: \"It is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be always active. Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of Kåñëa consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the çästras. But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of Kåñëa consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him.\""

            "content": "Ordinary people often question the busy activities of the devotees of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, mistaking such activities to be ordinary material work. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has stated in this connection, kämya-karmäëy eva tyäjitäni, na tu nitya-naimittikäni, phalasyaiva vininditatvät. One should give up selfish activities performed for one's personal sense gratification, since the result of such thoughtless work is further material bondage. But one should offer one's regular or occasional occupational duties to the Supreme Lord, and thus such activities become transcendental devotional service. By the words tasmäd guruà prapadyeta jijïäsuù çreya uttamam , this chapter has clearly explained that dovetailing one's work with the service of the Lord is an art one should learn at the lotus feet of the bona fide spiritual master. Otherwise, if one whimsically declares his materialistic work to be transcendental devotional service, there will be no actual result. Therefore, according to Çré Jéva Gosvämé, one should not mistake the word naiñkarmyam to indicate inactivity; rather, it indicates transcendental activity under the guidance of the Lord and His representative."
