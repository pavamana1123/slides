The word çuciù means that one should be internally and externally clean. Çuciù means that one should perform activities only for the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If somehow or other one can remember the Supreme Lord constantly by chanting and hearing His holy name, one will come to the pure stage of life, as described in this Vedic mantra:"

Therefore the word çuciù here indicates that one should worship the Lord in a favorable frame of mind, considering the Lord to be sacred and one's self to be an insignificant servant of the Lord. Those who are not favorably inclined toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not like to worship the Deity in the temple, and they discourage people from going to the temple of the Lord by saying that since the Lord is omnipresent there is no need to do so. Such envious persons prefer the gymnastic exercises of haöha-yoga or the räja-yoga system. But statements by the Lord Himself, such as väsudevaù sarvam iti and mäà ekaà çaraëaà vraja , indicate that in mature transcendental realization one understands that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the source of everything and therefore the only worshipable object. Thus the devotees who worship the Deity of the Lord according to the païcarätra system are not attracted by any yoga process except bhakti-yoga."
