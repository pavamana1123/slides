    "translation": "Çré Ävirhotra replied: Prescribed duties, nonperformance of such duties, and forbidden activities are topics one can properly understand through authorized study of the Vedic literature. This difficult subject matter can never be understood by mundane speculation. The authorized Vedic literature is the sound incarnation of the Personality of Godhead Himself, and thus Vedic knowledge is perfect. Even the greatest learned scholars are bewildered in their attempts to understand the science of action if they neglect the authority of Vedic knowledge.",

The performance of forbidden activities is called vikarma. Thus karma, akarma and vikarma are established by the authorized explanations of Vedic literature. They cannot be ascertained merely through mundane exercises in logic. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam , vedo näräyaëaù säkñät svayambhür iti çuçruma: \"The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, and are self-born. This we have heard from Yamaräja.\" In the Puruña-sükta (Åg Veda, maëòala 10, sükta 90, mantra 9) it is stated, tasmäd yajïät sarva-huta åcaù sämäni jajïjire/ chandäàsi jajïjire tasmät: \"From Him, Yajïa, came all sacrificial offerings, hymns of invocation and songs of praise. All the mantras of the Vedas come from the Lord.\" All the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are completely transcendental and free from the four defects of conditional life, namely mistakes, illusion, cheating and imperfect senses. So Vedic knowledge, being a plenary manifestation of the Supreme Lord, is similarly infallible and transcendental."

            "content": "In ordinary human discourse one can ascertain the meaning of human words by understanding the intention of the speaker. But since Vedic knowledge is apauruñeya, or transcendental, one can appreciate its purport only by hearing from the standard authorities in the chain of disciplic succession. This process is prescribed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä (evaà paramparä-präptam ). Thus, even highly learned scholars who proudly neglect this simple descending process are certainly bewildered and embarrassed in their hopeless attempt to ascertain the ultimate meaning of Vedic knowledge. The four sons of Lord Brahmä declined to answer the question of King Nimi since at that time the King was a mere child and therefore not capable of seriously surrendering to the process of hearing through disciplic succession. Çréla Madhväcärya has pointed out in this regard, éçvarätmatväd éçvara-viñayatvät. Because the Vedas describe the unlimited Personality of Godhead, Vedic knowledge cannot be approached by mundane methods of comprehension."
