Çréla Jéva Gosvämé comments that sthüla-dhiyaù also indicates so-called pious persons who execute pompous religious ceremonies for material sense gratification rather than trying to prepare themselves to go back home, back to Godhead, by engaging in the loving devotional service of the Lord."

Therefore the King was asking the question for the benefit of those who falsely consider themselves very much learned but in fact are addicted to materialistic fruitive activities, which increasingly entangle them in illusion. In this regard Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has quoted from the Amara-koça dictionary to show that akåtätmabhiù indicates apürëatvam, or one whose life is empty."

One may love Kåñëa by thinking of Him as one's eternal master, one's most intimate friend, one's beloved child or the object of one's conjugal attraction. Of course, such ecstasies should never be confused with ordinary, material emotions, which are perverted reflections of spiritual rasas, or relationships. In the material world we try to relish these same relationships of servitude, friendship, parental love and conjugal love, but the object of such feelings is a temporary material body, which is quickly devastated by the laws of nature. These loving feelings should be directed toward the spiritual body of the Supreme Personality, Kåñëa, who is the reservoir of all beauty and transcendental bliss. One who has not learned the art of directing his love to Kåñëa is apürëa, or one whose life is ultimately empty."

King Nimi, a pure Vaiñëava, was so kind that he asked, \"How can such cripple-minded people cross over mäyä in the easiest way possible, since by nature they are very lazy in spiritual matters?\""
