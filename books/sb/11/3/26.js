If one becomes overwhelmed by mundane unhappiness due to not achieving immediate success in self-realization, or if one becomes deluded by sense gratification and tries to take shelter of materialistic men and doctrines, one's devotional progress will immediately be checked. Similarly, if a devotee expresses love for things separate from Kåñëa or tries to find fault in the process of devotional service or the philosophy of Bhagavad-gétä in order to justify absorbing himself in the sense gratification of seeing things separate from Kåñëa, his progress in spiritual enlightenment will be seriously disturbed. Such an illusory concept is called dvitéyäbhiniveça, or absorption in illusion. On the other hand, if one is attracted to the vibration of Vedic sound by the consensus of self-realized authorities called the vaiñëava-paramparä and thus engages enthusiastically in kåñëa-näma-kértana, or chanting the holy names of the Lord, then one's practice of mauna, or silence, is perfect."

A Vaiñëava should reject the gross sense gratification of living in the forest in the mode of goodness, in the city in the mode of passion, or in the gambling house in ignorance. A pure devotee may travel all over the world distributing Kåñëa consciousness, but he should never consider any material place to be his actual residence.

One is recommended to accept a bona fide spiritual master and serve him according to the direction of these verses. The essence of such instructions is that one should abandon the association of Mäyävädé impersonalists, ritualistic fruitive workers and those who are whimsically indifferent to the ultimate purpose of life, and instead one should devote himself to associating with the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A falsely proud neophyte may imagine himself a great devotee of the Lord without taking to the company of the Lord's followers, but without such association it is not possible to become advanced in Kåñëa consciousness."
