Therefore, in this verse the King is requesting specific information about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa. It is significant in this verse that the King refers to the Supreme Lord as Näräyaëa, Brahman and Paramätmä. Although King Nimi is already understood to be a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by his question he wants to clarify that the Personality of Godhead is the highest transcendental truth.

            "content": "Generally the speculative philosophers become attracted to the impersonal Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth, whereas the mystic yogés meditate upon the Paramätmä, the Supersoul within everyone's heart. On the other hand, those who have achieved mature transcendental knowledge surrender directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän, who is eternally situated in His own abode, called Vaikuëöha-dhäma. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa clearly says, brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham: \"I am the source of the impersonal Brahman.\" Similarly, it is described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam that the Supersoul, Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, is a secondary plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. King Nimi wants the sages to make clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original feature of the Absolute Truth, and therefore he places his question before the next of the nine Yogendras, Pippaläyana."
