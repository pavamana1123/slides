When Lord Viñëu casts His potent glance in the form of käla, or time, material interactions take place, culminating in the variegated creation of the material cosmos. In this verse it is stated that at the end of universal time the same käla that originally incited the female nature into manifestation again withdraws the cosmos into its original state of inert nonmanifestation. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the time potency itself, käla, is then withdrawn, and it merges into the Supreme Soul, who manifests Himself as the original cause of material nature (anädir ädir govindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam (BS 5.1))."

In the spiritual sky the variegated spiritual enjoyment of the Lord and His devotees is not hampered by the inferior cycles of birth, maintenance and destruction found in the material world."
