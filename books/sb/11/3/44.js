    "translation": "Childish and foolish people are attached to materialistic, fruitive activities, although the actual goal of life is to become free from such activities. Therefore, the Vedic injunctions indirectly lead one to the path of ultimate liberation by first prescribing fruitive religious activities, just as a father promises his child candy so that the child will take his medicine.",

Those who perform ritualistic ceremonies or austerities in the mode of goodness are offered the chance for promotion to the higher planetary systems called Svargaloka. Açnanti divyän divi deva-bhogän. Similarly, those who perform karma-käëòa, or fruitive religious activities in the mode of passion, are allowed to become great rulers or wealthy men on earth and enjoy great prestige and earthly power. But as stated in the Manu-saàhitä, pravåttir eñä bhütänäà nivåttis tu mahä-phalä: \"Although fruitive religious activities are very much popular among the conditioned souls, the actual perfection of life is achieved when one gives up all fruitive endeavor.\""

Therefore, the father entices his child by saying, \"I am going to give you a delicious piece of candy. But if you want this candy, first just take this little bit of medicine, and then you can have the candy.\" Such indirect persuasion is called parokña-vädaù, or an indirect description that conceals the actual purpose. The father presents his proposal to the child as if the ultimate goal were to receive the candy and only a minor condition must be fulfilled to receive it. Actually, however, the father's goal is to administer the medicine to the child and cure him of his disease. Thus, describing the primary purpose indirectly and concealing it with a secondary proposal is called parokña-vädaù, or indirect persuasion."

In all Vedic rituals Viñëu is worshiped, and thus one is gradually promoted to the understanding that one's actual self-interest is to surrender to Viñëu. Na te viduù svärtha-gatià hi viñëum )."

Simply by the delightful process of kåñëa-kértana one is freed from his connection to this fallen age (mukta-saìga) and goes back home, back to Godhead (paraà vrajet). Sometimes the preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement also use the parokña, or indirect method of persuasion, offering a nice transcendental sweet to the conditioned soul to entice him to come to the lotus feet of the Lord. Caitanya Mahäprabhu's movement is kevala änanda-käëòa, simply blissful. But by the mercy of Caitanya Mahäprabhu even one who is indirectly attracted to the Kåñëa consciousness movement achieves very quickly the perfection of life and goes back home, back to Godhead."
