    "translation": "The individual living being, the master of the material body, uses his material senses, which have been activated by the Supersoul, to try to enjoy sense objects composed of the three modes of nature. Thus he misidentifies the created material body with the unborn eternal self and becomes entangled in the illusory energy of the Lord.",

            "content": "\"The living entity in the material world carries his various conceptions of life from one body to another as the air carries aromas.\" Çréla Prabhupäda has commented in his purport, \"Here the living entity is described as éçvaraù, the controller of his own body. If he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes he can move to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change his body undergoes depends upon him.\" This statement confirms the words sva-mäträ and ätma-prasiddhaye in  of this chapter. If the Supreme Lord were to interfere with the minute independence of the living entity, there would be no question of the living entity's engaging in the loving service of the Lord, since love implies a spontaneous free choice by the lover. Here the word prabhuù indicates that just as a child, having received a toy car from his father, pedals on the sidewalk, imitating the father, who drives an actual car, the living entity pedals around the material universe in the innumerable material bodies selected for him by the Supreme Lord from an assortment of 8,400,000 species. Thus the living entity, infatuated with the false ego of the material body, creates a fearful situation in which he undergoes repeated birth and death, as described in the statement bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syät ."
