This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä (vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù ). The majority of human beings are not able to suddenly give up material sense gratification, even though they understand from Vedic literature that such sense gratification causes a pernicious future effect. We have practical experience in the Western countries that when the government informed the citizens that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, most people were unable to give up their smoking habit. Therefore, the Vedic literature prescribes a gradual process of purification in which the conditioned soul learns to offer the results of his material activities to the Supreme Lord, thus spiritualizing those activities. Material sense gratification is based on two organs, namely the tongue for tasting and the genitals for sex life. By offering palatable food to the Deity of Kåñëa and then enjoying the remnants as kåñëa-prasädam and by accepting the rules and regulations for Vedic householder life and begetting of Kåñëa conscious children, one can gradually bring the full range of material activities to the platform of pure devotional service. By offering the fruits of one's ordinary activities to the Supreme Lord, one gradually understands that the Lord Himself, and not material sense gratification, is the actual goal of life. Lord Kåñëa warns in Bhagavad-gétä that if people are prematurely encouraged to give up householder life or the sumptuous remnants of the Lord's prasädam, such artificial renunciation will have the opposite effect."

The example is given that a child may be offered candy-covered medicine. The child becomes enthusiastic to take the medicine because of the candy coating, whereas a mature person will be enthusiastic to take the medicine itself, knowing that such medicine is meant for his real self-interest. The mature platform of Vedic understanding is mentioned in the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (4.4.22): tam etaà vedänuvacanena brähmaëä vividiñanti brahmacaryeëa tapasä çraddhayä yajïenänäçakena ca. \"By the teaching of the Vedas and by celibacy, penances, faith and controlled eating, great brähmaëas come to know the Supreme.\" The Supreme is Kåñëa, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä. Although the prescribed rituals of the Vedas may sometimes resemble material fruitive work, the activity is spiritualized because the result is offered to the Supreme. Candy-covered medicine and ordinary candy may appear or taste the same. But the candy-covered medicine has a therapeutic effect not found in ordinary candy. Similarly, the words naiñkarmyaà labhate siddhim in this verse indicate that a faithful follower of the Vedic injunctions will gradually be promoted to the highest perfection of life, pure love of Godhead, as stated by Caitanya Mahäprabhu (premä pum-artho mahän)."
