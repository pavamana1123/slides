Thus he should learn to deal properly with all living beings.",

According to Bhagavad-gétä, traiguëya-viñayä vedäù: the varëäçrama culture described in Vedic literature deals mostly with the living entities who are struggling within the three modes of nature. The Vedic literatures teach such conditioned souls that material happiness can be achieved only through pious works. In this sense, the demigods are to be considered the most pious living entities within the three modes of material nature. The åñis, or the great saintly mystics of the universe, who are able to travel at will to various planets and who cultivate mystic powers, are to be considered somewhat below the demigods. And those human beings on earth who perfectly execute the Vedic rituals are to be considered in the third or lowest category of santaù, or saintly persons. But a devotee of the Lord is beyond the three modes of material nature. Lord Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä ,"

            "content": "\"One cannot be liberated without association with a pure devotee of the Lord. And unless one shows mercy to those in an inferior position, one's life will be superficial.\" It is our practical experience in the Kåñëa consciousness movement that those who are expanding their mercy by preaching the message of Kåñëa are making rapid spiritual progress, and their life is filled with transcendental bliss. Those who neglect the quality of mercy, being uninterested in the missionary activities of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, are not filled with transcendental pleasure as described here by the word püryate. Not being filled with spiritual pleasure, surely such persons attempt to fill their lives with material pleasure through sense gratification and mental speculation, associating with women or reading innumerable mundane novels, newspapers, newsmagazines, and so on. According to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu the preaching activities of the Kåñëa consciousness movement are änandämbudhi-vardhanam, the ever-increasing ocean of bliss. Missionary activities are based on the principle of dayäm, or mercy to those who are fallen. Those who are actually preaching become enlivened by associating with other preachers. This principle is called maitrém, or friendship among equals. The power to carry out such preaching activities, as well as the proper guidance for distributing Kåñëa's message, comes through the principle of praçrayam, or humble service at the lotus feet of spiritual authorities such as the spiritual master. If one preaches Kåñëa consciousness sincerely under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master and in the company of fellow preachers, one is perfectly fulfilling the statement of this verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and thus he will come to the point of sarvato manaso 'saìgam, or complete detachment from the illusory energy of the Lord. Caitanya Mahäprabhu has stated, lava-mätra sädhu-saìge sarva-siddhi haya . By becoming attached to the devotees of the Lord, one will achieve all perfection in life, going back home, back to Godhead."

One who ignores his eternal status as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and who instead covers himself more and more with material illusions in the form of temporary designations—\"I am American,\" \"I am Russian,\" \"I am Indian,\" \"I am black,\" \"I am white\" and so on—is certainly a killer of his own soul and cannot be considered merciful. Similarly, those who support animal slaughter by eating meat, fish and eggs cannot be considered merciful. Sometimes the argument is given that if one does not harm others he is perfectly religious. But because we are now in a state of ignorance, we have no idea whatsoever of the future reactions to our present activities. Ignorantly boasting that one is not harming others, without an awareness of the subtle laws of nature, does not make one a religious person. One becomes religious by surrendering to the laws of God as they are stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä. As long as a living entity is infatuated with his own mental speculations, which carry him away like the waves of the ocean, he cannot understand the process of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mental speculations based on our experience of the variegated creations of the Lord's illusory energy are incapable of bringing us to perfect knowledge. One must give up materialistic association and make company with pure devotees of the Lord, those who are engaged twenty-four hours a day in perfectly pleasing the Supreme Lord."

One's advancement can be measured by one's detachment from sense gratification and his ability to distribute Kåñëa consciousness to others. In this connection Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura has said, chäòiyä vaiñëava-sevä, nistära päyeche kebä: \"Who can attain salvation if he gives up the service of the Vaiñëavas?\" By serving the lotus feet of pure devotees, one is immediately enlightened with spiritual knowledge. All of the so-called pleasures of the material world, culminating in many varieties of sexual fantasy and impersonal visions of oneself as God, become useless to one who has achieved the mercy of the lotus feet of a pure devotee of Kåñëa. The entire material creation is compared to an insignificant bubble in the ocean. The material universe rests on the spiritual potency of the Lord called brahmajyoti, just as an insignificant bubble rests on the potency of the unlimited ocean. By serving the lotus feet of a pure devotee one can enter the ocean of eternal happiness and experience his constitutional position as a servant of Kåñëa. The mercy of the Vaiñëavas is unlimited, and one who has tasted that mercy becomes mad after the lotus feet of Kåñëa, not caring for the hallucinations of so-called material pleasure or mental speculation. The mercy of the Vaiñëavas is substantial and as powerful as Kåñëa Himself, whereas impersonal speculations and hopeless dreams of society, friendship and love merely constitute various means by which mäyä cheats the conditioned souls and keeps them in perpetual frustration."
