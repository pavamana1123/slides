Indeed, such a person has already rejected the Supreme Lord, Hari.\" The bona fide disciple should always remember that his entire understanding of Vedic knowledge is coming through the mercy of his bona fide spiritual master. If one superficially or whimsically accepts and rejects a bona fide Vaiñëava spiritual master, sometimes becoming attracted to another spiritual master, one commits a vaiñëava-aparädha, a great offense against the devotees of the Lord. Sometimes a foolish neophyte mistakenly thinks that the relationship with the spiritual master is meant for the sense gratification of the disciple, and therefore in the name of spiritual aspirations such a fool gives up a bona fide Vaiñëava guru. One should understand oneself to be the eternal servant of the guru. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, however, has quoted this verse from the Närada-païcarätra:"

            "content": "One should not artificially try to assimilate all of the apparently conflicting branches of Vedic knowledge. Vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù . Conditioned souls have various conflicting natures, which are engaged by apparently conflicting Vedic injunctions called pravåtti and nivåtti-märga. But the easiest path is simply to learn the process of regularly worshiping advaya-jïäna, Lord Viñëu. All the demigods mentioned in the Vedas are paraphernalia for the service of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu. Whatever exists in the visible material world is also meant to be engaged in the Lord's service; otherwise, it has no value. If one artificially renounces material things useful in the service of the Supreme Lord, he loses his spiritual qualification of seeing everything as meant for Kåñëa's pleasure and will be forced to think of material objects as meant for his own sense enjoyment. In other words, material things should be accepted or rejected according to the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, one will fall down from the standard of pure devotional service. As stated in this verse, labdhvänugraha äcäryät: such discrimination can be learned when one receives the mercy of a bona fide spiritual master, who reveals to the sincere disciple the practical application of Vedic knowledge."
