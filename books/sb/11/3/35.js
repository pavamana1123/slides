    "translation": "Çré Pippaläyana said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of the creation, maintenance and destruction of this universe, yet He has no prior cause. He pervades the various states of wakefulness, dreaming and unconscious deep sleep and also exists beyond them. By entering the body of every living being as the Supersoul, He enlivens the body, senses, life airs and mental activities, and thus all the subtle and gross organs of the body begin their functions. My dear King, know that Personality of Godhead to be the Supreme.",

Now the sage Çré Pippaläyana explains these three features of the Absolute Truth in the same order in which the King mentioned them. Sthity-udbhava-pralaya-hetuù refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who expands Himself as the triple puruña incarnations-Mahä-Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu.

            "content": "\"In the beginning of the creation, the Lord first expanded Himself in the universal form of the puruña incarnation and manifested all the ingredients for the material creation. And thus at first there was the creation of the sixteen principles of material action. This was for the purpose of creating the material universe.\" Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, is mentioned here as hetuù, or the supreme cause of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the cosmic situation. Still, there is no cause of the Lord Himself; He is ahetuù. As expressed in the Brahma-saàhitä, anädir ädir govindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam (BS 5.1). The Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes, and being the eternal Absolute Truth, He has no cause of Himself. The word ahetuù has also been explained by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé to indicate that the Supreme Lord has His original form as Kåñëa in His own transcendental abode, called Kåñëaloka. Since Kåñëa is always engaged in His blissful pastimes in the company of His eternally liberated associates, He is aloof from the affairs of this world, which is created by His external potency, known as mäyä. Therefore it is stated, jagåhe pauruñaà rüpam. The Lord expands Himself as Näräyaëa and Viñëu to facilitate the gross illusion and gradual rectification of the conditioned souls. The Lord's aloofness from the material creation is also described in the Vedas: na tasya käryaà karaëaà ca vidyate. The Absolute Truth has nothing to do, since everything is done self-sufficiently by His multipotencies. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that even though the Supreme Lord Kåñëa is ahetuù, or causeless and aloof from the cause of material creation, the Lord is also described in this verse as hetuù, or the ultimate cause of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material manifestation, because He expands Himself as Paramätmä, or the Supersoul, who acts as the prime mover of the cosmic manifestation."

King Nimi inquired about Brahman, and now this verse says, yat svapna-jägara-susuptiñu sad bahiç ca. The Lord's all-pervading feature within wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep, and His existence beyond these three mental states, are understood to be manifestations of Brahman, the spiritual potency of the Lord. Finally, the statement dehendriyäsu-hådayäëi caranti yena saïjévitäni can be understood to refer to the Paramätmä feature of the Lord. When the Lord expands Himself as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, the third of the three Viñëu features, and enters the heart of every living entity, the gross and subtle organs of the body become enlivened for continuing the chain of fruitive activity called karma."

The Absolute Truth is paramavyoma-nätha, or the Lord of the spiritual sky, who appears as two-armed Çyämasundara, as four-armed, as eight-armed or as having one thousand arms. In each aspect His body is eternal and full of bliss and knowledge (sac-cid-änanda-mürti). He appears on earth as Väsudeva and within the Causal Ocean as Mahä-Viñëu. He lies on the Milk Ocean as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu and rescues His helpless young devotee as Nåsiàhadeva. Appearing as Lord Rämacandra, He acts. as a perfect king. And appearing as Kåñëa He steals the heart of everyone, and especially of young beautiful women. All these features of the Lord are indicated by the word Näräyaëa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the word president indicates not only the official duties of the president but his personal family life and long intimate friendships as well. According to Çrémad-Bhägavatam, kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam ."
