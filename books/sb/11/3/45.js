            "content": "In the previous verse it was stated that although fruitive activities are prescribed in the Vedas, the actual goal of human life is to free oneself from all materialistic activities. Therefore, one may conclude that there is no need to perform the Vedic rituals, which offer regulated sense gratification. But an ignorant person, or, in other words, one who has not understood that he is not the material body but an eternal spiritual soul, part and parcel of Kåñëa, will invariably be unable to control the urges of the material senses. Therefore, if such a materially inclined person neglects the Vedic injunctions that administer regulated sense gratification, he will surely fall down into unregulated sense gratification in päpa, or sinful life. For example, those who are affected by sexual desire are ordered to accept the viväha-yajïa, or religious marriage ceremony. We often see that because of false pride a so-called brahmacäré, or celibate student of Vedic knowledge, rejects the marriage ceremony as mäyä, or material illusion. But if such a celibate student is unable to control his senses he will undoubtedly degrade himself by eventually engaging in illicit sex, which has no connection to Vedic culture. Similarly, a neophyte in Kåñëa consciousness is encouraged to eat kåñëa-prasädam to his full satisfaction. Sometimes an immature practitioner of bhakti-yoga tries to make a show of severe eating habits and eventually falls down into eating unregulated and abominable foodstuffs."

This is also described in the Vedas as follows: måtvä punar måtyum äpadyate ardyamänaù sva-karmabhiù. \"Persons who cause themselves severe pain by their materialistic activities gain no relief at the moment of death, for they are placed again in a situation in which death will occur.\" Therefore, Vedic ritualistic activities such as the wedding ceremony or the relishing of sumptuous yajïa-çiñöa, or food remnants of sacrifice, should not be given up by those whose senses are not yet controlled."

If the child rejects the father's offer, thinking that the candy is unnecessary, the child also misses the opportunity to take the medicine that will cure him. Similarly, if a materialistic person rejects the Vedic injunctions that administer prescribed sense gratification, he will not be purified but instead will be further degraded. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has described a materialistic person as one whose mind and intelligence are not faithfully fixed in the message of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gétä Çré Bhagavän, Lord Kåñëa, gives wonderful explanations to the conditioned souls, represented by Arjuna, concerning the actual goal of life. One who cannot fix his mind on these instructions is to be considered a materialistic person who is inclined toward sinful activities and who must therefore submit himself to the standard Vedic injunctions. Such Vedic injunctions, even though fruitive. are considered puëya, or pious, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, and thus one who strictly performs them will not go to hell. Lord Kåñëa Himself states in the Bhägavatam ,"

            "content": "Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the Vedas prescribe that one rise early in the morning, bathe, and chant the Gäyatré mantra. If one artificially gives up such a disciplined, regulated life, one will gradually become a victim of activities for gross sense gratification, such as eating in restaurants and indulging in illicit connections with women. Thus losing control of his senses, he becomes just like an animal, engaging from the early morning until the night in dangerous activities. Çréla Madhväcärya has commented in this regard, ajïaù sann äcarann api. Although in ignorance, one continues to act, not considering the future result of one's activities. Such indifference to the future result of one's activities is described in Bhagavad-gétä to be a symptom of the mode of ignorance. Just as an intelligent man will not drive his car on a highway if he knows the highway will lead him to danger, an intelligent man will not perform non-Vedic activities if he knows that the ultimate result will be the disaster described here by the words måtyor måtyum upaiti. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has stated that ignorant persons sometimes think that after death one automatically attains everlasting peace. But by the powerful reactions of one's sinful activities one comes to a most unpeaceful condition, for one must suffer hellish miseries in exchange for the meager temporary fruits of material work. Such hellish reactions occur not once but perpetually, as long as one is indifferent to the Vedic injunctions."
