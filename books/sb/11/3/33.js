In the second verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is pointed out, dharmaù projjhita-kaitavo 'tra paramo nirmatsaräëäà satäà/ vedyaà västavam atra vastu çivadaà täpa-trayonmülanam . Every living being should give up his mundane conceptions of life and take full shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. If one carries out this order the Lord automatically provides liberation (mukti). Actual happiness comes from loving God without any tinge of mental speculation or fruitive desire."
