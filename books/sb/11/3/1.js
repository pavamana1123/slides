The forty-eighth verse of the previous chapter stated, viñëor mäyäm idaà paçyan: \"A devotee of Kåñëa should see the entire universe to be the illusory potency of the Lord.\" Therefore King Nimi is now pursuing this subject matter by requesting more detailed information from the saintly Yogendras."

Thus they direct their senses toward research for material knowledge. The subtle celestial senses of the demigods and the gross senses of human beings are all busy in ascertaining the measurements of material sense objects. To understand fully the actual nature of mäyä, the illusory potency, which causes the conditioned souls to become averse to Kåñëa consciousness and surrender to bewildering material manifestations, King Nimi is inquiring from another of the nine Yogendras, Çré Antarékña."
