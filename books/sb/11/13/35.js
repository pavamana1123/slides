    "translation": "Having understood the temporary illusory nature of material things, and thus having pulled one's vision away from illusion, one should remain without material desires. By experiencing the happiness of the soul, one should give up material speaking and activities. If sometimes one must observe the material world, one should remember that it is not ultimate reality and therefore one has given it up. By such constant remembrance up till the time of death, one will not again fall into illusion.",

In these and other ways, one will sometimes be forced to deal with the material world and the physical aspects of one's own body. At such times one should remember that the material world is not actual reality and that therefore one has given it up to become Kåñëa conscious. By such constant remembrance, by enjoying spiritual bliss within oneself and by retiring from any material activities of the mind, speech or body, one will not fall into material illusion."

Rather, one should search out spiritual bliss through devotional service to the Supreme Lord. By reviving one's relationship with Lord Kåñëa, one will understand that if one accepts any material object for one's personal enjoyment, attachment will inevitably develop, and thus one will be bewildered by illusion. By gradually developing one's spiritual body, one will no longer desire to enjoy anything within the material world.\""
