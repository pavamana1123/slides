    "synonyms": "dehaù—the body; api—even; daiva—of the Supreme; vaça-gaù—under the control; khalu—indeed; karma—the chain of fruitive activities; yävat—as long as; sva-ärambhakam—that which initiates or perpetuates itself; pratisamékñate—goes on living and waiting; eva—certainly; sa-asuù—along with the vital air and senses; tam—that (body); sa-prapaïcam—with its variety of manifestations; adhirüòha—highly situated; samädhi—the stage of perfection; yogaù—in the yoga system; sväpnam—just like a dream; punaù—again; na bhajate—does not worship or cultivate; pratibuddha—one who is enlightened; vastuù—in the supreme reality.",
    "translation": "The material body certainly moves under the control of supreme destiny and therefore must continue to live along with the senses and vital air as long as one's karma is in effect. A self-realized soul, however, who is awakened to the absolute reality and who is thus highly situated in the perfect stage of yoga, will never again surrender to the material body and its manifold manifestations, knowing it to be just like a body visualized in a dream.",

            "content": "Although Lord Kåñëa recommended in the previous verse that a self-realized soul not give attention to the body, it is clear from the Lord's statement here that one should not foolishly starve or injure the body, but should patiently wait until the chain of one's previous fruitive work has completely exhausted itself. At that time the body will automatically die according to destiny. The following doubt may then arise: If a Kåñëa conscious person pays proper attention to the maintenance of the body, is there danger of again becoming attached to it? Lord Kåñëa here states that one who is highly elevated in Kåñëa consciousness, having understood Lord Kåñëa to be the actual vastu, or reality, never again surrenders to the illusory identification with the material body, which is just like the body seen in a dream."
