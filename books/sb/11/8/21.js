    "translation": "Although one may conquer all of the other senses, as long as the tongue is not conquered it cannot be said that one has controlled his senses. However, if one is able to control the tongue, then one is understood to be in full control of all the senses.",

Therefore, by all means one must control the tongue. If one fasts, then all of the other senses become weak and lose their potency. The tongue, however, becomes more greedy to taste delicious preparations, and when one finally indulges the tongue, all of the senses quickly go out of control. Therefore, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura advises that one accept mahä-prasädam, or the remnants of the Lord's food, in a moderate proportion. Since the tongue's function is also to vibrate, one should vibrate the glorious holy name of the Supreme Lord and taste the ecstasy of pure Kåñëa consciousness. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, rasa-varjaà raso 'py asya paraà dåñövä nivartate:  only by the higher taste of Kåñëa consciousness can one give up the deadly lower taste that keeps one imprisoned in material bondage."

            "content": "Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura states that as long as one's intelligence is materially covered, one cannot understand the pleasure of Kåñëa consciousness. Trying to enjoy without Kåñëa, the living entity leaves the abode of the Supreme Lord, called Vrajabhümi, and comes down into the material world, where he quickly loses control of his senses. One becomes particularly victimized by the tongue, belly and genitals, which exert intolerable pressure on the conditioned soul. These desires subside, however, when one reestablishes one's blissful relationship with the Lord, who is actually the reservoir of all pleasure. One who is attached to the taste of Kåñëa consciousness automatically follows all of the rules and regulations of religious life due to spontaneous attraction to viçuddha-sattva, or the mode of pure goodness. Without such spontaneous attraction, one is certainly bewildered by the pushing of the material senses."

Thus one is delivered from the bondage of material addiction and can no longer be cheated by the allurements of the material energy. As it is said, all that glitters is not gold. In this regard Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura recommends that we consider the following song written by his father, Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura:"

But You, dear Kåñëa, are very kind to us and have given us such nice prasädam, just to control the tongue.
