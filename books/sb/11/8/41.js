One may question who has authorized this lady to reject even such exalted personalities as Brahmä, Çiva and the other demigods. The answer given here is that if one actually wants to solve all the problems of life and go back home, back to Godhead, then the only solution is to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. It is well known that the demigods themselves are subject to birth and death. As stated by Lord Çiva himself, mukti-pradätä sarveñäà viñëur eva na saàçayaù: \"There is no doubt that Viñëu is the deliverer of liberation for everyone.\""
