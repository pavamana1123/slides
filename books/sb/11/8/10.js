As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù. From the honeybee, an intelligent human being should learn to take the essence, or nectar, of all knowledge. A honeybee does not waste its time trying to carry away an entire bush or garden, but rather takes the essential nectar. We may thus study the difference between the honeybee and the ass, who carries heavy loads. Education does not mean to become an intellectual ass carrying heavy loads of useless knowledge; rather, one should accept the essential knowledge that leads to an eternal life of bliss and understanding."

Such complacent, dogmatic, sectarian religionists can certainly learn something from the example of the honeybee given in this verse."
