Mågé Åñi thought that if his son were never exposed to the sight of women he would always remain a perfect brahmacäré. But by chance the inhabitants of the neighboring kingdom, who were suffering from a long-term drought, received divine advice that rain would return to their kingdom only after the brähmaëa named Åñyaçåìga stepped foot in it. Therefore they sent beautiful women to the hermitage of Mågé to entice Åñyaçåìga and bring him back with them. Since Åñyaçåìga had never even heard about women, he easily fell for their trap."

            "content": "The name Åñyaçåìga indicates that the young sage was born with a deerlike horn growing out of his forehead. If like the deer a åñi becomes attracted to sweet musical sounds promising sense gratification, then like the deer he is quickly vanquished. A thoughtful person should humbly take instruction from the deer, who is doomed by attraction to musical sense gratification."
