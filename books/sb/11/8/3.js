In this way, God is mercifully making me humble.\" The word çayéta means one should remain peaceful and patient without mental agitation. Diñöa-bhuk means one must accept the Personality of Godhead as the supreme controller and not foolishly give up one's faith due to material inconvenience. Tat te 'nukampäà su-samékñamäëo bhuïjäna evätma-kåtaà vipäkam . A devotee of the Lord always accepts material hardship as the mercy of Lord Kåñëa; thus he becomes eligible for supreme liberation."
