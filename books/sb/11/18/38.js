Now Lord Kåñëa discusses the situation of one who, desiring self-realization, has become detached from material life but lacks perfect knowledge of Kåñëa consciousness. Such a detached person desiring self-realization must approach the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master in Kåñëa consciousness, and then he will quickly come to the standard of perfect understanding. One who is seriously inclined toward spiritual perfection should not hesitate to adopt the regular discipline necessary for achieving the highest perfection in life."
