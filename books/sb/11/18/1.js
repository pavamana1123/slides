A man who has a reasonable expectation of living for one hundred years may adopt the vänaprastha order at the age of fifty, and then at the age of seventy-five he may take sannyäsa for complete renunciation. Since in Kali-yuga very few people live for one hundred years, one should adjust the schedule accordingly. Vänaprastha is intended as a gradual transition from materialistic family life to the stage of complete renunciation."
