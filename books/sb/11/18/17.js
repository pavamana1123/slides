The Vaiñëava sannyäsés accept a staff made of three bamboo rods, signifying dedication of the body, mind and words to the service of the Supreme Lord. Here Lord Kåñëa says that one must first accept these three daëòas, or disciplines (namely control of the voice, body and mind), within oneself. The practice of aniläyäma (or präëäyäma, regulating the life air) is meant to control the mind, and one who always thinks of service to Lord Kåñëa has certainly achieved the perfection of präëäyäma. Merely carrying the three external daëòas without assimilating the internal daëòas of bodily, mental and vocal discipline can never make one an actual Vaiñëava sannyäsé, as explained here by Lord Kåñëa."

A conditioned soul who adopts only the external ornaments of tridaëòé-sannyäsa will not actually be able to control the senses. One who takes sannyäsa for false prestige, making a show of saintliness without actual advancement in kåñëa-kértana, will soon be vanquished by the external energy of the Lord."
