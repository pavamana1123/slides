Being shackled by illusory desires, he is not able to fully control the senses. Actually, one should take shelter of devotional service to Lord Kåñëa twenty-four hours a day, for by such service one remains within the scope of spiritual reality. By chanting and hearing the holy names of the Lord along with the Lord's glories and pastimes, one naturally drifts away from the field of material sense gratification. Good association with Lord Kåñëa and His devotees automatically vanquishes useless material association, and one is able to carry out the Vedic injunctions meant to lift the conditioned soul out of the material field and onto the liberated platform of Kåñëa consciousness. In this regard, Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé states in his Upadeçämåta (4),"

By pure association one gradually understands the name, form, qualities, associates, pastimes and devotional service of Lord Çré Kåñëa, and thus even in this lifetime one can become a resident of the spiritual world. In the association of pure devotees there is no material contamination and no useless discussion, since all pure devotees are fully engaged twenty-four hours a day in the loving service of the Lord. By the influence of such devotees, one develops equal vision (sama-darçana) and sees the realized knowledge of Kåñëa consciousness everywhere. As one begins to understand his eternal relationship with Lord Kåñëa, he becomes ätma-vän, situated in his constitutional position. An advanced Vaiñëava, constantly enjoying the mellows of loving devotional service and carrying out the mission of the Lord on the earth, is ätma-kréòa, one who enjoys life within the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. The advanced devotee remains constantly attracted to the Supreme Lord and His devotees and is therefore ätma-rata, fully satisfied by constant engagement in devotional service. One cannot possibly develop the exalted qualities mentioned here without becoming an unalloyed devotee of Lord Kåñëa. One who is envious of the Lord and His devotees becomes attracted to bad association, gradually loses control of the senses and falls down into the network of impious life. The innumerable varieties of nondevotees are like branches sprouting from the single tree of enviousness of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, and their association should be given up by all means."

Actually, Lord Kåñëa is the only true object of worship for those desiring to experience unlimited beauty and pleasure. By seriously taking to Kåñëa consciousness one can realize the transcendental position of Lord Kåñëa and gradually develop all of the qualities mentioned in this verse."
