All such Vedic rituals, sacrifices, austerities and so forth should be offered to the lotus feet of Lord Çré Kåñëa. They then become the transcendental means for going back home, back to Godhead. In other words, Kåñëa consciousness, or loving service to Lord Çré Kåñëa, is the sum and substance of progressive human life."
