    "translation": "Although most wise, the paramahaàsa should enjoy life like a child, oblivious to honor and dishonor; although most expert, he should behave like a stunted, incompetent person; although most learned, he should speak like an insane person; and although a scholar learned in Vedic regulations, he should behave in an unrestricted manner.",

A self-realized person does not try to please the mass of people, nor does he desire social prestige, since the mission of his life is to remain detached from the material world and to always please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although neglecting ordinary rules and regulations, a paramahaàsa does not ever become sinful or immoral, but rather neglects ritualistic aspects of religious custom, such as dressing in a particular way, performing certain ceremonies or executing specific penances and austerities."

Those who are preaching should try to make Lord Çré Kåñëa popular without trying to advance their personal prestige in the name of missionary progress. A paramahaàsa not engaged in distributing Kåñëa consciousness, however, should have no attachment whatsoever to public opinion."
