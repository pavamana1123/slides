Lord Kåñëa here refers to such great transcendental scholars as the four Kumäras, Çukadeva Gosvämé, Çré Vyäsadeva, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura and Çréla A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda. The Lord similarly states in Bhagavad-gétä ,"

Speculative, impersonal knowledge does not actually purify the heart of the living entity but rather merges him ever deeper into forgetfulness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as a father is always proud of his son's education, similarly, Lord Kåñëa becomes very happy to see the living entities acquiring a sound spiritual education and thus making progress on the way back home, back to Godhead."
