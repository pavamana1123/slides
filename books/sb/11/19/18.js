    "translation": "An intelligent person should see that any material activity is subject to constant transformation and that even on the planet of Lord Brahmä there is thus simply unhappiness. Indeed, a wise man can understand that just as all that he has seen is temporary, similarly, all things within the universe have a beginning and an end.",

Such celestial neighborhoods are not actually experienced on the earth planet, although they are described in the Vedic literatures. One may argue that promotion to material heaven is recommended in the karma-käëòa portion of the Vedas and that although the happiness available there is not eternal, at least for some time one may enjoy life. Lord Kåñëa here states, however, that even on the planet of Lord Brahmä, which is superior to the heavenly planets, there is no happiness whatsoever. Even in the upper planetary systems there is rivalry, envy, irritation, lamentation and ultimately death itself."
