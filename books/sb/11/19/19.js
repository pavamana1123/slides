Anyone who loves the Lord cannot be fully satiated by discussions of devotional service mixed with descriptions of mere Vedic duties and analytic philosophy. The supreme stage of conscious existence is pure love of Kåñëa, and one who is addicted to Lord Kåñëa desires to constantly drink the nectar of such topics. Lord Kåñëa has given an extensive survey of many aspects of human civilization, including the varëäçrama-dharma system and the processes of distinguishing between matter and spirit, renouncing sense gratification, and so forth. Now Uddhava is hankering to hear specifically about pure devotional service to Lord Kåñëa, and the Lord thus turns to that topic."
