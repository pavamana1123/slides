            "content": "Lord Kåñëa, recognizing Uddhava's highly intellectual nature, has repeatedly recommended to him that one should achieve perfection by cultivation of transcendental knowledge. But the Lord has also clearly demonstrated that such knowledge must bring one to the point of loving devotional service to Him, for otherwise it is useless. In this verse Çré Uddhava corroborates Lord Kåñëa's statements that actual happiness is obtained by surrendering to His lotus feet. When the incarnation of Godhead Påthu Mahäräja was crowned, the demigod Väyu presented him with an umbrella that constantly sprayed fine particles of water. The Lord's two lotus feet are similarly compared here to a wonderful umbrella that produces a constant shower of delicious nectar, the bliss of Kåñëa consciousness. Normally, speculative analytic knowledge terminates in an impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth, but the so-called bliss of merging into impersonal spiritual existence can never be compared to the bliss of Kåñëa consciousness, as stated here by Çré Uddhava. Kåñëa consciousness thus automatically constitutes perfect knowledge, since Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate shelter of all living entities. The words abhihatasya and abhivarñät are significant in this verse. Abhihatasya indicates one who is being defeated on all sides by the onslaught of material nature, whereas abhivarñät indicates a downpour of nectar that eliminates all of the problems of material existence. By our intelligence we should look beyond the dull material body and nonsensical material mind to observe the unlimited shower of blissful nectar coming from the two lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa. Then our real good fortune will begin."
