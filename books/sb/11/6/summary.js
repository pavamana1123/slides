Covering the body of Kåñëa with flower garlands from the Nandana gardens of heaven, they praised Him with statements about His transcendental power and qualities."

            "content": "All living entities, beginning with Brahmä, are subordinate to Lord Çré Kåñëa. Kåñëa creates the universe by empowering His expansion Mahä-Viñëu. Although Kåñëa creates, maintains and destroys this world through His material energy, He remains transcendental to the material energy and perfectly self-satisfied. Even in the midst of His sixteen thousand queens, Lord Kåñëa is undisturbed."

            "content": "Performers of fruitive sacrifices and yogés desiring mystic power contemplate the lotus feet of Lord Çré Kåñëa to attain their materialistic objectives. But the most elevated devotees, who desire liberation from the bondage of material work, lovingly contemplate the Lord's lotuslike feet because those feet are the fire that destroys all desires for sense gratification. One cannot actually purify the mind by ordinary worship, penance and other such processes. One can purify the mind contaminated by sense gratification only through mature faith in the mode of goodness, which arises by hearing the glories of Kåñëa. Therefore, intelligent persons situated in the varëäçrama system serve the two kinds of holy places: the nectarean rivers of the topics of Kåñëa and the nectarean rivers flowing from the Lord's lotus feet."

            "content": "By incarnating within the Yadu dynasty, Kåñëa performed the highest welfare work for the entire universe by displaying His transcendental pastimes. Simply by hearing and chanting about these pastimes, pious persons in Kali-yuga can definitely cross over the ocean of material illusion. When the Lord had fulfilled the purpose of His descent and the Yadu dynasty was facing imminent destruction from the brähmaëas' curse, the Lord desired to wind up His pastimes. When Brahmä prayed to the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa for the deliverance of himself and all the other demigods, Çré Kåñëa revealed in His reply that after the destruction of the Yadu dynasty He would return to His own abode."

            "content": "Observing terrible disturbances indicating the imminent destruction of the world, Lord Kåñëa called together the wise members of the Yadu dynasty and reminded them of the brähmaëas' curse. The Lord convinced them to go to Prabhäsa-tértha, where they could save themselves by the performance of ritual bathing, charity, and so on. The Yadus, in obedience to Kåñëa's desire, prepared to journey to Prabhäsa."

He begged Kåñëa to carry him to His own abode."

            "type": "normal",
            "content": "If one tastes the nectar of Kåñëa's pastimes with his ears, one loses all hankering for other things. Persons who engage constantly in Kåñëa's service-while eating, sporting, sleeping, sitting, etc.-cannot tolerate separation from Kåñëa. They honor all kinds of remnants from Çré Kåñëa and thus conquer the Lord's illusory energy. Peaceful members of the renounced order attain Brahmaloka after exhaustive and painful exertion, whereas the devotees of the Lord simply discuss Lord Kåñëa among themselves, chant and remember His various pastimes and instructions, and thus automatically cross beyond the insurmountable material energy."
