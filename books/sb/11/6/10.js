    "translation": "Great sages, desiring the highest benefit in life, always cherish Your lotus feet within their hearts, which are melted by love for You. Similarly, Your self-controlled devotees, desiring to cross beyond the material kingdom of heaven to achieve opulence equal to Yours, worship Your lotus feet in the morning, at noon and in the evening. Thus, they meditate upon Your Lordship in Your quadruple expansion. Your lotus feet are just like a blazing fire that burns to ashes all the inauspicious desires for material sense gratification.",

What then can be said of the extraordinary good fortune of the demigods, who were directly seeing Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet? Although we are presently afflicted by innumerable material desires, these desires are temporary. The eternal living entity is meant to experience a loving relationship with the supreme living entity, the Personality of Godhead; and by rendering pure devotional service to the Lord, the heart of the living entity is completely satisfied."

            "content": "The word dhümaketu in this verse indicates a flaming comet or fire, which represents Lord Çiva. Lord Çiva is the master of the mode of ignorance, and Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet are compared to the comet, a symbol of the potency of Çiva, which can destroy all ignorance within the heart. The word sama-vibhütaye (\"for achieving equal opulence\") indicates that the pure devotees go back home, back to Godhead, and enjoy the infinite bliss of the spiritual world. Lord Kåñëa is endowed with unlimited opulent paraphernalia for enjoyment, and a liberated soul who goes to Kåñëa's abode is awarded all opulence for serving the Lord. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the word vyühe in this verse indicates the three puruña incarnations, namely Mahä-Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, as well as Väsudeva. If we can scientifically understand how Kåñëa expands Himself to create the material world, we shall immediately experience that everything is the property of Kåñëa and thus become free from the desire to exploit it for our own selfish purposes. Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord, the master of everyone and the reservoir of all opulences, and one should remember His lotus feet in the morning, at noon and in the evening. One who always remembers Kåñëa and never forgets Him will experience real, blissful life beyond the pale shadow of material illusion."
