Therefore the powerful demigods fell down like sticks before the Lord. Such full obeisances (called daëòavat, \"like a stick\") are described as follows:"

Otherwise, the violent waves of sense gratification and mental speculation will undoubtedly sweep one away from one's eternal, constitutional position as the loving servitor of the Supreme Lord, and one will then fall down into the stringent bondage described here as uru-päçät, \"a very powerful illusory network.\""
