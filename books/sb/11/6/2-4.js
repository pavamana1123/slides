            "content": "The Personality of Godhead descends within the material world to assist the demigods in the cosmic management; thus the demigods can normally see such forms of the Lord as Upendra. However, here it is indicated that although accustomed to seeing various Viñëu expansions of the Lord, the demigods were specifically eager to see the most beautiful form of the Lord as Kåñëa. Deha-dehi-vibhägaç ca neçvare vidyate kvacit: there is no distinction between the Supreme Lord and His personal body. The jéva soul is different from his body, but the beautiful, transcendental form of the Lord is identical with the Lord in all respects."
