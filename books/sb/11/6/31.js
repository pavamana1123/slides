In other words, Dvärakä, the Lord's abode, is manifest on the earth, and when the earthly Dvärakä is apparently removed, the eternal Dvärakä in the spiritual world remains as it is. Since the members of the Yadu dynasty are eternal associates of the Lord, there is no question of their destruction. Only our conditioned vision of their manifestation was destroyed. This is the meaning of the word näçaù."
