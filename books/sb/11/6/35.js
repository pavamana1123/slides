When the Lord had completed His earthly pastimes He wanted to send these demigods back to their previous service in universal administration. Each demigod was to return to his respective planet. The transcendental city of Dvärakä is so auspicious that whoever dies there immediately goes back home, back to Godhead, but because the demigod members of the Yadu dynasty, in many cases, were not yet prepared to go back to Godhead, they had to die outside the city of Dvärakä. Thus Lord Kåñëa, pretending to be an ordinary living being, said, \"We are all in danger. Let us all immediately go to Prabhäsa.\" In this way, by His yoga-mäyä Kåñëa bewildered such demigod members of the Yadu dynasty and led them away to the holy place Prabhäsa."

Actually, Lord Kåñëa's pastime of removing the Yadu dynasty is ultimately auspicious, but since it outwardly appeared inauspicious, it could not take place in Dvärakä; therefore Lord Kåñëa led the Yadus away from Dvärakä. After having sent the demigods back to their planets, Lord Kåñëa planned to return to the spiritual world, Vaikuëöha, in His original form and remain in the eternal city of Dvärakä."

Prabhäsa is a famous holy place located near the Veraval railway station, within the region of Junagarah. In Chapter Thirty of the Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is written that after hearing the words of Çré Kåñëa, the Yädavas went to the mainland from the island city of Dvärakä by means of boats and then traveled to Prabhäsa in chariots. At Prabhäsa-kñetra they drank a beverage called maireya and became engaged in a mutual quarrel. A great battle ensued, and killing each other with hard stalks of cane, the members of the Yadu dynasty acted out the pastime of their own annihilation."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in order to bewilder the demons and ensure that the word of His own devotees and of the brähmaëas be maintained, created a body of material energy into which the arrow was shot. But the Lord's actual four-armed form was never touched by the arrow of Jarä, who is actually the Lord's devotee Bhågu Åñi. In a previous age Bhågu Muni had placed his foot on the chest of Lord Viñëu. In order to counteract the offense of improperly placing his foot on the Lord's chest, Bhågu had to take birth as a degraded hunter. But even though a great devotee willingly accepts such a low birth, the Personality of Godhead cannot tolerate seeing His devotee in such a fallen condition. Thus the Personality of Godhead arranged that at the end of Dväpara-yuga, when the Lord was winding up His manifest pastimes, His devotee Bhågu, in the form of the hunter Jarä, would cast the arrow into a material body created by the Lord's illusory energy. Thus the hunter would become remorseful, gain release from his degraded birth and go back to Vaikuëöha-loka."

The Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, from His very appearance on the earth, did not manifest any of the material qualities of ordinary human beings. The Lord did not appear from the womb of His mother. Rather, by His inconceivable power He descended into the maternity room. At the time of His giving up this mortal world, He similarly manifested an illusory situation for the sake of bewildering the demons. To bewilder the nondevotees, the Lord created an illusory body out of His material energy while simultaneously remaining personally in His own sac-cid-änanda body, and thus He manifested the downfall of an illusory, material form. This pretense effectively bewilders foolish demons, but Lord Çré Kåñëa's actual transcendental, eternal body of bliss never experiences death."

The place at which the two rivers Sarasvaté and Hiraëyä flow together into the ocean is named Bhågu-tértha, and there the hunter cast his arrow. There is an elaborate description of Prabhäsa-tértha in the Prabhäsa-khaëòa of the Skanda Puräëa. There are also many phala-çrutis given within the Mahäbhärata in connection with Prabhäsa-tértha. Phala-çrutis are scriptural statements that promise various auspicious results for one who performs a particular pious activity. In the following verses the Lord Himself will explain the particular benefits to be derived from visiting Prabhäsakñetra and performing religious activities there."
