    "translation": "My dear Lord, the original puruña-avatära, Mahä-Viñëu, acquires His creative potency from You. Thus with infallible energy He impregnates material nature, producing the mahat-tattva. Then the mahat-tattva, the amalgamated material energy, endowed with the potency of the Lord, produces from itself the primeval golden egg of the universe, which is covered by various layers of material elements.",

In this verse it is clearly stated that Lord Kåñëa is the source of the greatest Viñëu incarnation, Mahä-Viñëu, and that Mahä-Viñëu acquires His creative potency from Lord Kåñëa. It would therefore be foolish to surmise that Lord Kåñëa is an expansion of Viñëu. In this regard the opinion of the demigods, headed by Brahmä, can be taken as final."
