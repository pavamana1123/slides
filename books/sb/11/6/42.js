My Lord, it appears that You will now withdraw Your dynasty, and thus You Yourself will finally give up Your pastimes within this universe. You are the supreme controller and the master of all mystic power. But although You are fully capable of counteracting the brähmaëas' curse against Your dynasty, You are not doing so, and Your disappearance is imminent.",

However, in the eyes of ordinary, unenlightened persons the withdrawal of the Yadu dynasty appears to be its destruction. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has very nicely explained the statement of Uddhava as follows."

The Lord rid the world of demons and firmly established both His devotees and religious principles. Lord Kåñëa is addressed here as yogeça because He not only performed work on behalf of the demigods, but also revealed His beautiful, transcendental form, full of transcendental qualities and ecstasies, for the pleasure of His pure devotees. Kåñëa is called puëya-çravaëa-kértana because when by His internal mystic potency He exhibited His humanlike activities, the Lord stimulated the writing of innumerable Vedic scriptures about His pastimes. Thus persons who would be born in the future, like ourselves would be able to hear and chant about the Lord's activities and also go back home, back to Godhead."

Uddhava could understand the Lord's desire and said to Kåñëa, \"You have instructed the Yädavas to counteract the brähmaëas' curse by taking bath at Prabhäsakñetra, but how could mere bathing in a holy place be of greater value than seeing You, the Personality of Godhead, face to face? Since the Yädavas are always seeing Your transcendental form, and since You are the Supreme Lord, what is the use of their taking bath in a so-called holy place? Therefore You obviously have some other purpose. If You actually wanted to counteract the curse, You could simply say, 'Let this curse not act,' and the curse would immediately be neutralized. Therefore You must be preparing to leave this universe, and that is why You have not counteracted the curse.\""
