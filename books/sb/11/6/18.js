            "content": "In the previous verse it was clearly stated that no material object can attract the senses of the Lord. Now in this verse it is demonstrated that the Lord has no desire to enjoy even spiritual sense gratification. Kåñëa is complete in Himself. He is the reservoir of all pleasure, and He does not lust after anything material or spiritual. The argument may by given that Kåñëa, in order to please His wife Satyabhämä, stole a pärijäta flower from heaven and thus appeared to be a henpecked husband under the control of His loving wife. But although Kåñëa is sometimes conquered by the love of His devotees, He is never influenced by the desire to enjoy like an ordinary, lusty materialistic person. The nondevotees cannot understand the overwhelming loving feelings exchanged between the Lord and His pure devotees. Kåñëa may be conquered by our intense love for Him, and thus pure devotees can control the Lord. For example, the elderly gopés in Våndävana would clap their hands in different rhythms to make Kåñëa dance, and in Dvärakä Satyabhämä ordered Kåñëa to bring her a flower as proof of His love for her. As stated in Çréniväsa Äcärya's song to the six Gosvämés, gopé-bhäva-rasämåtäbdhi-laharé-kallola-magnau muhuù: the love between the Lord and His pure devotee is an ocean of spiritual bliss. But at the same time, Kåñëa remains completely self-satisfied. Kåñëa indifferently gave up the company of the incomparable young damsels of Vraja-bhümi, the gopés, and went to Mathurä at the request of His uncle, Akrüra. Thus neither the gopés of Våndävana nor the queens of Dvärakä could arouse an enjoying spirit in Kåñëa. When all is said and done, pleasure in this world means sex. But this mundane sexual attraction is simply a perverted reflection of the transcendental loving affairs between Kåñëa and His eternal associates in the spiritual world. The gopés of Våndävana are unsophisticated village girls, whereas the queens in Dvärakä are aristocratic young ladies. But both the gopés and the queens are overwhelmed with love for Kåñëa. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa displays the highest perfection of beauty, strength, wealth, fame, knowledge and renunciation and is thus completely satisfied by His own supreme position. He reciprocates spiritual loving affairs with the gopés and queens simply for their sake. Only fools think that Lord Kåñëa could be attracted by the perverted illusory pleasures to which we poor conditioned souls are so blindly attached. Therefore everyone should recognize the supreme transcendental position of the Personality of Godhead and surrender to Him. That is the clear implication of this statement by the demigods."
