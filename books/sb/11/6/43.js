He had no desire to merge into Kåñëa's impersonal effulgence; instead he wanted to go to the Lord's spiritual abode and continue associating with Kåñëa as His dearmost friend. Kåñëa is the Personality of Godhead and can do whatever He likes, but the devotee begs the Lord for the chance to serve Him. Although the Lord manifests within the material world His various abodes, such as Våndävana, Dvärakä and Mathurä, and although these are certainly nondifferent from their counterparts in the spiritual world, the most advanced devotees, overwhelmed with desire to personally serve the Lord, are very eager to go to the Lord's original spiritual planet. As stated by Lord Kapila in the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the pure devotees have no desire for liberation. Because of their eagerness to render service, they urge the Lord to appear before them. The six Gosvämés, due to their intense eagerness to serve Rädhä and Kåñëa, urgently searched after Them, calling out Their names in the forests of Våndävana. Similarly, Uddhava is urging the Lord to take him to His own abode so that Uddhava's personal service to the Lord's lotus feet will not be interrupted even for a moment."

            "content": "Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that immature conditioned souls think that Lord Kåñëa is an ordinary jéva soul engaged in material activities and was thus unable to protect His own dynasty from the curse of the brähmaëas. Uddhava's statement corrects such unfortunate persons. It is Lord Kåñëa Himself who awarded pious living entities birth in brahminical families, and then Lord Kåñëa further awarded them the potency to curse His dynasty. And finally, Lord Kåñëa personally kept the curse intact, although He was capable of neutralizing it. Therefore in the beginning, middle and end, directly and indirectly, in the past, present and future, Lord Kåñëa is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is completely transcendental to even the slightest touch of material illusion or impotence."
