    "translation": "My dear King, Uddhava was a constantly faithful follower of Lord Kåñëa. Upon seeing the imminent departure of the Yädavas, hearing from them of the Lord's instructions and taking note of the fearful omens, he approached the Personality of Godhead in a private place. He bowed down with his head at the lotus feet of the supreme controller of the universe and with folded hands addressed Him as follows.",

The great disasters apparently occurring in Dvärakä were an external show created by the Lord to facilitate His pastimes. We can understand the pastimes of Kåñëa only by hearing from the recognized äcäryas. Lord Kåñëa is not a mundane historical figure, and His activities cannot be confined within the tiny limits of material logic. Lord Kåñëa's pastimes are an exhibition of His acintya-çakti, or inconceivable potency, which functions according to higher, spiritual laws, unknown to the blind conditioned souls and their petty material logic."
