If the spiritual master is bona fide and if the disciple is sincere and obedient, then the communication between guru and disciple is just like nectar, both for the guru and the disciple. Ordinary persons cannot even imagine the special pleasure experienced by the devotees of the Lord. Such nectarean speaking and hearing destroys all contamination within the heart of a conditioned soul, the primary contamination being the desire to live without serving Kåñëa."

Lord Vämanadeva bathed His own lotus foot by kicking a hole in the universal covering so that the sacred Ganges water washed His toes and fell into the universe. The Yamunä River also washed Kåñëa's lotus feet when the Lord appeared on this planet five thousand years ago. Kåñëa sported daily with His boyfriends and girl friends in the Yamunä River, and consequently that river is also caraëämåta. One should therefore try to take bath in the Ganges or Yamunä."

Çréla Prabhupäda taught his disciples and followers to come before the Deities each morning and drink three drops of the caraëämåta from the Deities' bathing."

            "content": "In all these ways one can purify his heart and relish spiritual bliss. When one is fixed on the platform of spiritual bliss, then one does not take another birth in the material world. In this verse the word çuci-ñadaù is significant: one must engage in the purified activities of Kåñëa consciousness. One must learn to serve the Lord from the bona fide spiritual master, whose instructions one should accept without speculation. Those who are attached to the phantasmagoria of this world sometimes concoct their own whimsical concepts of God. But only from the bona fide spiritual master can we get perfect and pure knowledge about the Supreme Personality of Godhead and devotional service to Him. Such knowledge may be found in all the books of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda."
