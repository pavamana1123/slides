Thus one should take to the regulated practice of yoga, which in this age means the process of chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the avadhüta brähmaëa is recommending bhakti-miçra añöäìga-yoga, or the eightfold mystic yoga process performed as an offering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

            "content": "The desire to enjoy the material world is so strong that the mind wanders here and there uncontrollably. Therefore it is stated, dhriyamäëam: the mind must be fixed in the goal of life, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the perfect stage of mental concentration called samädhi there is no longer any distinction between internal and external vision, since one can see the Absolute Truth everywhere."

            "content": "In the mystic yoga process one must sit properly, and then it is possible to control the different airs within the body. When the breathing process is controlled, the mind, which is dependent upon the actions of the bodily airs, is easily fixed in higher consciousness. But although the mind may be momentarily controlled, if one is overcome by desire for sense gratification the mind will again be lost. Thus, this verse emphasizes vairägya, detachment from material illusion. This is attained by abhyäsa-yoga, the regulated practice of Kåñëa consciousness, which is the highest yoga system, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä :"
