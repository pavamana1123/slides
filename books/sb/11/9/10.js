    "translation": "When many people live together in one place there will undoubtedly be quarreling. And even if only two people live together there will be frivolous conversation and disagreement. Therefore, to avoid conflict, one should live alone, as we learn from the example of the bracelet of the young girl.",

Because the young girl mentioned in this story had no husband, she had to fulfill her duties as a host by removing her bracelets so that each wrist held one bracelet only. In the same way, the process of jïäna-yoga, or spiritual advancement by philosophical speculation, demands that the speculating sages live alone, without any other association. Since jïänés have dedicated their lives to speculation. there will undoubtedly be endless argument and quarreling on technical points if many jïänés live together. Therefore, to keep a peaceful atmosphere they must live alone. On the other hand, a king's daughter who has been duly married to an aristocratic prince fulfills her duties to her husband by dressing herself attractively with innumerable ornaments and approaching him for love. Similarly, the goddess of devotion, Bhakti-devé, decorates herself with the innumerable ornaments of the Vaiñëavas, who come together to relish the sweet sound of the holy name of the Lord. Because pure Vaiñëavas do not intimately associate with nondevotees, it may be said that they reside alone, and thus they also fulfill the purpose of this verse. There cannot be any quarrel among pure Vaiñëavas, because they are on the real platform of desirelessness, not wanting even salvation or mystic powers, what to speak of sense gratification. Because they are all devotees of Kåñëa, they may freely associate with one another for glorifying the Lord. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

Similarly, one should give up the association of those who are not devoted to the Supreme Lord.\" This is the actual lesson to be learned. A real Vaiñëava is always pure and faultless in character. However, in those places where nondevotees congregate there will undoubtedly be envious criticism of the devotional service of the Lord, and those who falsely attempt to analyze reality without the Supreme Personality of Godhead will create much disturbing noise in the name of philosophy. Therefore, one should remain in those places where the Supreme Lord is properly worshiped according to the Vedic standard. If everyone is dedicated to glorifying the Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, there will not be any impediment in mutual association. However, in a place where people have many different purposes besides the pleasure of the Supreme Lord, social dealings will certainly be disrupted."

One who always keeps himself in the company of the devotees of the Lord is actually living alone. If one lives in a community where the only consideration is the pleasure of the Lord, then one can avoid the contradictory situations caused by many persons competing to satisfy their own material desires. This is the lesson intelligently understood by the brähmaëa from the bracelets of the young girl."
