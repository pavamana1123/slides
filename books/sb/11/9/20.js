    "translation": "According to great sages, that which is the basis of the three modes of material nature and which manifests the variegated universe is called the sütra or mahat-tattva.

The conditioned soul foolishly tries to become the lord of this inferior creation and becomes separated from his real friend, the Supreme Lord. In this state, his only business is material sense gratification, and his real knowledge is lost."
