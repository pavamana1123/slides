    "translation": "Lord Kåñëa replied: Because all material elements are present everywhere, it is reasonable that different learned brähmaëas have analyzed them in different ways. All such philosophers spoke under the shelter of My mystic potency, and thus they could say anything without contradicting the truth.",

            "content": "The words santi sarvatra in this verse indicate that all material elements are found within each other in gross and subtle forms. In this way there are innumerable ways to categorically describe them. The material world is ultimately illusory, undergoing constant transformation. It may be measured in different ways, just as the mirage of an oasis may be described in different ways, but the Lord's own analysis of twenty-eight elements is perfect and should be accepted. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé states that the word mäyä in this verse does not refer to mahä-mäyä, or the potency of ignorance, but to the Lord's inconceivable mystic power, which shelters the learned followers of Vedic knowledge. Each of the philosophers mentioned here reveals a particular aspect of truth, and their theories are not contradictory, since they are simply describing the same phenomena with different categorical systems. Such philosophical disagreement is endless within the material world; thus everyone should unite on the platform of the Lord's own opinion, as stated in this verse. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa requests all conditioned souls to give up their various forms of worship and surrender unto Him in full Kåñëa consciousness, becoming His devotees. Thus the whole universe can be united in love of Godhead by chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. By the Lord's revealing Himself to a sincere devotee, the controversy of analytic philosophy is ended."
