Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura replies that by the mystic power of jäti-smara one can remember one's previous body, and as is well known, \"The exception establishes the rule.\" Normally, conditioned souls do not perceive their past existence; they think, \"I am six years old\" or \"I am thirty years old,\" and \"previous to this birth I did not exist.\" In such material ignorance one cannot understand the actual situation of the soul."
