    "translation": "When the three modes of nature are agitated, the resultant transformation appears as the element false ego in three phases—goodness, passion and ignorance. Generated from the mahat-tattva, which is itself produced from the unmanifest pradhäna, this false ego becomes the cause of all material illusion and duality.",

            "content": "By giving up one's false ego of identification with the three modes of nature, one can achieve Kåñëa consciousness, the pure, original state of existence. The word moha-vikalpa-hetuù indicates that because of false ego one considers himself to be the enjoyer of nature and thus develops a false sense of material duality in terms of material happiness and distress. False ego is removed by identifying oneself as the Lord's eternal servitor in full Kåñëa consciousness."
