Actually, Lord Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead, is the proprietor and enjoyer of our activities; recognition of this fact in Kåñëa consciousness leads one to real renunciation. Every human being should perform his prescribed duty as an offering to the Supreme Lord. Then there will be no possibility of material entanglement. Lord Kåñëa clearly explains in Bhagavad-gétä that prescribed duties performed as an offering to the Lord award liberation from material bondage. Sinful activities cannot be offered to the Lord but must be given up altogether. In effect, the distinction between piety and sin is made so that the living entities will become pious and eligible to surrender to the Supreme Lord. As explained in Bhagavad-gétä ,"
