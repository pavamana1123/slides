    "synonyms": "utpattyä eva—simply by birth; hi—indeed; kämeñu—in objects of selfish desires; präëeñu—in vital functions (such as one's duration of life, sense activities, physical strength and sexual potency); sva-janeñu—in his family members; ca—and; äsakta-manasaù—having become attached within the mind; martyäù—mortal human beings; ätmanaù—of their real self; anartha—of defeating the purpose; hetuñu—which are the causes.",
    "translation": "Simply by material birth, human beings become attached within their minds to personal sense gratification, long duration of life, sense activities, bodily strength, sexual potency and friends and family. Their minds are thus absorbed in that which defeats their actual self-interest.",

            "content": "Our attachment to the material body and the bodies of family and friends inevitably leads to unbearable anxiety and suffering. The mind absorbed in the bodily concept of life cannot possibly advance in self-realization, and thus one's hope for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge is defeated by the objects of one's so-called affection. Activities performed in ignorance are beneficial neither for oneself nor others, just as the charitable activities one may perform in a dream bestow no tangible benefit on real people. The conditioned soul is dreaming of a world separate from God, but any advancement experienced in this dream world is merely hallucination. The Lord states in Bhagavad-gétä, sarva-loka-maheçvaram:  He is the supreme enjoyer and Lord of all planets and worlds. Only by Kåñëa consciousness, recognition of the supremacy of God, can one make actual progress in life."
