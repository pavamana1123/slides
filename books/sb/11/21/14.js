By one's individual potency one should avoid sinful activities and the association of those inclined toward sense gratification. The word karma here refers to prescribed duties, such as worshiping the spiritual master and the Deity, chanting the Gäyatré mantra three times daily and accepting spiritual initiation. The prescribed duties of the varëäçrama system automatically purify one from the covering of false ego by dovetailing one's bodily designation in appropriate religious activities. There are specific duties for brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas, çüdras, brahmacärés, gåhasthas, vänaprasthas and sannyäsés, as described previously in this canto by the Lord Himself. The most significant word here is mat-småtyä (\"by remembrance of Me\"). Ultimately, one cannot avoid the infection of illusion through any process except Kåñëa consciousness. The three modes of nature perpetually interact, and one must sometimes fall into the mode of ignorance and sometimes rise to the mode of goodness, uselessly rotating within the kingdom of illusion. But by Kåñëa consciousness, remembrance of the Personality of Godhead, one can actually uproot one's tendency to act against the will of the Absolute Truth. Then one becomes freed from the clutches of mäyä and goes back home, back to Godhead. As stated in the Garuòa Puräëa,"
