Although foolish people think they are helping themselves and others, they actually do not know their own identity, nor the identities of their so-called friends and relatives. Absorbed in gratifying the senses of the external body, they spend their lives uselessly, without spiritual profit. This useless life-style can be transformed into a perfect life simply by chanting the holy names of God in Kåñëa consciousness, as recommended by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu."
