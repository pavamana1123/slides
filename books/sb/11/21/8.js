            "content": "The word kåñëa-sära refers to the spotted antelope, whose hide is used by brahmacärés while residing in the äçrama of the spiritual master. Brahmacärés never hunt in the forest, but rather accept skins from those animals already deceased. The skin of the black or spotted antelope is also used as a garment by those receiving instruction in the execution of Vedic sacrifice. Therefore, since sacrifice cannot be properly performed in areas bereft of such creatures, these places are impure. Furthermore, although the inhabitants of a particular place may be expert in performing fruitive activities and ritualistic sacrifices, if they are inimical to the devotional service of the Lord, such a place is also polluted. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains that previously the provinces of Bihar and Bengal were bereft of devotional service to the Lord and were considered impure. Then great Vaiñëavas such as Jayadeva appeared in these territories, converting them into holy places."

            "content": "The word asauvéra indicates those places without suvéras, respectable saintly persons. Ordinarily, a person who obeys the state laws is considered a respectable citizen. In the same way, one who strictly obeys the law of God is considered to be a cultured or decent man, suvéra. The place where such intelligent persons reside is called sauvéram. Kékaöa refers to the modern state of Bihar, which traditionally has been known as a territory of uncivilized men. Even in such provinces, however, any place where saintly persons gather is considered to be holy. On the other hand, a province of generally respectable persons is immediately polluted by the presence of sinful men. Asaàskåta indicates lack of external cleanliness, as well as the absence of purificatory ceremonies for internal cleanliness. Çréla Madhväcärya quotes from the Skanda Puräëa as follows: \"Religious persons should reside within an eight-mile radius of rivers, oceans, mountains, hermitages, forests, spiritual cities or places where the çälagräma-çélä is found. All other places should be considered kékaöa, or contaminated. But if even in such contaminated places black and spotted antelopes are found, one may reside there as long as sinful persons are not also present. Even if sinful persons are present, if the civil power rests with respectable authorities, one may remain. Similarly, one may dwell wherever the Deity of Viñëu is duly installed and worshiped.\""
