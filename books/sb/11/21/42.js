    "translation": "In the entire world no one but Me actually understands the confidential purpose of Vedic knowledge. Thus people do not know what the Vedas are actually prescribing in the ritualistic injunctions of karma-käëòa, or what object is actually being indicated in the formulas of worship found in the upäsanä-käëòa, or that which is elaborately discussed through various hypotheses in the jïäna-käëòa section of the Vedas.",

Since the Lord is the source, maintainer and ultimate goal of Vedic knowledge, He is veda-vit, or the only true knower of Vedic knowledge. So-called philosophers, either Vedic scholars or ordinary men, may give their sectarian opinion, but it is the Lord Himself who knows the confidential purpose of the Vedas. The Lord is the only actual shelter and lovable object for all living entities. As He states in the Tenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä :"

Although ordinary people may quarrel over the purpose of religion, the actual purpose is one, Kåñëa consciousness, or pure love of Godhead. All Vedic formulas are understood to be preliminary stages leading to the perfect stage of Kåñëa consciousness, in which one fully surrenders to the devotional service of the Lord. The pure devotees of the Lord represent Him within this world and never speak anything which is not authorized by the Lord. Because they are repeating the Lord's own words, they are also to be understood as true knowers of the Veda."
