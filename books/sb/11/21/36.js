This is because three of the divisions are internally situated within the living entity and only the fourth division is externally manifested, as speech. Even this fourth phase of Vedic sound, called vaikharé, is very difficult to understand for ordinary human beings. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains these divisions as follows. The präëa phase of Vedic sound, known as parä, is situated in the ädhära-cakra; the mental phase, known as paçyanté, is situated in the area of the navel, on the maëipüraka-cakra; the intellectual phase, known as madhyamä, is situated in the heart area, in the anähata-cakra. Finally, the manifest sensory phase of Vedic sound is called vaikharé."

            "content": "Such Vedic sound is ananta-pära because it comprehends all vital energies within the universe and beyond and is thus undivided by time or space. Actually, Vedic sound vibration is so subtle, unfathomable and deep that only the Lord Himself and His empowered followers such as Vyäsa and Närada can understand its actual form and meaning. Ordinary human beings cannot comprehend all of the intricacies and subtleties of Vedic sound, but if one takes to Kåñëa consciousness one can immediately understand the conclusion of all Vedic knowledge, namely Lord Kåñëa Himself, the original source of Vedic knowledge. Foolish persons devote their vital air, senses and mind to sense gratification and thus do not understand the transcendental value of the holy name of God. Ultimately, the essence of all Vedic sound is the holy name of the Supreme Lord, which is not different from the Lord Himself. Since the Lord is unlimited, His holy name is equally unlimited. No one can understand the transcendental glories of the Lord without the Lord's direct mercy. By offenselessly chanting the holy names Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, one can enter into the transcendental mysteries of Vedic sound. Otherwise the knowledge of the Vedas will remain durvigähyam, or impossible to penetrate."
