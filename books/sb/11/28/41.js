Therefore this process cannot be accepted as devotional service to the Lord, according to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura. Despite all such mystic perfections, the material body will ultimately die. Actual eternal youth and happiness are available only on the spiritual platform of Kåñëa consciousness."
