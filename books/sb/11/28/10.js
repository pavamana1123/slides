    "translation": "Çré Uddhava said: My dear Lord, it is not possible for this material existence to be the experience of either the soul, who is the seer, or of the body, which is the seen object. On the one hand, the spirit soul is innately endowed with perfect knowledge, and on the other hand, the material body is not a conscious, living entity. To whom, then, does this experience of material existence pertain?",

The conscious experience of material life cannot be denied, and thus Uddhava asks Lord Kåñëa this question to elicit a more precise understanding of the process by which illusion occurs."
