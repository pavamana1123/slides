In this regard Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura emphasizes that although haöha-yogés and räja-yogés try to make progress along their prescribed paths, they confront obstacles and often fail to achieve their desired goals. However, one who surrenders to the Supreme Lord will certainly be victorious on his spiritual path back home, back to Godhead."
