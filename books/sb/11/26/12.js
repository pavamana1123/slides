One who hankers after a woman's association certainly spoils his spiritual progress. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura states that if one worships the example of the liberated gopés of Våndävana, who accepted Lord Çré Kåñëa as their paramour, one can free one's mental activities from the contamination of lust."
