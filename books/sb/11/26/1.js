Within the material world the association of women is especially dangerous, and therefore in this chapter the Aila-géta is spoken to prevent such a falldown. One can be saved from sex attraction by association with saintly persons, who awaken one's real spiritual intelligence. Therefore Lord Kåñëa will speak to Uddhava the amazing song of Purüravä, also known as the Aila-gétä."
