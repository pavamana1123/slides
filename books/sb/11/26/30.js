In the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Lord Kåñëa told the gopés that they would have to accept their own service as the ultimate reward of their devotion to Him, since nothing awards as much happiness and knowledge as devotional service itself. When one sincerely chants and hears the holy name and fame of Lord Kåñëa, the heart is purified ad gradually one can appreciate the actual, blissful nature of Kåñëa consciousness, loving service to the Lord."
