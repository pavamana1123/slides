Similarly, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has stated, bhakti-pratiküla-deha-gehädiñv äsaktim. Because of one's attachment to one's temporary body and so-called home, family, friends and so on, one's intelligence is always disturbed by fear, and one is unable to appreciate or practice pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. So-called religious activities executed in the bodily conception of life are always accompanied by fear and anxiety about the ultimate result. But pure devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead frees one from fear and anxiety because it is executed on the platform of Vaikuëöha, or the spiritual plane, where there is no fear or anxiety. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the process of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that even in the stage of sädhana-bhakti, in which one is practicing devotional service through rules and regulations, the neophyte can have a direct experience of fearlessness by the mercy of the Lord. As one's devotional service becomes mature, the Lord reveals Himself to the devotee, and all fear is totally vanquished forever."

The result of such false attachment is continuing distress, which can be eradicated only by devotional service to the Supreme Lord."
