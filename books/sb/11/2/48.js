It should be understood that unless one comes in contact with the lotus feet of a pure devotee of the Lord, the path of freedom from material illusion is very difficult to understand. In the fifth verse of Çré Upadeçämåta Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has stated, çuçrüñayä bhajana-vijïam ananyam anya-nindädi-çünya-hådam épsita-saìga-labdhyä: \"One should associate with and faithfully serve that pure devotee who is advanced in undeviated devotional service and whose heart is completely devoid of the propensity to criticize others.\" Çréla Prabhupäda comments, \"In this verse Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé advises the devotee to be intelligent enough to distinguish between the kaniñöha-adhikäré, madhyama-adhikäré and uttama-adhikäré. A neophyte Vaiñëava or a Vaiñëava situated on the intermediate platform can also accept disciples, but such disciples must be on the same platform, and it should be understood that they cannot advance very well toward the ultimate goal of life under his insufficient guidance. Therefore a disciple should be careful to accept an uttama-adhikäré as a spiritual master.\" Therefore additional symptoms will now be given so that the conditioned soul who desires to go back home, back to Godhead, can properly identify the bona fide spiritual master."

Similarly, in the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä Arjuna asked Kåñëa about the symptoms of a completely Kåñëa conscious person, and Kåñëa elaborately explained the symptoms of one who is prajïä pratiñöhitä, or established in Kåñëa consciousness."

The concept of giving up one's personal identity is a reaction to the terrible frustration of material egotism. It is not a positive program. If one is suffering unbearable pain in his hand, he may agree to have the hand amputated, but the real solution is to remove the infection so that the healthy hand may become a source of pleasure. Similarly ego, or the sense that \"I am,\" is a source of unlimited happiness when we understand what we are, namely servants of Kåñëa. Impersonal meditation is dry and troublesome. A pure devotee realizes that he is an eternal person, part and parcel of the Supreme Person, Lord Kåñëa, and that he has the privilege as the son of God to participate in the ecstatic eternal pastimes of the Supreme Lord, loving Kåñëa and playing with Him forever. For such a devotee the pale material nature, which is but a perverted reflection of the spiritual world, becomes totally unattractive. Therefore, one who is completely attached to Kåñëa and uninterested in the manifestations of mäyä can be considered bhägavatottamaù, a pure devotee of the Lord, as described in a previous verse (bhaktiù pareçänubhavo viraktir anyatra ca )."

Mäyä is like a shadow of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who serves Him in the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this world. Just as a shadow has no independent power of movement but follows the substance that casts the shadow, the illusory energy of the Lord has no independent power, but bewilders the living entities according to the Lord's desire. One of Kåñëa's opulences is that He is supremely detached; when a living entity wants to forget Him, Kåñëa immediately employs His illusory energy to facilitate the foolishness of the conditioned soul."

Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has stated that if one gives up those material things which are favorable for serving Kåñëa, considering them material and therefore an impediment to his spiritual advancement, his renunciation is merely phalgu-vairägya, or immature and imperfect renunciation.

Therefore those who are trying to advance in Kåñëa consciousness should not endanger their transcendental experience by unnecessarily criticizing other Vaiñëavas. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, if one engages in phalgu-vairägya, or renouncing material things that are favorable to the service of Lord Kåñëa, one runs the risk of being polluted by impersonal philosophy. On the other hand, by sticking to the principle of yukta-vairägya, engaging everything for Kåñëa without personal desire, one can remain aloof from the danger of material sense gratification and gradually come to the mahä-bhägavata platform, as mentioned in this verse."
