Bhukti-kämé refers to those ordinary persons who desire money and everything money can buy. Such a primitive mentality is based on the desire to enjoy money, sex and social prestige. When a living being becomes frustrated with this hallucination, he takes to the path of speculative philosophy and analytically tries to track down the source of illusion. Such a person is called mukti-kämé because he desires to negate material illusion and merge into an impersonal spiritual state, free from anxiety. The mukti-kämé is also motivated by personal desire, although the desire is somewhat more elevated. Similarly the siddhi-kämé, or the mystic yogé who desires the spectacular powers of mystic yoga, such as reaching one's hand across the world or making oneself smaller than the smallest or lighter than the lightest, is also infected by material or selfish desire. Therefore it is said, sakali 'açänta.' If one has any personal desire, whether it be material, philosophical or mystic, he will be açänta, or ultimately frustrated, because he will see himself as the central object of satisfaction. This egocentric concept is in itself illusory and therefore ultimately frustrating."

Elevation to the heavenly kingdom, condemnation to hell and liberation from material bondage all appear the same to a devotee.\"  Although the impersonalist philosopher proposes that everything is one, the devotee of the Lord is actually tulyärtha-darçé, or empowered with the vision of oneness. The devotee sees everything as the potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and therefore desires to engage everything in the service of the Lord, for the Lord's satisfaction. Since the devotee does not see anything as dvitéya, or outside the scope of the Lord's potency, he is happy in any situation. Having no personal desire, the devotee of Kåñëa is actually çänta, or peaceful, because he has achieved the perfection of life, love of Kåñëa. He is actually situated in his eternal constitutional position under the direct shelter and protection of the omnipotent Parameçvara, Kåñëa."
