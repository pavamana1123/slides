            "content": "In the Second Chapter of this canto, bhägavata-dharma, or pure devotional service to Kåñëa, is explained by Närada Muni to Vasudeva, who had inquired with devotion. Närada Muni cites a conversation between King Nimi and the Jäyanteyas. According to Jéva Gosvämé, the word abhékñëam indicates that although Närada Muni was frequently sent by Lord Kåñëa here and there for various pastimes, such as inquiring about the affairs of the world, Närada continuously returned to reside in Dvärakä. The word kåñëopäsana-lälasaù indicates that Närada was very eager to be near Kåñëa and worship Him. Because of the curse of Dakña, Närada is never allowed to live continuously in one place. Çrédhara Svämé, however, has pointed out, na tasyäà çäpädeù prabhävaù: in Dvärakä there is no influence of curses or other such evils, because Dvärakä is the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is always protected by His arms, as shown by the word govinda-bhuja-guptäyäm. The conditioned souls are struggling within the kingdom of mäyä against the cruel laws of material nature, such as birth, death, old age and disease, but if such conditioned souls have the good fortune to enter the city of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whether Dvärakä, Mathurä or Våndävana, and live there under the direct protection of the omnipotent arms of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, they will experience the unlimited transcendental bliss of real life, which is eternal and which is meant to be lived in the personal company of God."
