    "translation": "A devotee should not see anything as being separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Ether, fire, air, water, earth, the sun and other luminaries, all living beings, the directions, trees and other plants, the rivers and oceans—whatever a devotee experiences he should consider to be an expansion of Kåñëa. Thus seeing everything that exists within creation as the body of the Supreme Lord, Hari, the devotee should offer his sincere respects to the entire expansion of the Lord's body.",

Similarly a very lusty man notices women everywhere.\" In the same way, a pure devotee should see the transcendental form of the Lord within everything, since everything is an expansion of the Lord. It is our practical experience that a greedy man will see money everywhere. If he goes to the forest he will immediately consider whether it would be profitable to purchase the forest land and sell the trees to a paper mill. Similarly, if a lusty man goes to the same forest he will look everywhere for beautiful women tourists who might happen to be there. And if a devotee goes to the same forest he will see Kåñëa there, knowing correctly that the entire forest, as well as the sky canopy above, is the inferior energy of the Lord. Kåñëa is supremely sacred, being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and since everything that exists expands directly or indirectly from the body of the Lord, everything is sacred when seen through the eyes of a self-realized person. Therefore as stated in this verse, praëamet: one should offer one's sincere respects to everything. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has mentioned that we should see the personal form of Kåñëa everywhere."

Whatever we see as disconnected from Kåñëa will have in our mind no relationship to Kåñëa's service. But if we see everything as connected to Kåñëa, we shall use everything for Kåñëa's satisfaction. This is called yukta-vairägya. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, \"One who has experienced his own true identity understands that all things exist as paraphernalia for giving ecstatic pleasure to the Supreme Lord. Thus one becomes free from the separatist vision in which one sees the world as existing for one's own enjoyment. In the transcendental state, whatever a devotee sees reminds him of Kåñëa, and thus his transcendental knowledge and bliss increase.\" Because the impersonalist philosophers fail to see everything as belonging to the personal form of Kåñëa, they reject this world as having no true existence (jagan mithyä). But since the material world is an emanation from the supreme reality, Kåñëa, it does in fact exist. Its nonexistence is simply a creation of the imagination, and one cannot possibly act on such an imaginary platform. Therefore, having proposed an illusory theory and being unable actually to live on such a platform, the impersonalist comes back to the material platform for altruistic or gross sense gratificatory activities. Since the impersonalist does not accept the personal proprietorship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he does not know how or for whom to engage the things of this world, and since it is impossible to reject this world totally while living within it, he runs the risk of again becoming entangled in material fruitive activities. Therefore as stated in Bhagavad-gétä , kleço 'dhikataras teñäm: the impersonal path of imaginary philosophy is very painful to follow."
