    "translation": "Fear arises when a living entity misidentifies himself as the material body because of absorption in the external, illusory energy of the Lord. When the living entity thus turns away from the Supreme Lord, he also forgets his own constitutional position as a servant of the Lord. This bewildering, fearful condition is effected by the potency for illusion, called mäyä. Therefore, an intelligent person should engage unflinchingly in the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord, under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, whom he should accept as his worshipable deity and as his very life and soul.",

The living entity falsely identifies with his material body, family, society and so on, and he simply has to give up this false identification. Then what will mäyä be able to do?"

But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.\" The living entity, called jéva-tattva, is one of the potencies of the Supreme Lord, but the constitutional position of the living entity is taöa-stha, or marginal. Being minute, every living entity is eternally dependent upon the supreme living entity, Kåñëa. This is confirmed in the Vedic literature as follows: nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäà/ eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän. \"Among all the eternally conscious beings there is one supreme eternal living being who is supplying the needs of all the innumerable others.\" (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.1.12) Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja has stated, ekale éçvara kåñëa, ära saba bhåtya: \"Kåñëa is the only independent controller; all other living entities depend upon Him.\" ) have the eternal duty (sanätana-dharma) of engaging in the unalloyed service of the Lord."

Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura comments that when the living entity develops a spirit of independence he is forced to come to the material world, where he enters into various types of petty and undesirable behavior that create a fearful situation for him. The bahiraìgä-çakti, the illusory potency of the Supreme Lord, covers all trace of the cit-çakti and imposes one material body after another upon the living entity for his gross sinful enjoyment. As further punishment, the living entity who has given up his loving relationship with Kåñëa loses all power to perceive the eternal, blissful form of the Supreme Lord, who is his actual shelter. Instead the living entity becomes attached to many temporary, phantasmagorical forms, such as his personal body, the bodies of his family members and friends, his nation, his city, with its buildings and cars, and innumerable types of ephemeral material scenery. In such a state of gross ignorance the idea of returning to one's original identity no longer even crosses the mind."

This conflict is described in many places in the Bhägavatam as guëa-vyatikaram. When the living entity is bewildered by the interactions of the modes of material nature, he comes to the conclusion of relativity and assumes that God and worship of God are simply by-products of the relative, contradictory interactions of nature's modes. In the name of anthropological, sociological or psychological perspective, the living entity falls deeper and deeper into the darkness of materialistic ignorance, dedicating himself to mundane piety, economic development, sense gratification, or speculation in which he regards the Absolute as lacking variety and personality, which he assumes to be products of the interactions of nature's modes."

Now we are suffering because we are falsely seeking pleasure on the material platform and as a result we are becoming entangled in the painful complexities of material existence. But if we try to give up the pleasure-seeking propensity altogether, we shall eventually become frustrated and return to the platform of material pleasure-seeking. Although there is eternal existence on the Brahman platform of impersonal realization, there is no änanda. Variety is the mother of enjoyment. In the Vaikuëöha planets there is actual, spiritual änanda. Kåñëa is there in His ecstatic, spiritual form, surrounded by His blissful associates, all of them eternally full of bliss and knowledge. They have nothing to do with material existence. In the spiritual planets even the scenery and birds and animals are fully conscious of Kåñëa and are absorbed in transcendental bliss. Yad gatvä na nivartante tad dhäma paramaà mama . One who goes to the blissful, spiritual planet of Kåñëa will be fully satisfied and never come back to the material platform. Therefore Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has said, kià cätra bhaktaiù saàsära-bandhän na bhetavyam. Only the bhakta actually becomes free from fear."

The bona fide spiritual master is completely free from envy of other living entities, and therefore he freely distributes knowledge of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the living entities who are inimical to the service of the Lord somehow hear this knowledge submissively, they become free from the illusory potency of the Lord, which has covered them and thrown them into various miserable species of life. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, by the mercy of the spiritual master the faithful disciple gradually realizes the transcendental position of Lord Näräyaëa, who is served with great awe and reverence by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. As the disciple's transcendental knowledge gradually increases, even the paramaiçvarya, or supreme opulence, of the Lord of Vaikuëöha becomes pale in the light of the beauty of Govinda, Kåñëa. Govinda has inconceivable potency to enchant and give pleasure, and by the mercy of the spiritual master the disciple gradually develops his own blissful relationship (rasa) with Govinda. Having understood the blissful pastimes of Lakñmé-Näräyaëa, Çré Sétä-Räma, Rukmiëé-Dvärakädhéça and finally Lord Kåñëa Himself, the purified living entity is given the unique privilege of participating directly in the devotional service of Kåñëa, who becomes his only object and shelter."
