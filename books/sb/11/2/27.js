The Supreme Soul, Lord Kåñëa, is the original source of all light. His brilliantly glowing body is the source of the all-pervading brahmajyoti, the immeasurable spiritual light that is the resting place of innumerable universes (yasya prabhä prabhavato jagad-aëòa-koöi (BS 5.40)). The individual soul, being part and parcel of the Lord, is also self-effulgent. In fact, everything in the kingdom of God is self-effulgent, as described in Bhagavad-gétä :"

            "content": "It has already been described in many ways that the nava-yogendras were pure devotees of the Lord. Being completely Kåñëa conscious souls, they naturally radiated the intense effulgence of the soul, as indicated here by the word sva-rucä. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has also pointed out that the word brahma-putropamän, meaning \"equal to the sons of Brahmä,\" indicates that the nava-yogendras were on the same spiritual platform as the four exalted Kumära brothers. It has been described in the Fourth Canto that Mahäräja Påthu received the four Kumäras with great love and reverence, and here King Nimi is similarly receiving the nine sons of Lord Åñabhadeva. Receiving exalted Vaiñëavas with love and reverence is standard spiritual etiquette for those who desire progress and happiness in life."
