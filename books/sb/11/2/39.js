    "translation": "An intelligent person who has controlled his mind and conquered fear should give up all attachment to material objects such as wife, family and nation and should wander freely without embarrassment, hearing and chanting the holy names of the Lord, the bearer of the chariot wheel. The holy names of Kåñëa are all-auspicious because they describe His transcendental birth and activities, which He performs within this world for the salvation of the conditioned souls. Thus the holy names of the Lord are sung throughout the world.",

Therefore the word loke indicates that one should chant the holy names of the Lord that are well known on this particular planet. Within this world, Lord Räma and Lord Kåñëa are very famous. Their books, Rämäyaëa and Bhagavad-gétä, are studied and relished all over the world. Similarly, Caitanya Mahäprabhu is gradually becoming famous all over the world, as He Himself predicted. Påthivéte äche yata nagarädi gräma/ sarvatra pracära haibe mora näma: \"In every town and village on this earth the glories of My name will be chanted.\" Therefore in conformity with the authorized statement of this verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the Kåñëa consciousness movement emphasizes the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—along with the Païca-tattva mahä-mantra—çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu-nityänanda çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda."

Similarly, Lord Kåñëa has described the process of bhakti-yoga as susukhaà kartum, very joyfully performed, and Çréla Locana däsa Öhäkura has sung, saba avatära sära çiromaëi kevala änanda-käëòa. Caitanya Mahäprabhu's process for worshiping Kåñëa is kevala änanda-käëòa, simply joyful. In this connection Çréla Prabhupäda has stated that people in any part of the world can assemble, chant the Hare Kåñëa mantra, read from authorized books such as Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, and accept kåñëa-prasädam sumptuously, just as Caitanya Mahäprabhu did in Navadvépa."

If one indulges in material sense gratification, surely he will be in the bodily concept of life. One who is in the bodily concept of life will undoubtedly have a materialistic understanding of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, by considering the Lord's pastimes mundane, one will come within the category of Mäyäväda, or impersonalism, in which one considers the transcendental body of the Lord to be a creation of material nature. Therefore the word asaìgaù in this verse is very significant. One must chant the holy name of the Lord without mental speculation. One must accept Lord Kåñëa as He presents Himself in Bhagavad-gétä, wherein He states that He alone is Puruñottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that His transcendental form is eternal (ajo 'pi sann avyayätmä)."

And the sat-paramparä can be identified by reference to bona fide Vedic scriptures. Contrary to the opinion of uninformed critics, the followers of Kåñëa consciousness are not mindless or fanatical. They intelligently follow the system of checks and balances called guru, sädhu and çästra. That is, one must accept a bona fide spiritual master, who must in turn be confirmed by the opinion of great saintly persons and revealed scriptures. If one accepts a bona fide spiritual master, follows the example of great saintly persons and becomes conversant with authorized literature such as Bhagavad-gétä As It Is and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, one's program of chanting the holy names of the Lord and hearing about the Lord's pastimes will be completely successful. As Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä :"

Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has stated, asat-saìga-tyäga-ei vaiñëava äcära : a Vaiñëava is known by his complete avoidance of all mundane association. If in the course of traveling and chanting the glories of the Lord a Vaiñëava preacher finds a submissive nondevotee who is willing to hear about Kåñëa, the preacher will always give his merciful association to such a person. But a Vaiñëava should strictly avoid those who are not interested in hearing about Kåñëa."

Frustrated living entities sometimes take to dry impersonalism and avoid the descriptions of the Supreme Lord's eternal name, form, qualities, entourage and pastimes. But if one gains the association of a pure devotee, one gives up the path of dry speculative argument and becomes situated on the actual Vedic path of devotional service to the Lord."

The Mäyäväda conception of advaita, which lacks any spiritual distinctions, is simply another manifestation of the mind's function of acceptance and rejection. The eternal appearance and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead never contradict the concept of advaya-jïäna, or transcendental knowledge beyond duality."
