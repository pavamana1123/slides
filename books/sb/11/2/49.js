    "translation": "Within the material world, one's material body is always subject to birth and decay. Similarly, the life air [präëa] is harassed by hunger and thirst, the mind is always anxious, the intelligence hankers for that which cannot be obtained, and all of the senses are ultimately exhausted by constant struggle in the material nature. A person who is not bewildered by the inevitable miseries of material existence, and who remains aloof from them simply by remembering the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is to be considered bhägavata-pradhäna, the foremost devotee of the Lord.",

Ordinary human beings generally have good and bad qualities, and according to this mixture they enjoy and suffer on the earth.

As stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä , susukhaà kartum avyayam. Even in the stage of regulative practice, the process of bhakti-yoga is very joyful. Similarly, Locana däsa Öhäkura, a near contemporary of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, said, saba avatära sära çiromaëi kevala änanda-käëòa. Although there are various käëòas, or divisions, of Vedic discipline, such as karma-käëòa (fruitive ceremonies) and jïäna-käëòa (regulated speculation), Caitanya Mahäprabhu's hari-näma saìkértana movement is kevala änanda-käëòa, the pathway of pure bliss. Simply by chanting the holy names of Kåñëa, eating the remnants of sumptuous food offered to the Supreme Lord and hearing the enchanting pastimes of the Personality of Godhead, one merges into an ocean of bliss called Kåñëa consciousness."

One should not identify himself as a gross material body, nor as a fickle mind, nor as speculative intelligence, nor should one foolishly identify himself with the so-called void of Buddhist imagination. Nor should one even identify himself with the ocean of impersonal spiritual life called the brahmajyoti, which illuminates the great outdoors of the spiritual sky beyond the covered universe. One should rather identify himself correctly as an eternal individual servant of the supreme individual Personality of Godhead. By this simple admission of one's constitutional position and by sincere engagement in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, one is quickly promoted to direct participation in the eternal pastimes of Kåñëa, just as Arjuna got the opportunity to play with Kåñëa as a soldier on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra."

When a conditioned soul of demoniac mentality identifies himself with the gross material body, he undergoes miseries of constant drowsiness and unquenchable sexual desires that burn all mental peace and serenity to ashes. When a demoniac person identifies himself with präëa, the life air, he suffers from hunger, and by identifying himself with the mind he suffers panic, fear, and hankering that ends in disappointment. When he identifies himself with intelligence, he suffers profound existential bitterness and frustration deep within his heart. When he identifies himself with the false ego, he feels inferiority, thinking, \"I am so low.\" And when he identifies himself with the process of consciousness, he is haunted by memories of the past. When a demon tries to impose himself as the ruler of all living beings, all of these miseries expand simultaneously."

In this connection Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has quoted from the Åg Veda (1.156.3) as follows: oà äsya jänanto näma cid vivaktan mahas te viñëo su-matià bhajämahe oà tat sat. \"O Viñëu, Your name is completely transcendental. Thus it is self-manifest. Indeed, even without properly understanding the glories of chanting Your holy name, if we vibrate Your name with at least a small understanding of its glories—that is, if we simply repeat the syllables of Your holy name—gradually we shall understand it.\" The supreme entity indicated by the praëava oà is sat, or self-revealing. Therefore, even if one is disturbed by fear or envy, the transcendental form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will become manifest to one who continues to chant the Lord's holy name. Further evidence is given in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"
