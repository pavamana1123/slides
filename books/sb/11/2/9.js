In the previous verse Vasudeva stated that because he had been bewildered by the illusory energy of the Lord he could not achieve from the Supreme Personality of Godhead the boon of liberation. Therefore he is now approaching the pure devotee of the Lord, confident that by the mercy of the Lord's devotee he will certainly achieve liberation from material bondage."

            "content": "In this connection the words aïjasä, \"easily,\" and addhä, \"directly,\" are very important. Although foolish persons proudly want to jump up directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead without accepting His pure devotee as spiritual master, those who are experienced in spiritual science know that by submission and service at the lotus feet of a pure devotee one directly contacts the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  Lord Kåñëa has stated, äcäryaà mäà vijänéyän nävamanyeta karhicit. Thus one should understand that the pure devotee of Kåñëa stands on the same spiritual level as the Lord Himself. This does not mean that a pure devotee is also God, but because of his intimate loving connection with the Lord, he is accepted by the Lord as being the Lord's very soul. In other words, Kåñëa is always in the heart of His pure devotee, and the pure devotee is always in the heart of Kåñëa. Although Çré Kåñëa is eternally the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one without a second, the Lord is more pleased to see His pure devotee worshiped. Therefore the Lord says, äcäryaà mäà vijänéyät. One must offer the same respect to the Vaiñëava spiritual master as one would offer to the Lord. Therefore as soon as one pleases the Vaiñëava spiritual master, one immediately pleases Kåñëa and makes spiritual advancement. The word aïjasä means that this bona fide process is the easiest method of achieving spiritual perfection. And because the pure devotee is a transparent medium, the word addhä, \"directly,\" is used, indicating that service rendered to the pure devotee goes directly to the lotus feet of Kåñëa, whereas service one whimsically offers to Kåñëa directly, bypassing the bona fide spiritual master, is not actually accepted and is therefore useless."

            "content": "Those who actually desire the highest perfection, that of going back home, back to the eternal, blissful kingdom of Kåñëa, should study very carefully the example shown by Çré Vasudeva in these two verses. He indicates that although one cannot achieve liberation by directly worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can very easily achieve the perfection of life simply by a moment's association with a pure devotee of Lord Kåñëa such as Närada Muni, the exalted Vaiñëava saint among the demigods."

As one can become perfect by worshiping the Vaiñëavas, by displeasing the Vaiñëavas one can bring about all misfortune. Thus Vasudeva feared the curse delivered by the brähmaëas at Piëòäraka-tértha."
