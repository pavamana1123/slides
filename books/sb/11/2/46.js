Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has confirmed that a Vaiñëava should be indifferent to those who are envious of the Supreme Lord. It is practically seen that when such persons are informed of the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they attempt to ridicule the Supreme Lord, thus further deteriorating their polluted existence.

Furthermore, the intermediate devotee should not in any way associate with the powerful atheistic class of men, because there is danger that his mind will become bewildered by such association. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, if a Vaiñëava preacher encounters one who is envious of him, the preacher should remain far away from such an envious person. But the Vaiñëava preacher may meditate upon ways to save the envious class of men. Such meditation is called sad-äcära, or saintly behavior. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has mentioned Prahläda Mahäräja as an example of a saintly person. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  there is the following statement by Prahläda:"

He states that upekñä, or neglect, as mentioned in this verse, is the proper medicine for those who are inimical to the Supreme Lord and His devotees. Indifference from the preacher checks feelings of hostility on both sides. Although there is a Vedic injunction that one should cut out the tongue of a person who offends the Supreme Lord and His devotees, in this age it is best simply to avoid potential offenders and thus prevent them from committing further sinful activities against the Vaiñëavas. It is the duty of a Vaiñëava preacher to point out the futility of any process besides surrendering to the Supreme Lord. An envious person, however, will resent such strong preaching by a Vaiñëava and disrespect him, considering the devotee to be unnecessarily criticizing others. Such a person, who cannot appreciate the mercy of Vaiñëavas, should be neglected. Otherwise, according to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, his cheating mentality will increase day by day."

Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta has stated, \"When childish people think themselves mahä-bhägavatas and act in defiance of the Vaiñëava spiritual master, such behavior simply holds them back from receiving the mercy of the Vaiñëava guru. Bewildered by false ego, these self-proclaimed devotees gradually become fit to be ignored by pure devotees on the intermediate platform and are cheated of the mercy that comes from the devotees' satisfaction. Thus they become asädhu by constantly committing offenses against the devotees who preach the holy name of Kåñëa. Pure devotees, therefore, in all circumstances display indifference to those who falsely imagine themselves to be viçuddha-bhaktas, or pure devotees of the Lord. This indifference is an excellent manifestation of their mercy.\" In other words, those who criticize the Vaiñëava preachers on the second-class platform for discriminating between those who are fit to receive the Lord's mercy and those who are simply envious are misunderstanding the mission of the Lord.

Rather, when a first-class devotee or even a second-class devotee rejects the atheistic class of men, he is expressing the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A first-class or second-class Vaiñëava never actually becomes envious of another living entity, but out of intense love for the Supreme Lord he becomes angry when the Lord is offended. Also, understanding the Lord's mission, he discriminates according to the position of a particular living entity. To consider such a Vaiñëava preacher an ordinary, envious person, or to consider him sectarian because of his proclamation of pure devotional service as the most exalted of all methods of spiritual advancement, reflects a materialistic vision called vaiñëave jäti-buddhiù or guruñu nara-matiù.

A pure devotee sees every living entity as part and parcel of Kåñëa and therefore expresses his love for Kåñëa through love for all the expansions and creations of Kåñëa. Still, such a mahä-bhägavata feels special ecstatic love upon seeing another living entity directly pleasing the senses of the Supreme Lord.

            "content": "On the other hand, if it is the Lord's desire, a pure devotee can offer his respects to all living beings. For example, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé mentions that Uddhava and other pure devotees of the Lord were always prepared to offer respectful obeisances even to such persons as Duryodhana. Madhyama-adhikärés, however, should not imitate such uttama-adhikäré behavior. In this connection, the distinction between madhyama-adhikäré and uttama-adhikäré is stated by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura as follows: atra sarva-bhüteñu bhagavad-darçana-yogyatä yasya kadäcid api na dåñöä. A madhyama-adhikäré cannot at any time perceive the presence of the Supreme Lord within all living beings, whereas an uttama-adhikäré, however he acts on the second-class platform to carry out the Lord's mission, is aware that every living entity is ultimately a forgetful Kåñëa conscious living entity. Therefore, although a devotee may externally engage four different types of behavior, as mentioned in this verse—namely, worship of the Lord, friendship with the devotees, preaching to the innocent and rejection of the demons—he is not necessarily on the second-class platform, since an uttama-adhikäré also may exhibit these symptoms to carry out the Lord's mission. In this regard, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura mentions that it is the duty of the madhyama-adhikäré to extend himself as the right hand of the uttama-adhikäré, vowing to work for the benefit of others and offering to help in distributing love of Kåñëa."

Arcana refers to the platform of sädhana-bhakti, in which one serves the Lord to carry out the rules and regulations of the process. One who has achieved the shelter of the Lord's holy name and is totally engaged in the attempt to serve the Lord should be considered to be on the platform of bhajana, even though his external activities may sometimes be less strict than those of the neophyte engaged in arcana. This apparent lack of strictness, however, refers to laxity not in the basic principles of sane behavior and renunciation of sense gratification, but rather in the details of Vaiñëava ceremonies."
