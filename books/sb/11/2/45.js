For example, when the stalwart demon Hiraëyakaçipu questioned his self-realized son Prahläda Mahäräja as to the whereabouts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Prahläda, being a mahä-bhägavata, or pure devotee, answered straightforwardly that the Supreme Lord is everywhere. The demoniac father then asked if God was in the pillar of the palace. When Prahläda answered yes, Hiraëyakaçipu, being a bona fide demon, struck the pillar with his sword, trying to kill God, or at least disprove His existence. Then Lord Nåsiàhadeva, the most ferocious form of the Supreme Lord, immediately appeared and finished forever the illicit program of Hiraëyakaçipu. Thus Prahläda Mahäräja can be accepted as an uttama-adhikäré devotee."

But by continuing to serve the Supreme Lord and the devotees engaged in propagating the Lord's mission, the kaniñöha-adhikäré also advances in his realization and comes to the stage of dedicating his activities to helping more advanced Vaiñëavas. Even such kaniñöha-adhikärés can help ordinary living entities by their association, since at least the kaniñöha-adhikärés have faith that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of this faith, the kaniñöha-adhikäré gradually becomes inimical to those who are opposed to the Lord. As he gradually becomes more and more inimical to those who hate the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and becomes more attracted to friendship with other faithful servants of the Lord, the kaniñöha-adhikäré approaches the second-class stage, called madhyama. In the madhyama stage the Vaiñëava sees the Lord as the cause of all causes and the chief goal of everyone's loving propensity. He sees the Vaiñëavas as his only friends within this morbid world and is eager to bring innocent people within the shelter of Vaiñëava society. Also, a madhyama-adhikäré strictly avoids associating with the self-proclaimed enemies of God. When such an intermediate qualification becomes mature, the concept of supreme qualification begins to present itself; that is, one comes to the stage of uttama-adhikäré."

As a living entity develops mundane piety, he proudly devotes himself to regulated work and nobly tries to detach himself from the fruits of his work. Through such regulated detached work, knowledge or wisdom gradually arises. As knowledge or wisdom becomes prominent, the pious materialist becomes attracted to altruistic and charitable work and gives up gross sinful activities. If he is fortunate, he then becomes favorable to the transcendental devotional service of the Lord. Desiring a mere intellectual understanding of devotional service, such a pious materialist may seek shelter at the feet of a kaniñöha-adhikäré. If able to advance to the madhyama qualification, he then becomes attracted to a Vaiñëava actively engaged in preaching Kåñëa consciousness. And when fully mature on the platform of intermediate devotion, he becomes attracted to the mahä-bhägavata level and is awarded a glimpse of the exalted position of the mahä-bhägavata spiritual master by the grace of Kåñëa within his heart. If one gradually goes on in the devotional service of the Lord, one becomes established as a paramahaàsa mahä-bhägavata. At this stage all of his actions. movements and engagements in preaching are dedicated solely to the satisfaction of Kåñëa. The illusory potency, mäyä, has no power to throw or cover such a purified living entity. In Upadeçämåta (5) Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has described this stage of life as bhajana-vijïam ananyam anya-nindädi-çünya-hådam."

Such devotional power springs automatically from the ocean of mercy found within the heart of a pure devotee. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points out that a mahä-bhägavata has no desire to inflict punishment on the enemies of the Lord. Rather, he engages the madhyama-adhikärés and kaniñöha-adhikärés in preaching work to purify the polluted mentality of the inimical souls, who are falsely imagining the material world to be separate from Kåñëa."

Such unfortunate souls, attracted to impersonal Mäyäväda speculation, follow faithfully in the footsteps of Kaàsa, Agha, Baka and Pütanä and are thus killed by Çré Hari. In this way the community of sense gratifiers remains uninterested in service at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, and according to the individual perverted vision of so-called self-interest, each materialist chooses his own misfortune in the form of repeated birth and death in various types of material bodies. There are 8,400,000 species of material forms, and the materialistic living entities select the particular flavors of birth, old age, disease and death they wish to inflict upon themselves under the hallucinations of so-called material progress."

In a similar way, a pure devotee of Kåñëa sees Kåñëa consciousness everywhere, although it may be temporarily covered. Thus one sees the world just as one sees himself (ätmavan manyate jagat). On this basis one may argue that the vision of the mahä-bhagavata is also illusioned, since the Bhägavatam has already stated throughout that those conditioned by the three modes of material nature are not at all Kåñëa conscious but in fact are inimical to Kåñëa. But although the conditioned living entity may appear inimical to the Lord, the eternal, unalterable fact is that every living being is part and parcel of Kåñëa. Although one's ecstatic love for Kåñëa may now be covered by the influence of mäyä, by the causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the conditioned soul will gradually be promoted to the stage of Kåñëa consciousness."

This is mäyä, or \"that which is not.\" Actually, to think that misery arises from anything other than separation from Kåñëa is to be in illusion. So when a pure devotee sees living entities suffering within this world, he correctly feels that just as he is suffering because of separation from Kåñëa, all other living beings are also suffering from separation from Kåñëa. The difference is that a pure devotee correctly ascertains the cause of his heartbreak whereas the conditioned soul, bewildered by mäyä, is unable to understand his eternal relationship with Kåñëa and the unlimited pain arising from neglect of that relationship."

Of course, Närada, Vyäsa and Çukadeva are considered to be on the highest standard of pure devotional service, and therefore the real qualification is tad-didåkñädhikya, or having an overwhelming desire to see the Lord. Therefore the statement of Bhagavad-gétä that a devotee should see Kåñëa everywhere (yo mäà paçyati sarvatra) can be understood in terms of the example of a lusty man's thinking that the world is full of beautiful women. Similarly, one should become transcendentally so desirous of seeing the Lord that one can perceive within the entire universe nothing but Kåñëa and His potency. Väsudevaù sarvam iti . In Çréla Prabhupäda's correspondence in 1969 with Professor J. F. Staal of the University of California, Çréla Prabhupäda claimed that all of his disciples who were strictly following the intense program of Kåñëa consciousness were in fact sudurlabha-mahätmäs who were seeing väsudevaù sarvam. In other words, if one is constantly engaged in Kåñëa consciousness with an intense desire to please the Lord and one day gain His association, it is to be understood that in one's life there is nothing but Kåñëa. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has warned us, however, that a mere theoretical or academic understanding that Kåñëa is everything does not qualify one as a first-class devotee. One must actually have developed love for Kåñëa. Therefore it can be practically understood that anyone who enthusiastically adopts the Kåñëa consciousness program and eagerly participates in the preaching activities of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is acting on the platform of a madhyama-adhikäré devotee. When such a devotee becomes overwhelmed by his desire to serve Kåñëa and associate with the Lord, so much so that he is not attracted to anything else within the universe, he should be understood to be an uttama-adhikäré Vaiñëava, as mentioned in this verse."
