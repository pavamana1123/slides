Indeed, the pure devotees of Lord Viñëu wander throughout the universe not for their personal, selfish interest, but to purify all the conditioned souls.",

It is well known that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental to the three modes of material nature, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä : mäm ebhyaù param avyayam. Similarly, His pure devotees are also on the transcendental platform. One may ask how such transcendental living beings as the associates of Lord Viñëu could be seen within the material world. Therefore it is stated here, pävanäya caranti hi: the associates of Lord Viñëu travel throughout the universe to reclaim the fallen, conditioned souls on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A representative of the governor may be seen moving within the prison house, but that does not mean that the governor's representative has become a conditioned prisoner. It is understood that he is within the prison to negotiate the possible release of those prisoners who have rectified their criminal propensity. Similarly, the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead called parivräjakäcäryas wander throughout the universe inviting everyone to surrender to Lord Kåñëa and go back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge."

Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that the associates of Lord Viñëu are as merciful as the Lord Himself. Even though the ignorant members of human society are not interested in approaching the servants of Lord Viñëu, the devotees of the Lord, without any false prestige, act to liberate the conditioned souls from their perpetual misfortune."
