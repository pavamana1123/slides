Although apparently still a conditioned soul, one who offers the fruits of all his activities to the Lord can no longer be touched by the countless miseries that arise from the reactions to materialistic activities."

Yet self-realized souls continue to perform all types of work within this world to carry out the mission of the Supreme Lord. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, those karmés who are sufficiently pious follow the example of the self-realized souls by trying to offer the fruits of their own duties at the lotus feet of the Lord. Although this is counted as karma-miçrä bhakti, or devotional service mixed with the desire to execute fruitive activities, such mixed devotional service is gradually transformed into pure devotional service. As the pious fruitive workers disengage themselves, step by step, from the bogus philosophy of \"enjoyment of one's hard-earned rewards,\" pure devotional service rewards them with complete good fortune."

Those with a primitive, materialistic concept of the Supreme Lord consider the Lord present only in a temple or church. They make some offering to the Lord in the place of worship, but in their normal activities they claim proprietorship, not thinking that God is present everywhere and within everyone. We have practical experience of many so-called religious men who become very offended if their children try to become servants of the Supreme Lord. They feel, \"God should be pleased with whatever humble offering I give Him, but my family and ordinary business affairs belong to me and are under my control.\" The perception of anything as separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His proprietorship is called mäyä, or illusion. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has quoted, na kevalaà vidhitaù kåtam eveti niyamaù; svabhävänusäri laukikam api: \"The regulation that one should serve the Supreme Lord does not refer only to prescribed religious paths, ceremonies and regulations; rather, all the activities one performs in this world according to one's personal nature should be dedicated to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\""

In Bhagavad-gétä  the Supreme Lord has personally taken credit for establishing the system of varëäçrama-dharma: cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù. Therefore if one offers his work within the varëäçrama-dharma system to the Supreme Lord, such work is counted as devotional service. According to one's svabhäva, or nature, one may work as an intellectual or priest, as an administrator or military man, as an agriculturist or mercantile man, or as a laborer or craftsman. And while working, everyone should meditate on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking, yat sakalaà parasmai näräyaëäya: \"I am working for the Supreme Lord. Whatever result comes from my work, I shall accept the bare minimum for my personal maintenance, and the rest I shall offer for the glorification of Lord Näräyaëa.\""

The four pillars of sinful life are illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. Such activities are never acceptable as offerings to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example may be given that although in a free society each person is allowed to choose his own occupation, even a democratic government will not allow a citizen to choose the occupation of thief or murderer. In the same way, according to the laws of God one is invited to work according to his own nature in the varëäçrama system, but one is forbidden to adopt a criminal life of sinful activities violating the laws of God."

He says that an ordinary sense gratifier begins his activities in the morning by passing stool and urine, cleaning his mouth, brushing his teeth, bathing, meeting his friends and family members and discussing with them the day's business. In this way one has so many activities during the day, and a sense gratifier executes all these activities for his personal material enjoyment. A karmé, on the other hand, working under the jurisdiction of the karma-käëòa section of the Vedas, will perform the same activities for the pleasure of the demigods and his forefathers. Thus, according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, a devotee of the Supreme Lord, Näräyaëa, should similarly perform all of his daily activities for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. In this way everything we do throughout the day will become bhakty-aìga, or a supplementary aspect of our devotional service to Kåñëa."

But the äcäryas have emphasized in their commentaries on this verse that such a false ego, by which one identifies oneself as a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya, çüdra, sannyäsé, gåhastha and so on, should also be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

The example may be given that although any good citizen will pay his taxes to the government, he may not necessarily love the government or its leaders. Similarly a pious living entity can understand that he is working under the laws of God, and therefore in accordance with Vedic injunctions or the injunctions of other scriptures he offers a portion of his assets to the Supreme Lord in religious ceremonies. But when such a pious person actually becomes attached to chanting and hearing about the personal qualities of the Lord and when love thus becomes visible, he is considered to be reaching the mature stage of life. In this regard, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has quoted several verses that very nicely show the development of love for Godhead. Anena durväsanä-duùkha-darçanena sa karuëä-mayaù karuëäà karotu: \"May the merciful Lord show mercy on me by demonstrating the misery created by sinful desires.\" Yä prétir avivekänäà visayeñv anapäyiné/ tväm anusmarataù sä me hådayän näpasarpatu: \"Unintelligent persons have unflinching affection for the objects of sense gratification. Similarly, may I always remember You, so that that same attachment, applied to You, never leaves my heart.\" (Viñëu Puräëa 1.20.19) Yuvaténäà yathä yüni yünäà ca yuvatau yathä/ mano 'bhiramate tadvan mano me ramatäà tvayi: \"As the minds of young girls take pleasure in thinking of a young boy and those of young boys take pleasure in thinking of a young girl, may my mind take pleasure in You.\" Mama sukarmaëi duñkarmaëi ca yad räga-sämänyam, tad sarvato-bhävena bhagavad-viñayam eva bhavatu: \"Whatever attraction I have for pious or sinful activities, let that attraction be wholeheartedly invested in You.\""
