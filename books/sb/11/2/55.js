    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is so kind to the conditioned souls that if they call upon Him by speaking His holy name, even unintentionally or unwillingly, the Lord is inclined to destroy innumerable sinful reactions in their hearts. Therefore, when a devotee who has taken shelter of the Lord's lotus feet chants the holy name of Kåñëa with genuine love, the Supreme Personality of Godhead can never give up the heart of such a devotee. One who has thus captured the Supreme Lord within his heart is to be known as bhägavata-pradhäna, the most exalted devotee of the Lord.",

A pure devotee is one who has attracted the Lord by his love so that the Lord cannot give up the devotee's heart. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the word säkñät in this verse indicates that a pure devotee has realized knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, having given his heart to the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, who is all-attractive in six opulences, including beauty. A pure devotee can never be attracted by the fleshy bags of women's breasts or by the hallucinations of so-called society, friendship and love within the material world. Therefore his clean heart becomes a suitable abode for the Supreme Lord. A gentleman will live only in a clean place. He will not live in a polluted, contaminated place. Educated people in the Western countries are now greatly protesting the pollution of water and air by urban industrial enterprises. People are demanding the right to live in a clean place. Similarly, Lord Kåñëa is the supreme gentleman, and therefore He will not live in a polluted heart, nor will He appear within the polluted mind of a conditioned soul. When a devotee surrenders to Lord Kåñëa and becomes a lover of the Lord by direct realization of Kåñëa's all-attractive nature, the Lord makes His residence in the clean heart and mind of such a pure devotee."

If a devotee is absorbed in the loving transcendental service of Kåñëa, directly or indirectly he is always glorifying the Lord by transcendental loving service. Therefore, even if he chants the holy name of Kåñëa with improper attention due to being absorbed in the Lord's service, the mercy of the Lord purifies his heart of all sinful reactions. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

In the Sixth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, in the purports to the history of Ajämila, Çréla Prabhupäda has elaborately explained the holy name's potency to purify even an ordinary person."

Mother Yaçodä bound the child Kåñëa to a grinding mortar with a rope. Kåñëa, being attracted by the inconceivable love of His devotees, allowed Himself to be bound. Therefore, although Lord Kåñëa binds all the conditioned souls by the chains of His illusory potency, mäyä, if those same conditioned souls become pure devotees of the Lord they can in turn bind Kåñëa by the chains of love of God."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead never leaves the hearts of those who give up all sinful behavior and chant His holy name. Even if such chanting is not yet perfect, devotee who always remains in the Lord's service will gradually come to the stage of prema-niñöhä, or steady love of Godhead. Then they are to be considered mahä-bhägavatas, or pure devotees of the Lord."
