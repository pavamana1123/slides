    "translation": "Birth in an aristocratic family and the execution of austere and pious activities certainly cause one to take pride in himself. Similarly, if one enjoys a prestigious position within society because his parents are highly respected members of the varëäçrama social system, one becomes even more infatuated with himself. But if despite these excellent material qualifications one does not feel even a tinge of pride within himself, he is to be considered the dearmost servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

Marriages in which the mother comes from a higher class than the father are called pratiloma. In any case, one who becomes proud of his so-called prestigious birth is certainly in the bodily concept of life. Birth in any material body is a serious problem, which one should solve by surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can thereby release himself from the golden shackles of a so-called aristocratic material body."

There is no other way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One must be situated in the institution of the four varëas and äçramas.\" (Viñëu Puräëa 3.8.9) Thus they think that material work in which a portion of the fruits are offered to God forms the highest platform of human life. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, there are several småti literatures that have encouraged such mixed devotional service. Such books are taken by materialistic devotees as facility for offending the holy name of the Lord because of egotistic attachment to the material body. Thus one thinks that a prestigious position in the varëäçrama system according to birth and so-called pious activities is a prerequisite for becoming successful in life."

As long as one's mentality is encumbered by the material designations of the varëäçrama system, one has very little chance of becoming free from material bondage and establishing himself as dear to the Lord. In this regard, Caitanya Mahäprabhu emphatically declared that He could not identify Himself with any varëäçrama designation, such as that of a great intellectual or priest, a courageous warrior in the Lord's army, a brilliant businessman making money for the Lord, or the hardest worker for the Lord. Nor could Caitanya Mahäprabhu identify Himself as a stalwart brahmacäré, a noble householder or an exalted sannyäsé. These designations reflect the material pride that can infiltrate the execution of devotional service. Although a devotee may carry out the standard duties of varëäçrama, his only designation is gopé-bhartuù pada-kamalayor däsa-däsänudäsaù , the eternal servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord, the master of the gopés, Kåñëa."

The Supreme Lord can be pleased only by unalloyed devotion, and not by any arrangement of the gross body, composed of five material elements, or the subtle body, composed of innumerable speculations and bogus pride. In other words, Lord Kåñëa can never be pleased by one's so-called aristocratic body, which is due to be devoured by worms or vultures. If one becomes proud of his material birth and so-called pious activities, by such false pride one gradually develops the impersonal mentality of merely renouncing the fruit of work or else the karmé mentality of enjoying the fruits of work. Neither the karmés nor the jïäné speculators are aware that the fruit of work actually belongs to Kåñëa. The conclusion is that one should carefully give up all false pride and always remember that he is a humble servant of Kåñëa. As stated by Caitanya Mahäprabhu, amäninä mänadena kértanéyaù sadä hariù ."
