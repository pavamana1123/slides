Furthermore, being puffed up by his own ceremonial worship (ätmano bhakti-darpataù), a kaniñöha-adhikäré cannot imagine that anyone is more pious or religious than he, and he is not even aware that other devotees are more advanced. Thus he cannot understand the madhyama or uttama standard of devotional service, and sometimes, because of his false pride, he criticizes the more advanced devotees of the Lord, neglects them or simply has no understanding of their exalted position as preachers or completely self-realized souls."

Having a bodily concept of life himself, he is attracted by material opulence and thus minimizes the position of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu. Such a kaniñöha-adhikäré, therefore, is disturbed if a second-class devotee criticizes the nondevotees of the Lord. In the name of compassion or kindness, a kaniñöha-adhikäré approves of the nondevotional activities of such materialistic men. Because the kaniñöha-adhikäré is ignorant of the higher realms of devotional service and the unlimited transcendental bliss of Kåñëa consciousness, he sees devotional service merely as the religious aspect of life but thinks that life has many enjoyable and worthwhile nondevotional aspects. Therefore he becomes angry when second-class devotees, who are experiencing that Kåñëa is everything, criticize the nondevotees. Madhväcärya says that such a person, because of his rudimentary faith in Kåñëa, is considered a devotee, but he is bhaktädhama, a devotee on the lowest standard. If such materialistic devotees follow the rules and regulations of Deity worship, they will gradually be elevated to a higher standard and eventually become pure devotees of the Lord, unless they commit offenses against other devotees, in which case their advancement will be checked."

If someone is envious of the demigods, he is to be considered envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, one who offers sincere respect to the demigods is considered to be respecting the will of the Supreme Lord. A Vaiñëava does not foolishly think that there are many gods. He knows that there is one Supreme Personality of Godhead. But as stated many times in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the Lord has a mission within this material world, which is to reform the conditioned living entities through the cruel laws of nature. In the Lord's mission within this world, the demigods are to be considered limbs of the Lord's body. It is stated in Bhagavad-gétä :"

Even today the preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement cultivate important people with all kindness and diplomacy so that such wealthy or influential people will engage their resources in the devotional service of Kåñëa to glorify Kåñëa all over the world. Similarly, offering all respects to the demigods so that they will give facility for the devotional service of Kåñëa is not against the bhakti-märga, although nowadays such demigod worship has also deteriorated. Therefore, Caitanya Mahäprabhu has recommended hari-näma saìkértana, chanting the holy names of Kåñëa, as the only realistic process for this age. Nonetheless, a devotee of the Lord should not misinterpret Bhagavad-gétä's injunctions against demigod worship as a license to offend the demigods, who are bona fide Vaiñëavas."

Çréla Jéva Gosvämé says, iyaà ca çraddhä na çästrärthävadhäraëa-jätä. Because the kaniñöha-adhikäré's faith is not actually based on the statements of Vedic literature, he cannot understand the exalted position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within everyone's heart. Therefore he cannot actually manifest love of Godhead, nor can he understand the exalted position of the devotees of the Lord. Kåñëa is so glorious that Kåñëa's intimate associates must also be glorious. But this is unknown to a kaniñöha-adhikäré. Similarly, the essential qualification of a Vaiñëava, which is to offer all respects to others (amäninä manädena kértanéyaù sadä hariù  is also conspicuous by its absence in a kaniñöha-adhikäré. If such a person, however, has faith in the Vedic literatures and tries to understand the statements of Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, he will gradually be elevated to the second—and first-class stages of devotional service."

The Deity is a particular incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Kåñëa can present Himself before the worshiper in five different manifestations, namely His original form as Kåñëa (para), His quadruple expansions (vyüha), His pastime incarnations (vaibhava), the Supersoul (antaryämé) and the Deity (arcä). Within the Deity form (arcä) is the Supersoul, who in turn is included within the Lord's pastime forms (vaibhava). The Supreme Lord's vaibhava-prakäça is an emanation from the catur-vyüha. This quadruple expansion of the Lord is situated within the supreme truth, Väsudeva, who Himself is situated within the svayaà-prakäça-tattva. This svayaà-prakäça consists of expansions of the ultimate svayaà-rüpa-tattva, the original form of Kåñëa within Goloka Våndävana in the spiritual sky. This hierarchy of the expansions of the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world is realized even within the material world in terms of one's eagerness to render service to the Lord. A beginner in the lowest stage of devotional service should try to dedicate all his activities to the satisfaction of the Lord and cultivate the worship of Kåñëa in the temple."

Although the vaibhava, or pastime expansions, of the Lord incarnate at specific times (rämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan (BS 5.39)), the Supersoul and Deity forms are constantly available for the spiritual advancement of the devotees in this world. As one comes to the madhyama-adhikäré platform, one is able to understand the expansions of the Supreme Lord, whereas the kaniñöha-adhikäré's entire knowledge of the Lord is limited to the Deity. Nonetheless, Kåñëa is so kind that to encourage even the lowest class of Vaiñëavas He condenses all of His various forms into the Deity so that by worshiping the Deity the kaniñöha-adhikäré devotee is worshiping all the forms of the Lord. As the devotee makes advancement, he can understand these forms as they appear in their own way, both within this world and in the spiritual sky."

Çréla Prabhupäda often said that only the impersonalist desires to see Kåñëa alone; we desire to see Kåñëa with His cows, His friends, His parents, His gopés, His flute, jewelry, forest scenery and so on. Kåñëa is gorgeous in the setting of Våndävana. It is in the land of Våndävana that Lord Kåñëa, surrounded by so many beautiful associates, manifests His exalted indescribable beauty. Similarly, the unique mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is exhibited in the activities of His pure devotees who selflessly travel around the universe distributing the dust particles from Kåñëa's lotus feet on the heads of the conditioned souls. One who is uninterested in the Lord's paraphernalia, entourage and devotees has a stunted conception of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

He then exhibits loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and makes friendship with the devotees who are the dearmost sons of the Lord, and by appreciating the universal quality of devotional service to Kåñëa he becomes very much eager to engage other innocent people in the service of the Lord. Further, as he begins to make significant advancement he becomes inimical to anything or anyone that hinders the progress of his devotional life, and thus he avoids atheistic people who cannot benefit by good instruction."
