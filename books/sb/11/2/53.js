    "translation": "The lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are sought even by the greatest of demigods, such as Brahmä and Çiva, who have all accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their life and soul. A pure devotee of the Lord can never forget those lotus feet in any circumstance. He will not give up his shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord for a single moment—indeed, not for half a moment—even in exchange for the benediction of ruling and enjoying the opulence of the entire universe. Such a devotee of the Lord is to be considered the best of the Vaiñëavas.",

It is simply impossible for a pure devotee to forget the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, since everything that exists is in fact an expansion of the Supreme Lord. Since nothing is separate from the Supreme Lord, a pure devotee of the Lord cannot think of anything but the Lord. Nor can a pure devotee contemplate ruling or enjoying universal opulence; even if given all the opulence of the universe, he would immediately offer it at the lotus feet of the Lord and return to his position of a humble servant of the Lord."

The lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa are so opulent that even the lords of all material opulence, namely Brahmä and Çiva, as well as the other demigods, are always searching for a glimpse of the Lord's lotus feet. The word vimågyät indicates that the demigods are not actually able to see the lotus feet of the Lord, but are endeavoring to see them. An example of this is given in the Tenth Canto when Lord Brahmä offers prayers to Viñëu, begging the Lord to rectify the disturbances on the earth."

Such disturbances, however, cannot exist within the mind of a pure devotee of the Lord, as indicated in this verse by the word akuëöha-småti. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, we can understand from this verse that since none of the material facilities available in any of the universal planetary systems can distract a pure devotee of the Lord, such a devotee can never possibly fall or become inimical to the Lord's service."
