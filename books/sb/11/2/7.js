Närada might have thought that since Vasudeva was already perfect in Kåñëa consciousness there was no need to instruct him in the process of devotional service. Therefore, anticipating Närada's possible reluctance, Vasudeva specifically requested Närada to preach to him about devotional service to Kåñëa. This is the symptom of a pure devotee. A pure devotee of Kåñëa never considers himself exalted. To the contrary, he meekly feels that his devotional service is most imperfect but that somehow or other Lord Kåñëa, out of His causeless mercy, is accepting such imperfect service. Caitanya Mahäprabhu has stated in this regard,"

One should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and ready to offer all respect to others.\" (Çikñäñöaka 3) The conditioned souls in this material world become falsely proud of their so-called family lineage. This pride is false because one who has taken birth in the material world is in a fallen situation, even in the best of cases. Vasudeva, however, was certainly not fallen, since he had taken birth in the family of Kåñëa. Since he was Kåñëa's father, his position was most exalted, yet because he was a pure devotee he did not become proud of his special relationship with Kåñëa. Instead, considering himself deficient in spiritual understanding, he took advantage of the appearance of Närada Muni, a great preacher of Kåñëa consciousness, by immediately inquiring from him about devotional service. This incomparable humility of a pure devotee of Kåñëa is far superior to the false humility of the impersonalist, who actually maintains a desire to be equal to God though adopting the external behavior of a meek and saintly person."

            "content": "Bhayam, or fear, is caused by seeing something other than Kåñëa (dvitéyäbhiniveçataù). Everything is actually an emanation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated in Vedänta-sutra (janmädy asya yataù ). If a living being gives up his misguided attempt to defy the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to the Lord, certainly he becomes confident in his eternal relationship with Kåñëa. A surrendered soul can actually experience that Kåñëa is his well-wishing friend, and since that friend is the supreme absolute controller of all existence, there is certainly no cause for fear. The son of a rich man certainly feels confident while touring the estate of his father. Similarly, an empowered representative of the government feels confident in the discharge of his duty. In the same way, a devotee of Kåñëa, acting as a representative of the Supreme Lord, feels confident because he can understand at every moment that the entire material and spiritual creation is strictly under the control of his benevolent master. The nondevotee, however, denies the supreme position of Kåñëa and therefore imagines that something is different from Kåñëa. For example, if a servant of the government thinks that there is some dangerous obstacle that cannot be controlled by the government's power, he becomes fearful. If a child feels that there is some power that cannot be subdued by his father, then he becomes fearful. Similarly, because we artificially think that there is something within existence that is not under the strict control of the benevolent Lord, we become fearful. Such a concept of a second thing (something other than Kåñëa) is called dvitéyäbhiniveça, and it immediately creates a foreign atmosphere of bhayam, or fear. Kåñëa is called abhayaìkara, which means that He destroys all fear in the heart of His devotee."

            "content": "Sometimes so-called scholars, distraught after many years of impersonal speculation and enjoyment of materialistic life, become fearful and anxious. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté compares such disturbed philosophers to the bound vulture in the Chändogya Upaniñad. Desiring liberation from fear, such speculators unfortunately concoct an imaginary liberation (vimukta-mäninaù) and try to take shelter of impersonal spiritual existence or voidness. But the Bhägavatam  states, äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù/ patanty adho 'nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù: because such speculators have not rectified their original mistake of rejecting their eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they fall from their concocted liberation and thus remain in a fearful condition. Vasudeva, however, is openly eager to hear more and more about devotional service to Kåñëa, and therefore he states, yän çrutvä çraddhayä martyo mucyate sarvato bhayät: simply by hearing about pure devotional service to Kåñëa, a conditioned soul can easily free himself from all types of fear, and this transcendental freedom is certainly eternal."
