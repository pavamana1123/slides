Such Vedic knowledge is based on the varëäçrama system, which scientifically divides human society into four occupational divisions as well as four spiritual divisions. According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, however, knowledge that can bring one directly in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called ati-rahasyam, or the most confidential knowledge (ati-rahasyatvät sva-mukhenaiva bhagavatäviduñäm api puàsäm aïjaù sukhenaivätma-labdhaye)."

The essence of bhägavata-dharma is given in Bhagavad-gétä, wherein Kåñëa personally instructs Arjuna. Yet in the Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam the Lord will give instructions to Uddhava that surpass even the teachings given to Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä. As Çréla Prabhupäda has stated, \"Undoubtedly Bhagavad-gétä was spoken by the Lord on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra just to encourage Arjuna to fight, and yet to complete the transcendental knowledge of Bhagavad-gétä the Lord instructed Uddhava. The Lord wanted Uddhava to fulfill His mission and disseminate knowledge which He had not spoken even in Bhagavad-gétä.\"  Similarly, it is understood that the knowledge that will be presented here by the nine Yogendras is not their personal concoction but is authorized knowledge originally spoken by the Lord Himself."

But when they hear the eternally auspicious topics spoken by the Supreme Lord for their benefit and understand their eternal identities as spirit souls, the realized experience of being an eternal servant of Kåñëa becomes the basis of bhägavata-dharma. In the soul's experience as a pure Vaiñëava, or servant of God, there is no consideration of being different from God or the same as God, nor is one interested in the kingdom of material sense gratification. The pure devotee simply perceives his particular devotional service to the Supreme Lord and sees himself as an individual part and parcel of the ultimate shelter. A pure devotee experiences that his very being is tied, by ropes of loving devotion, to the ultimate shelter Himself in one of His direct personal expansions. And in such a perfect state of consciousness, the devotee can perceive the all-pervading variegated forms of the Absolute Truth."
