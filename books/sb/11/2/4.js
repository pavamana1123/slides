Kåpaëänäm refers to the most wretched persons, whereas uttama-çloka-vartmanäm refers to the most fortunate, those who are advanced in Kåñëa consciousness. Çrédhara Svämé has stated, tathä bhagavad-rüpasya bhavato yäträ sarva-dehinäm svastaya iti. The word bhagavad-rüpasya indicates that Närada Muni is an expansion of the Supreme Lord and that his activities therefore bring immense benefit for all living beings. In the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Närada Muni is described as a manifestation of the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There it is stated that Närada is especially empowered to give instructions in the art of devotional service to Kåñëa. Närada is especially able to advise the conditioned souls as to how they can dovetail their present activities with the devotional service of Kåñëa without unnecessarily disrupting their present life."

Etad akñaraà gärgi aviditväsmäl lokät praiti sa kåpaëaù: \"O daughter of Gargäcärya, he who leaves this world without learning about the infallible Supreme is a kåpaëa, or miser.\" In other words, we are awarded the human form of life so that we may understand our eternal, blissful relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As indicated in verse 2 of this chapter by the word indriyavän, the human body is specifically awarded so that we may serve the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa. This human form of body is the greatest fortune because the highly evolved intelligence of human life enables us to understand Kåñëa, the Absolute Truth. If we are unable to understand our eternal relationship with God, we shall derive no permanent benefit whatsoever in this present life, nor can we ultimately benefit others. One who receives a great treasure but can neither use it himself nor dedicate it to the happiness of others is called a miser. Therefore, a person who leaves this world without having understood his actual position as servant of God is called a kåpaëa, or miser."

            "content": "This verse states that Närada Muni is so empowered in the devotional service of Kåñëa that he can lift even miserly rascals out of their illusion, just as a kind father goes to his child and wakes him from a distressing nightmare. Our present materialistic life is just like a troublesome dream, from which great souls such as Närada can wake us. Närada Muni is so powerful that even those already advanced in devotional service to Kåñëa can greatly enhance their spiritual position by hearing his instructions, as they will be given here in the Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Therefore Çré Närada is the guru and father of all living beings, who are originally devotees of the Lord but who are now artificially attempting to enjoy the material world in the material bodies of human beings, animals, and so on."
