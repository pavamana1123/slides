Çréla Jéva Gosvämé states that from the anxiety of Vasudeva, which is expressed in this verse by the words apüjayaà na mokñäya mohito deva-mäyayä, it is to be discerned that Vasudeva had heard of the curse of the brähmaëas at Piëòäraka against the Yadu dynasty and that he could understand from this curse that the Lord's disappearance from the earth was imminent. Vasudeva understood that the Lord's manifest pastimes within this universe were coming to an end, and he now lamented that he had not directly taken advantage of the opportunity to worship Kåñëa to go back home, back to Godhead."

            "content": "Significantly, Vasudeva has used the word mukti-dam to describe the Lord. Mukti-dam is a synonym of Mukunda, or that personality who can give liberation from the cycle of birth and death. It is stated in Vedic literature that even the demigods are bound to the cycle of birth and death, although their life span is inconceivably long by earthly calculations. It is the almighty God alone who can free the conditioned soul from the reactions to his previous sinful activities and award him an eternal life of bliss and knowledge."

            "content": "Vasudeva lamented that he had desired Kåñëa to come to him as a son instead of desiring to go back to Kåñëa, back to Godhead, to serve the Lord in the spiritual sky. Commenting on this incident in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Çréla Prabhupäda has emphasized that we should desire to go back home, back to Godhead, rather than try to bring the Lord to this world as our son. Nor can we artificially imitate the severe penances Vasudeva and Devaké performed for thousands of heavenly years in their previous births as Sutapä and Påçni. In this connection Çréla Prabhupäda states, \"If we want to get the Supreme Personality of Godhead to become one of us in this material world, this requires great penance, but if we want to go back to Kåñëa (tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti mäm eti so 'rjuna Although Vasudeva and Devaké desired that Kåñëa become their son, it should be understood that they are devotees eternally situated in love of Kåñëa. As stated by the Lord Himself  the great sage Atri Muni prayed to the Lord, prajäm ätma-samäà mahyaà prayacchatu: \"Kindly be pleased to offer me a son exactly like You.\" Atri Muni said he wanted a son exactly like the Lord, and therefore he was not a pure devotee, because he had a desire to be fulfilled and that desire was material. If he had desired the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his child, he would have been completely free of material desires because he would have wanted the Supreme Absolute Truth, but because he wanted a similar child, his desire was material. Thus Atri Muni cannot be counted among the pure devotees. Vasudeva and Devaké, however, did want the Lord Himself, and therefore they were pure devotees of the Lord. In this verse, therefore, Vasudeva's statement apüjayaà na mokñäya mohito deva-mäyayä should be taken to mean that Kåñëa's internal potency bewildered Vasudeva so that he would desire Kåñëa as his son. This paved the way for the Lord's appearance as the son of His loving devotees."
