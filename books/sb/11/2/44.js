What are the natural symptoms by which I can distinguish between the most advanced devotees, those on the middle level and those who are neophytes?

            "content": "According to Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, kåñëeti yasya giri taà manasädriyeta: \"One should mentally honor any devotee who chants the holy name of Lord Kåñëa.\" (Upadeçämåta 5) Any living entity who is faithfully chanting the holy name of Kåñëa is to be considered a Vaiñëava and at least within the mind is to be offered respect. But for practical advancement in Kåñëa consciousness one should associate at least with a second-class devotee. And if one can receive the mercy of a first-class devotee of the Lord, one's perfection is very easily guaranteed. Thus Nimi Mahäräja is humbly inquiring, \"What are the character, behavior and speech of devotees?\" The King wants to know the particular symptoms of body, mind and speech by which the different categories uttama-adhikäré, madhyama-adhikäré and kaniñöha-adhikäré are clearly identified. In response to the King's inquiry, another of the nava-yogendras, namely Havir, will give a further elaboration of the science of Kåñëa consciousness."
