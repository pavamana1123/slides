Pareçänubhava (experience of the Supreme Lord) and puñöi (nourishment) are analogous because both sustain one's life. Finally, virakti (detachment) and kñud-apäya (cessation of hunger) may be compared because both free one from further hankering so that one may experience çänti, or peace."

On the other hand, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, although one who is experiencing the blissful Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, becomes uninterested in anything other than Kåñëa, his attachment to Kåñëa increases at every moment. Therefore it is to be understood that the transcendental beauty and qualities of the Supreme Lord are not material, since one never becomes satiated by relishing the bliss of the Supreme Lord."

Virakti means \"detachment,\" whereas tyäga means \"renunciation.\" According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the word renunciation can be used in a situation in which one considers giving up an enjoyable object. But by considering everything to be potential paraphernalia in the service of Lord Kåñëa, as described in the previous verse, one need not give thought to renunciation, for one uses everything in the proper way in the service of the Lord.

            "content": "The very pleasant analogy of a good meal is given in this verse. A hungry man busily consuming a sumptuous plate of food is not interested in anything else happening around him. In fact, he considers any other topic or activity a disturbance to his concentration on the delicious meal. Similarly, as one advances in Kåñëa consciousness one considers anything unrelated to the devotional service of Kåñëa an obnoxious disturbance. Such concentrated love of Godhead has been described in the Second Canto of the Bhägavatam by the words tévreëa bhakti-yogena yajeta puruñaà param . One should not make an artificial show of renouncing the material world; rather, one should systematically train the mind to see everything as an expansion of the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as a hungry materialistic man, upon seeing sumptuous food, immediately desires to put it in his mouth, an advanced devotee of Kåñëa, upon seeing a material object, immediately becomes eager to use it for the pleasure of Kåñëa. Without the spontaneous hunger to engage everything in the service of Kåñëa and to dive deeper and deeper into the ocean of love of Kåñëa, so-called realization of God or loose talk about so-called religious life is irrelevant to the actual experience of entering the kingdom of God."

The Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, is so merciful that when a living entity understands that the personality Kåñëa is the source of everything and surrenders to the Lord, Kåñëa personally takes charge of him and reveals to him within his heart that he is under the Lord's full protection. Thus devotion, direct experience of the Personality of Godhead, and detachment from other objects become manifest even in the beginning stage of bhakti-yoga, since bhakti-yoga begins at the point of liberation. Other processes have as their final goal salvation or liberation, but according to Bhagavad-gétä ,"
