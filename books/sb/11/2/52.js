    "translation": "When a devotee gives up the selfish conception by which one thinks \"This is my property, and that is his,\" and when he is no longer concerned with the pleasures of his own material body or indifferent to the discomforts of others, he becomes fully peaceful and satisfied. He considers himself simply one among all the living beings who are equally part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a satisfied Vaiñëava is considered to be at the highest standard of devotional service.",

            "content": "\"Under no circumstance should one consider the living entity equal to Lord Viñëu, either in conditional life or in liberation.\" The impersonal speculative philosophers are fond of imagining that although in our present illusion we appear to be individual entities, at liberation we shall all merge into God and be God. Such wishful thinkers cannot reasonably explain how the omnipotent God could arrive at the embarrassing position of having to enter a yoga studio, pay weekly fees, press His nose and chant mantras to regain His divinity. As stated in the Vedas, nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13). The individuality or plurality of living entities is not a product of material existence. The word nityänäm, denoting the plurality of eternal entities, clearly indicates that the living entities are eternally individual parts and parcels of the Lord, who is the singular unique entity described here as ekaù. In Bhagavad-gétä  Arjuna said to Kåñëa, rathaà sthäpaya me 'cyuta: \"My dear Acyuta, please place my chariot between the armies.\" This body is also ratha, a vehicle, and therefore the best policy is to request the infallible Lord to take charge of our conditioned body and guide us on the path back to the kingdom of God. The word acyuta means \"the infallible\" or \"one who never falls.\" Learned or sane human beings will not entertain the silly notion that the omnipotent, omniscient God has slipped and fallen because of mäyä. No amount of wishful thinking can erase our eternal servitorship at the lotus feet of the Lord."

            "content": "According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé and Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, this verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam does not forbid using a particular object in the Lord's service, since a devotee is free to use anything favorable for serving Lord Kåñëa. This acceptance of favorable objects in the service of Kåñëa is called yukta-vairägya. As stated by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, nirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe: one should be attached for Kåñëa's sake, never for one's own sake. If one interprets this verse to indicate that one should not exercise control over any material object, even if it is favorable for serving Kåñëa, one falls into the bad understanding called phalgu-vairägya, or immature renunciation. Great kings such as Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and Mahäräja Parékñit engaged the entire earth, and other Vaiñëavas have engaged the entire universe in the service of Kåñëa. But they completely gave up the sense of their personal proprietorship. That is the point made in this verse. Just as one becomes very much concerned about any pain in one's own body, one should be concerned with bringing the conditioned souls to the platform of devotional service so that all of their suffering will be banished forever. That is the actual purport of not distinguishing between one body and another."
