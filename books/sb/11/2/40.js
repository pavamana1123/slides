    "translation": "By chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord, one comes to the stage of love of Godhead. Then the devotee is fixed in his vow as an eternal servant of the Lord, and he gradually becomes very much attached to a particular name and form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As his heart melts with ecstatic love, he laughs very loudly or cries or shouts. Sometimes he sings and dances like a madman, for he is indifferent to public opinion.",

Grab Him! Keep Him away!' Hearing these menacing words spoken by the elderly gopé Jaraté, Kåñëa immediately prepares to leave the house. The devotee to whom this transcendental pastime is revealed laughs in ecstasy. But suddenly he can no longer see Kåñëa. He then cries in great lamentation, 'Oh! I achieved the greatest fortune in the world, and now it has suddenly slipped from my hands!' Thus the devotee cries loudly, 'So my Lord! Where are You? Give me Your answer!' The Lord answers, 'My dear devotee, I heard your loud complaint, and so I have again come before you.' Upon seeing Lord Kåñëa again, the devotee begins to sing, 'Today my life has become perfect.' Thus overwhelmed with transcendental bliss, he begins to dance like a madman.\""
