(See Appendix). In this regard the äcärya has further explained that because the living entities must suffer the reactions to their sinful activities, the Lord arranges for them to be punished during the Kali-yuga. In other words, it is not Lord Kåñëa's desire that conditioned souls be sinful and suffer, but since they are already sinful, the Lord creates an appropriate age during which they can experience the bitter fruits of irreligiosity."

            "content": "Since Lord Kåñëa personally establishes religious principles in His various appearances in this material world, at the end of Dväpara-yuga religion on the earth was overwhelmingly powerful. All the significant demons had been killed; the great sages, saints and devotees had been greatly encouraged, enlightened and fortified; and there was little scope for irreligion. Had Lord Kåñëa ascended to the spiritual sky in His spiritual body before the eyes of the world, it would have been very difficult for Kali-yuga to flourish. Lord Kåñëa left the world in exactly that way during His appearance as Rämacandra, and hundreds of thousands of years later, hundreds of millions of pious persons still discuss this wonderful pastime of the Lord. To pave the way for Kali-yuga, however, Lord Kåñëa left this world in a way that puzzles those who are not His staunch devotees."

Yet although Lord Kåñëa's eternal, spiritual form is a realized fact for advanced devotees, for those who are weak in Kåñëa consciousness the inconceivable pastimes and plan of the Lord are sometimes hard to appreciate properly."
