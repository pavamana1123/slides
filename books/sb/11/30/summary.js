They followed His advice and went to Prabhäsa. There they became absorbed in festivity, and by the illusory power of Lord Kåñëa they became intoxicated from drinking liquor. Thus losing their intelligence, they quarreled among themselves and began killing one another, until not a man was left alive."

Seeing the disappearance of Baladeva, Lord Çré Kåñëa sat down silently upon the ground. Then a hunter named Jarä, mistaking the sole of the Lord's left foot for a deer, pierced it with an arrow. The hunter immediately understood his mistake and, falling at the feet of Lord Çré Kåñëa, begged to be punished. In reply Lord Kåñëa told the hunter that what he had done was actually according to His own desire. The Lord then sent the hunter to Vaikuëöha."

Kåñëa told him that he should go to Dvärakä, inform the residents about the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty, and advise them all to leave Dvärakä for Indraprastha. Däruka obediently carried out this order."
