Because Lord Kåñëa was playing the part of an ordinary member of the Yadu dynasty, He appeared to react to the curse of the brähmaëas by giving up His earthly pastimes. Lord Kåñëa cannot actually be cursed by anyone. Närada Muni and the other sages who cursed the Yadu dynasty are eternal devotees of Lord Kåñëa and could hardly curse Him. Therefore, in giving up His pastimes and leaving the earth with the Yadu dynasty, Lord Kåñëa demonstrated His internal potency and personal will, since no one can challenge the supreme potency of the Personality of Godhead."
