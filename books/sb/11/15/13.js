    "translation": "Fixing his mind completely in Me within the element of false ego generated from the mode of goodness, the yogé obtains the power of mystic acquisition, by which he becomes the proprietor of the senses of all living entities. He obtains such perfection because his mind is absorbed in Me.",

Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura states that those who pursue such perfections without fixing the mind in the Supreme Lord acquire a gross and inferior reflection of each mystic potency. Those who are not conscious of the Lord cannot actually synchronize their minds perfectly with the universal functions and therefore cannot elevate their mystic opulences to the universal platform."
