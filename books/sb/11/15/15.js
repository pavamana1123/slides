            "content": "We should remember that mystic perfection never enables a living entity to challenge the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead. In fact, one cannot obtain such perfections without the mercy of the Supreme Lord; thus one's controlling power can never disturb the plan of Lord Kåñëa. One is allowed to exhibit mystic control only within the confines of the law of God, and even a great yogé who transgresses the law of God by his so-called mystic opulences will be severely punished, as revealed in the story of Durväsä Muni cursing Ambaréña Mahäräja."
