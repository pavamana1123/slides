    "translation": "The power to know past, present and future; tolerance of heat, cold and other dualities; knowing the minds of others; checking the influence of fire, sun, water, poison, and so on; and remaining unconquered by others—these constitute five perfections of the mystic process of yoga and meditation. I am simply listing these here according to their names and characteristics. Now please learn from Me how specific mystic perfections arise from specific meditations and also of the particular processes involved.",

According to Çréla Madhväcärya, in the perfection called agny-arkämbu-viñädénäà pratiñöambhaù, or checking the influence of fire, sun, water, poison, and so on, the term \"and so on\" refers to one's remaining invulnerable to all types of weapons as well as attacks by nails, teeth, beating, curses and other such sources."
