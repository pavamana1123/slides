            "content": "This perfection is called käma-rüpa, or the ability to assume any form that one desires, even the form of a demigod. The pure devotees absorb their minds in a particular type of service to Lord Kåñëa and thus gradually assume a spiritual body for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. Thus anyone who takes to the process of chanting the holy names of Kåñëa and follows the regulative principles of human life can acquire the ultimate perfection of käma-rüpa, assuming an eternal, spiritual body in the kingdom of God."
