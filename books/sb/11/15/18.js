Within the material world Lord Viñëu, addressed here as çvetadvépa-pati, the Lord of Çvetadvépa, governs the material mode of goodness and is thus called çuddha and dharma-maya, or the personification of purity and piety. By worshiping Lord Viñëu as the personification of material goodness one obtains the material benediction of freedom from bodily disturbance."
