Thus Lord Kåñëa is not merely the Lord of material yoga perfections, but of the highest liberated perfections as well. One can obtain säìkhya, or knowledge leading to liberation, by performing pious activities, and Lord Kåñëa is also the cause, protector and Lord of such activities as well as of the learned teachers who instruct ordinary people in the means of piety. In many different ways Lord Kåñëa is the real object of meditation and worship for every living entity. Lord Kåñëa through the expansion of His potencies is everything, and this simple understanding, called Kåñëa consciousness, is the supreme perfection of the yoga system."
