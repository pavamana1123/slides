Similarly, for one skilled in the techniques of yoga, fending off attacks by weapons, fire, poison, and so on, is a recreational activity. Prahläda Mahäräja was attacked by his father in all these ways, but because of his perfect Kåñëa consciousness he was not injured. The pure devotees of the Lord depend fully on the mercy of Lord Kåñëa, who possesses mystic opulences to an infinite degree and is therefore known as Yogeçvara, the master of all mystic power. Because devotees are always connected to Lord Kåñëa, they do not feel any need to separately develop powers already possessed unlimitedly by their Lord, master and protector."

Similarly, the conditioned souls have fallen into the ocean of material existence and are drowning in the reactions to their sinful activities, whereas the devotees recognize this world to be the potency of the Lord and enjoy pleasurable pastimes within it by fully engaging in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa."
