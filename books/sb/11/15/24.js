    "translation": "The yogé who has achieved the mystic perfection called svacchanda-måtyu blocks the anus with the heel of the foot and then lifts the soul from the heart to the chest, to the neck and finally to the head. Situated within the brahma-randhra, the yogé then gives up his material body and guides the spirit soul to the selected destination.",

According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the term brahma, as used in this verse, is an example of upalakñaëa, or the use of a general term to indicate various concepts. Brahma here indicates the particular destination selected by the yogé, namely the spiritual sky, the impersonal brahmajyoti or any other destination that has attracted the yogé's mind."
