    "translation": "Among the eight primary mystic perfections, the three by which one transforms one's own body are aëimä, becoming smaller than the smallest; mahimä, becoming greater than the greatest; and laghimä, becoming lighter than the lightest. Through the perfection of präpti one acquires whatever one desires, and through präkämya-siddhi one experiences any enjoyable object, either in this world or the next. Through içitä-siddhi one can manipulate the subpotencies of mäyä, and through the controlling potency called vaçitä-siddhi one is unimpeded by the three modes of nature. One who has acquired kämävasäyitä-siddhi can obtain anything from anywhere, to the highest possible limit. My dear gentle Uddhava, these eight mystic perfections are considered to be naturally existing and unexcelled within this world.",

            "content": "Through aëimä-siddhi one can become so small that one can enter a stone or pass through any obstacle. Through mahimä-siddhi one becomes so great that one covers everything, and through laghimä one becomes so light that one can ride on the sun's rays into the sun planet. Through präpti-siddhi one can acquire anything from anywhere and can even touch the moon with one's finger. By this mystic perfection one can also enter into the senses of any other living entity through the predominating deities of the particular senses; and by thus utilizing the senses of others, one can acquire anything. Through präkämya one can experience any enjoyable object, either in this world or the next, and through éçitä, or the controlling potency, one can manipulate the subpotencies of mäyä, which are material. In other words, even by acquiring mystic powers one cannot pass beyond the control of illusion; however, one may manipulate the subpotencies of illusion. Through vaçitä, or the power to control, one can bring others under one's dominion or keep oneself beyond the control of the three modes of nature. Ultimately, one acquires through kämävasäyitä the maximum powers of control, acquisition and enjoyment. The word autpattikäù in this verse indicates being original, natural and unexcelled. These eight mystic potencies originally exist in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, in the superlative degree. Lord Kåñëa becomes so small that He enters within the atomic particles, and He becomes so large that as Mahä-Viñëu He breathes out millions of universes. The Lord can become so light or subtle that even great mystic yogés cannot perceive Him, and the Lord's acquisitive power is perfect, because He keeps the total existence eternally within His body. The Lord certainly can enjoy whatever He likes, control all energies, dominate all other persons and exhibit complete omnipotency. Therefore it is to be understood that these eight mystic perfections are insignificant expansions of the mystic potency of the Lord, who in Bhagavad-gétä is called Yogeçvara, the Supreme Lord of all mystic potencies. These eight perfections are not artificial, but are natural and unexcelled because they originally exist in the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
