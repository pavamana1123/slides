There are many books giving proper guidance for achieving Lord Kåñëa, and the following are mentioned: Çréla Jéva Gosvämé's Saìkalpa-kalpavåkña, Çréla Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja's Çré Govinda-lélämåta, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté's Çré Kåñëa-bhävanämåta and Saìkalpa-kalpadruma, and Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura's Çré Gauräìga-smaraëa-maìgala. In the modern age, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda has given us over sixty large volumes of transcendental literature, which can fix us firmly on the path back home, back to Godhead. Our saìkalpa, or determination, should be practical and not useless. We should resolve to make a permanent solution to the problems of life by going back home, back to Godhead."
