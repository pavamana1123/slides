According to Çréla Véraräghava Äcärya, turéya also indicates that the Lord is beyond the three ordinary phases of consciousness, namely wakefulness, dreaming and dreamless sleep. Bhaga-vac-chabda-çabdite indicates that the Lord is known as Bhagavän, or the possessor of unlimited opulences, principally beauty, fame, wealth, knowledge, renunciation and intelligence."
