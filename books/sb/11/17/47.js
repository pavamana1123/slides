    "translation": "If a brähmaëa cannot support himself through his regular duties and is thus suffering, he may adopt the occupation of a merchant and overcome his destitute condition by buying and selling material things. If he continues to suffer extreme poverty even as a merchant, then he may adopt the occupation of a kñatriya, taking sword in hand. But he cannot in any circumstances become like a dog, accepting an ordinary master.",

A destitute brähmaëa who is suffering intolerably may become a merchant and then a kñatriya but may never take the position of a çüdra by working in a company or accepting a master. Although a kñatriya is ordinarily considered more elevated than a vaiçya, the Lord here recommends that distressed brähmaëas first accept the vaiçya occupation, since it is not violent."
