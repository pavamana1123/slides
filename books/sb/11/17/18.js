            "content": "Atuñöir arthopacayaiù indicates that a vaiçya is never satisfied with any amount of wealth and always wants to accumulate more. On the other hand, he is däna-niñöha, or dedicated to charitable work; brahmasevé, always engaged in assisting the brähmaëas; and adambha, free from hypocrisy. This is due to ästikyam, or complete faith in the Vedic way of life, and confidence that one will be rewarded or punished in the next life for one's present activities. The fervent desire of the vaiçyas to accumulate wealth is not the same as ordinary material greed, because it is purified and tempered by the superior qualities mentioned in this verse."
