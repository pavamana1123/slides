The Lord appears in the process of threefold Vedic sacrifice. The three divisions are understood as follows. The hotä priest offers oblations into the fire and chants the Åg Veda; the udgätä priest chants the Säma Veda; and the adhvaryu priest, who arranges the sacrificial ground, altar, etc., chants the Yajur Veda. In Tretä-yuga such sacrifice is the authorized process for spiritual perfection. The word präëät in this verse refers to the universal form of the Personality of Godhead. This form is further described in the following verses."
