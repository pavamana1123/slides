One who is not surrendered to Me should move progressively from one äçrama to another, never acting otherwise.",

            "content": "Those who are not surrendered devotees of the Lord must rigidly observe the regulations governing one's authorized social status. There are four social divisions of life, namely brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. One who wants to fulfill material desires should become an ordinary householder (gåhastha), establish a comfortable residence and maintain his family. One desiring to accelerate the process of purification may give up his home and business and live in a sacred place with his wife, as indicated here by the word vanam, or \"forest.\" There are many sacred forests in India meant for this purpose, such as Våndävana and Mäyäpur. The word dvijottama indicates the brähmaëas. Brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas are all dvija, or initiated in the Gäyatré mantra, but the brähmaëa is dvijottama, or the highest among those who have received second birth by spiritual initiation. It is recommended that a purified brähmaëa take to the renounced order of life (sannyäsa), giving up further contact with his so-called wife. The brähmaëa is specifically mentioned here, since kñatriyas and vaiçyas are not to take the renounced order of life. Even so, there are many stories in the Bhägavatam wherein great kings retire with their aristocratic wives to the forest to practice the austerities of vänaprastha and thus accelerate the process of purification. The brähmaëas, however, may directly accept the renounced order of life."

            "content": "The words äçramäd äçramaà gacchet indicate that one may progressively move from brahmacäré life to gåhastha life to vänaprastha life and then to sannyäsa. The words äçramäd äçramam emphasize that one should never remain without an authorized social status, nor should one go backward, falling down from a higher position. Those who are not surrendered devotees of the Lord must rigidly observe such injunctions, for otherwise they will quickly become degraded, and their sins will place them outside the bounds of authorized human civilization."

            "content": "Lord Kåñëa emphasizes here that a nondevotee must rigidly observe the rituals and regulations of Vedic social divisions, whereas the Lord's pure devotee, engaged twenty-four hours a day in Lord Kåñëa's mission, is transcendental to such divisions. If, however, one performs illicit activities on the strength of being transcendental to Vedic social divisions, one is revealed to be a materialistic neophyte and not an advanced devotee of the Lord. An advanced devotee, who remains aloof from material sense gratification, is not bound by the Vedic social divisions; thus even a householder may live very austerely, traveling and preaching Kåñëa consciousness away from home, and even a sannyäsé may sometimes engage women in the devotional service of Lord Kåñëa. The most advanced devotees cannot be restricted by the rituals and regulations of the varëäçrama system, and they move freely around the world distributing love of Godhead. Mat-para indicates a pure devotee of the Lord who always keeps the Lord fixed in his heart and consciousness. One who falls down to become a victim of sense gratification is not fully established on the platform of mat-para and should rigidly observe the social divisions and regulations to remain steady on the platform of pious human life."
