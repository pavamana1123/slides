Or if he has a responsible son to take over his family duties, he may take sannyäsa, the renounced order, for a definitive solution to the problems of life. In all three äçramas, ultimate success depends on sincere surrender to the Supreme Lord; therefore, the most important qualification one can have is Kåñëa consciousness."
