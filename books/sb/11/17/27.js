He was specifically instructing how a brahmacäré should behave under the care of a spiritual master. A spiritual master is not an enjoyer of facilities offered by his disciples. He is like a parent. Without the attentive service of his parents, a child cannot grow to manhood; similarly, without the care of the spiritual master one cannot rise to the plane of transcendental service."

            "content": "\"The spiritual master is also called äcärya, or a transcendental professor of spiritual science. Manu-saàhitä (2.140) explains the duties of an äcärya, describing that a bona fide spiritual maser accepts charge of disciples, teaches them the Vedic knowledge with all its intricacies, and gives them their second birth. The ceremony performed to initiate a disciple into the study of spiritual science is called upanéti, or the function that brings one nearer to the spiritual master. One who cannot be brought nearer to a spiritual master cannot have a sacred thread, and thus he is indicated to be a çüdra. The sacred thread worn on the body of a brähmaëa, kñatriya or vaiçya is a symbol of initiation by the spiritual master; it is worth nothing if worn merely to boast of high parentage. The duty of the spiritual master is to initiate a disciple with the sacred thread ceremony, and after this saàskära, or purificatory process, the spiritual master actually begins to teach the disciple about the Vedas. A person born a çüdra is not barred from such spiritual initiation, provided he is approved by the spiritual master, who is duly authorized to award a disciple the right to be a brähmaëa if he finds him perfectly qualified. In the Väyu Puräëa an äcärya is defined as one who knows the import of all the Vedic literatures, abides by their rules and regulations, and teaches his disciples to act in the same way."

Therefore in the dealings of an äcärya there are no activities but those of transcendental loving service to the Lord. He is the Supreme Personality of Servitor Godhead. It is worthwhile to take shelter of such a steady devotee, who is called äçraya-vigraha, or the manifestation or form of the Lord of whom one must take shelter."

The bona fide spiritual master always engages in unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By this test he is known to be a direct manifestation of the Lord and a genuine representative of Çré Nityänanda Prabhu. Such a spiritual master is known as äcäryadeva. Influenced by an envious temperament and dissatisfied because of an attitude of sense gratification, mundaners criticize a real äcärya. In fact, however, a bona fide äcärya is nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead, and therefore to envy such an äcärya is to envy the Personality of Godhead Himself. This will produce an effect subversive to transcendental realization."

False spiritual masters pose themselves as identical with Çré Kåñëa in every respect, to exploit the sentiments of their disciples, but such impersonalists can only mislead their disciples, for their ultimate aim is to become one with the Lord. This is against the principles of the devotional cult."

Çréla Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé confirms that this is the real position of a bona fide spiritual master and says that one should always think of the spiritual master in terms of his intimate relationship with Mukunda (Çré Kåñëa). Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, in his Bhakti-sandarbha (213), has clearly defined that a pure devotee's observation of the spiritual master and Lord Çiva as one with the Personality of Godhead exists in terms of their being very dear to the Lord, not identical with Him in all respects. Following in the footsteps of Çréla Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé and Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, later äcäryas like Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura have confirmed the same truths. In his prayers to the spiritual master, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura confirms that all the revealed scriptures accept the spiritual master to be identical with the Personality of Godhead because he is a very dear and confidential servant of the Lord. Gauòéya Vaiñëavas therefore worship Çréla Gurudeva (the spiritual master) in the light of his being the servitor of the Personality of Godhead. In all the ancient literatures of devotional service and in the more recent songs of Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura, Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura and other unalloyed Vaiñëavas, the spiritual master is always considered to be either one of the confidential associates of Çrématé Rädhäräëé or a manifested representation of Çréla Nityänanda Prabhu.\""
