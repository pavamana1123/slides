Thus purified, one never engages in sinful activities, which immediately extinguish the fire of spiritual enlightenment; nor does one become foolish and small-minded, trying to exploit material nature for personal sense gratification. A purified human being is apåthag-dhé, or without consciousness of duality, because he has been trained to observe the Supreme Personality of Godhead within all things. Such sublime consciousness should be systematically taught throughout the world so that human society will become peaceful and sublime."
