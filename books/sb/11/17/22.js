            "content": "The term dvija, or \"twice-born,\" here indicates the three superior classes, namely brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas, who all receive the Gäyatré mantra, which signifies their second birth through spiritual initiation. One's first birth is biological, or seminal, and does not necessarily indicate that one is intelligent or enlightened. A young brähmaëa boy, if qualified, may be initiated with Gäyatré mantra at the age of twelve, and kñatriyas and vaiçyas a few years later. In order to become enlightened with spiritual knowledge, the boy resides within the guru-kula, or äçrama of the spiritual master. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness has established similar guru-kulas all over the world and is issuing a great call to civilized human beings to arrange for the proper education of their children. Every young boy and girl should learn to be self-controlled and should become enlightened through study of authorized Vedic literatures. In this way, unlike ordinary animals, insects, fish and birds, etc., an enlightened human being may take birth twice and thus become perfect in the knowledge that leads to ultimate liberation. The word änupürvyät in this verse indicates the system of saàskäras, or purificatory rites, beginning with garbhädhäna-saàskära, or the purification of the sexual act. Generally, çüdras and those who do not follow the Vedic system are not attracted to such purificatory ceremonies; therefore they remain ignorant of spiritual life and envious of the bona fide spiritual master. Those whose character has been civilized by a systematic cleansing process give up the tendency to be argumentative and whimsical and instead become submissive and eager to learn in the presence of a bona fide spiritual master."
