One who remains perpetually celibate is situated within the heart of Lord Kåñëa, but those brahmacärés who eventually marry are situated within the loins of the universal form of the Lord. The word vane-väsaù refers to vänaprastha, or the retired order of life, which is situated on the chest of the Lord."
