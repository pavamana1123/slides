            "content": "Lord Kåñëa has already elaborately explained the process of jïäna-yoga, bhakti-yoga and añöäìga-yoga. Now Uddhava inquires how those inclined toward karma-yoga can achieve the perfection of life, Kåñëa consciousness. In Bhagavad-gétä  Lord Kåñëa describes that He is personally the creator of the varëäçrama system. Cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù. Therefore the ultimate goal of the varëäçrama system is to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, one should become a devotee of the Lord and learn the process of pure devotional service. The easiest method of achieving pure devotional service is by the association of pure devotees of the Lord. If one submissively and faithfully associates with pure devotees, one can immediately achieve the perfection of life. A Kåñëa conscious person is not required to execute all the formalities of the varëäçrama system, because a Kåñëa conscious person, absorbed in love of Godhead, automatically gives up all sense gratification and mental speculation. Those human beings who do not follow the varëäçrama system are here referred to as dvi-padäm, or two-legged. In other words, one who does not follow the religious path of life is known to be human only by the possession of two legs. Even ordinary animals and insects are eagerly engaged in eating, sleeping, mating and defending; the human being, however, is distinguished from such lower forms of life by his capacity to become religious and, ultimately, to love God in pure Kåñëa consciousness."
