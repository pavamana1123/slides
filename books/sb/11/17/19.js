Although the çüdras are to be satisfied with whatever income they obtain through their service, they never lack the necessities of life, because the other orders of society, such as kñatriyas and vaiçyas, are required to be abundantly generous, and the brähmaëas are well known for being the most merciful of all. Therefore, if all social classes obey the Vedic injunctions there will be a new and blissful life for the entire human society under the guidance of Kåñëa consciousness."
