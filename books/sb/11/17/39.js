            "content": "The purport of this verse is that one's first wife must always be sadåçém, or similar to oneself. In other words, an intellectual man should marry an intellectual wife, a heroic man should marry a heroic wife, a business minded man should marry a woman who can encourage him in such activities, and a çüdra should marry a less intelligent woman. The wife must be beyond reproach in terms of her background and character and should always be younger than oneself, ideally five to ten years younger. If one desires to marry a second wife, then, as stated in this verse by the word varëänupürvyeëa and in the verse spoken by Lord Kåñëa by the word anukramät, one must wait until the first marriage is established and then select a second wife from the next-lower caste. If one marries a third time the wife must be, again, from the next-lower caste. For example, a brähmaëa's first wife will be a brähmaëé, his second wife will be from the kñatriya community, his third wife from the vaiçya community and fourth wife from the çüdra community. A kñatriya may first marry a kñatriya lady and then vaiçya and çüdra ladies. A vaiçya can accept wives from two classes, and a çüdra will accept a wife only from the çüdra class. By this progression of marriages there will be relative peace in the family. These Vedic marriage injunctions, as mentioned in the previous verse, are especially for those who are not pure devotees of the Lord."
