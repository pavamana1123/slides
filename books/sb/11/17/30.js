The word evaà-våttaù indicates that although one may eventually marry and become prominent in society as an intellectual, politician or businessman, during student life one must remain without false prestige as a humble servant of the bona fide spiritual master. The naiñöhiki-brahmacäré, who never marries, is described in the following verse."
