Although many great personalities are sometimes called Bhagavän, ultimately Bhagavän is the one supreme entity who possesses unlimited opulences. Throughout history, many important personalities have been addressed as \"lord,\" but ultimately there is only one Supreme Lord. In the Lord's catur-vyüha, or quadruple expansion, the first manifestation is Väsudeva, who here represents all of the Lord's expansions in the viñëu-tattva category."
