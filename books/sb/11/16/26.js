Certainly fear is one of the great miseries of material life; therefore the gift of fearlessness is very valuable and represents Lord Kåñëa. Both in ordinary pleasant speech and silence, very few confidential things are revealed, and thus diplomacy and silence are both aids to secrecy. Lord Brahmä is prominent among sexual pairs because the original beautiful couple, Sväyambhuva Manu and Çatarüpä, emerged from Lord Brahmä's body, as explained in Chapter Twelve of the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam."
