The cow is so valuable that even its dung and urine are antiseptic and fit for sacrificial offering. Kuça grass is also used for religious occasions. Mahäräja Parékñit constructed a sitting place from kuça grass during the last week of his life. Among beautiful things the lotus cup formed by lotus petals represents Lord Kåñëa, and among jewels the ruby, which is similar to Lord Kåñëa's own Kaustubha gem, symbolizes the potency of the Lord."
