Uddhava here addresses the Lord as the paramam, or supreme brahma, because in His feature as Bhagavän the Lord is the highest feature of the Absolute Truth and the shelter of unlimited spiritual opulences. Unlike those of ordinary living entities, the Lord's opulences cannot be restricted by time, and thus the Lord is anädy-antam, without beginning or end, and apävåtam, unhindered by any superior or equal potency. The opulence of the material world is also resting within the Lord, who alone can protect, maintain, create and destroy the material world. In this chapter, Çré Uddhava inquires from the Lord about His spiritual and material opulences in order to refine his appreciation of the Lord's position as the Absolute Truth. Even Lord Viñëu, the ultimate creator of the material world, is an expansion of Lord Kåñëa, and thus Çré Uddhava wishes to fully appreciate the unique status of his personal friend."
