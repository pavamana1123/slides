Influenced by the Lord's illusory potency, Uddhava had desired the prosperity and victory of these dynasties. But now, by hearing Lord Kåñëa's instructions, he has again fixed his mind exclusively upon Lord Kåñëa, and thus he regards his so-called family members without any mundane conception—as eternal servants of the Lord."
