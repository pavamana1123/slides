            "content": "Çré Uddhava emphasizes here that one can achieve spiritual perfection simply by taking shelter of the Personality of Godhead. Those who do so are called haàsäù, the most discriminating human beings, since they are able to locate the actual source of spiritual happiness, the Lord's lotus feet. The word yoga-karmabhiù indicates that those who are attracted to or proud of achievements in the field of mystic yoga or ordinary material endeavor cannot appreciate the great advantage of obediently surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally the yogés and fruitive workers are proud of their so-called achievements and are more attracted to their own endeavor than to the Lord Himself. By humbly taking shelter of Lord Kåñëa, one can advance easily and quickly on the path of Kåñëa consciousness and go back home, back to Godhead."
