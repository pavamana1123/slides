    "translation": "Who, then, could dare reject You, the very Soul, the most dear object of worship, and the Supreme Lord of all—You who give all possible perfections to the devotees who take shelter of You? Who could be so ungrateful, knowing the benefits You bestow? Who would reject You and accept something for the sake of material enjoyment, which simply leads to forgetfulness of You? And what lack is there for us who are engaged in the service of the dust of Your lotus feet?",

This is the highest stage of yoga, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä."
