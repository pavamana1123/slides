Uddhava's lamentation arose because he thought himself separated from Lord Kåñëa. Actually, Çré Uddhava is an eternally liberated soul, but the Lord placed him in bewilderment and lamentation so that this supreme knowledge of the Uddhava-géta could be spoken. Lord Kåñëa's question here indicates that if Uddhava had not perfectly understood this knowledge, Lord Kåñëa would have explained the same thing again. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, since Çré Uddhava is the intimate friend of Lord Kåñëa, the Lord's question here was in a friendly, playful spirit. The Lord was well aware of Uddhava's complete enlightenment in Kåñëa consciousness."
