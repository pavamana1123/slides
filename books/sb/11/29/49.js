In other words, Lord Çré Kåñëa establishes Himself as the goal of Vedic knowledge without destroying preliminary, inferior processes that may be applicable to grossly materialistic men. Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé thus concludes by offering his obeisances to the spiritual master of the entire universe, Lord Çré Kåñëa."
