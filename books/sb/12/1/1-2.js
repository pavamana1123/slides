In the Ninth Canto of this work, Çukadeva Gosvämé describes how the great rulers of men descended from two royal dynasties, that of the sun and that of the moon. The Ninth Canto's description of Lord Rämacandra, a most famous incarnation of God, occurs in this genealogical narration, and at the end of the Ninth Canto Çukadeva describes the forefathers of Lord Kåñëa and Lord Balaräma. Finally, the appearance of Lord Kåñëa and that of Lord Balaräma are mentioned within the context of the narration of the moon dynasty."

            "content": "The Tenth Canto is devoted exclusively to a description of Lord Kåñëa's childhood pastimes in Våndävana, His teenage activities in Mathurä and His adult activities in Dvärakä. The famous epic Mahäbhärata also describes the events of this period, focusing upon the five Päëòava brothers and their activities in relation with Lord Kåñëa and other leading historical figures, such as Bhéñma, Dhåtaräñöra, Droëäcärya and Vidura. Within the Mahäbhärata is Bhagavad-gétä, in which Lord Kåñëa is declared to be the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çrémad-Bhägavatam, of which we are presently translating the twelfth and final canto, is considered a more advanced literature than the Mahäbhärata because throughout the entire work Lord Çré Kåñëa, the Absolute Truth and supreme source of all existence, is directly, centrally and irrefutably revealed. In fact, the First Canto of the Bhägavatam describes how Çré Vyäsadeva composed this great work because he was dissatisfied with his rather sporadic glorification of Lord Kåñëa in the Mahäbhärata."

            "content": "Although Çrémad-Bhägavatam narrates the histories of many royal dynasties and the lives of innumerable kings, not until the description of the present age, the age of Kali, do we find a minister assassinating his own king and installing his son on the throne. This incident resembles Dhåtaräñöra's attempt to assassinate the Päëòavas and crown his son Duryodhana king. As the Mahäbhärata describes, Lord Kåñëa thwarted this attempt, but with the departure of the Lord for the spiritual sky, the age of Kali became fully manifested, ushering in political assassination within one's own house as a standard technique."
