O best of the Kurus, these ten kings of the Çiçunäga dynasty will rule the earth for a total of 360 years during the age of Kali. My dear Parékñit, King Mahänandi will father a very powerful son in the womb of a çüdra woman. He will be known as Nanda and will be the master of millions of soldiers and fabulous wealth. He will wreak havoc among the kñatriyas, and from that time onward virtually all kings will be irreligious çüdras.",

There is a Supreme Godhead, and there are saintly, powerful men who have taken the role of government leaders and represented that Godhead on earth. With the advent of the age of Kali, however, this transcendental system of government collapsed, and unauthorized, uncivilized men gradually took the reins of power."
