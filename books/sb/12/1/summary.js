Then he gives a description of the numerous faults of the age, after which the presiding goddess of the earth sarcastically berates the foolish members of the kingly order who perpetually try to conquer her. Next Çukadeva Gosvämé explains the four varieties of material annihilation, and then he gives his final advice to Mahäräja Parékñit. Thereafter King Parékñit is bitten by the snake-bird Takñaka and leaves this world. Süta Gosvämé concludes his narration of Çrémad-Bhägavatam to the sages at Naimiñäraëya forest by enumerating the teachers of the various branches of the Vedas and Puräëas, relating the pious history of Märkaëòeya Åñi, glorifying the Supreme Lord in His universal form and in His expansion as the sun-god, summarizing the topics discussed in this literature, and offering final benedictions and prayers."

            "content": "The first chapter of this canto briefly describes the future kings of the dynasty of Magadha and how they become degraded because of the influence of the age of Kali. There were twenty kings who ruled in the family of Püru, in the dynasty of the sun-god, counting from Uparicara Vasu to Puraïjaya. After Puraïjaya, the lineage of this dynasty will become corrupted. Following Puraïjaya there will be five kings known as the Pradyotanas, who are then followed by the Çiçunägas, the Mauryas, the Çuìgas, the Käëvas, thirty kings of the Andhra nation, seven Äbhéras, ten Gardabhés, sixteen Kaìkas, eight Yavanas, fourteen Turuñkas, ten Guruëòas, eleven Maulas, five Kilakilä monarchs and thirteen Bählikas. After this, different regions will be ruled over at the same time by seven Andhra kings, seven Kauçalas, the kings of Vidüra, and the Niñadhas. Then the power of rulership in the countries of Magadha and so forth will fall to kings who are no better than çüdras and mlecchas and are totally absorbed in irreligion."
