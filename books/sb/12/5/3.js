    "translation": "You will not take birth again in the form of your sons and grandsons, like a sprout taking birth from a seed and then generating a new seed. Rather, you are entirely distinct from the material body and its paraphernalia, in the same way that fire is distinct from its fuel.",

As stated in the çruti-mantra, pitä putreëa pitåmän yoni-yonau: \"A father has a father in his son, because he may take birth as his own grandson.\" The purpose of Çrémad-Bhägavatam is spiritual liberation and not the foolish prolonging of the illusion of bodily identification. That is clearly stated in this verse."
