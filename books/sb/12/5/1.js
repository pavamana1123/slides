The essence of the great äcärya's statement is that unconditional loving surrender to the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, as described by Çukadeva Gosvämé, is the highest perfection of life. The exclusive purpose of Çrémad-Bhägavatam is to convince the conditioned soul to execute such surrender to the Lord and go back home, back to Godhead."
