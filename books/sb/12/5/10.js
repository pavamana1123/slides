For the soul, material illusion is just like death, but Parékñit Mahäräja had already destroyed all those dangers that threaten one's spiritual life, such as lust, envy and fear. Çukadeva Gosvämé here congratulates the great saintly king, who, as a pure devotee of Lord Kåñëa homeward bound to the spiritual sky, was far beyond the reach of death."
