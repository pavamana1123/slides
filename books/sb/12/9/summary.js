The Supreme Lord Çré Hari, present before Märkaëòeya in the form of Nara-Näräyaëa, replied, \"So be it,\" and then left for Badarikäçrama. One day, as Çré Märkaëòeya was offering his evening prayers, the water of devastation suddenly flooded the three worlds. With great difficulty Märkaëòeya moved about all alone in this water for a long time, until he came upon a banyan tree. Lying upon a leaf of that tree was an infant boy glowing with a charming effulgence. As Märkaëòeya moved toward the leaf, he was pulled by the boy's inhalation and, just like a mosquito, drawn within His body."

After a moment the sage was carried out by the force of the child's exhalation and hurled back into the ocean of annihilation. Then, seeing that the child on the leaf was actually Çré Hari, the transcendental Lord situated within his own heart, Çré Märkaëòeya tried to embrace Him. But at that moment Lord Hari, the master of all mystic power, disappeared. Then the waters of annihilation disappeared as well, and Çré Märkaëòeya found himself in his own äçrama, just as before."
