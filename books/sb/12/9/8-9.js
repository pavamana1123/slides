    "translation": "Thinking always of his desire to see the Lord's illusory energy, the sage remained in his äçrama, meditating constantly upon the Lord within fire, the sun, the moon, water, the earth, air, lightning and his own heart and worshiping Him with paraphernalia conceived in his mind. But sometimes, overwhelmed by waves of love for the Lord, Märkaëòeya would forget to perform his regular worship.",
