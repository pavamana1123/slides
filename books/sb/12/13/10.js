Also, the first verse of the Bhägavatam states, tene brahma hådä ya ädi-kavaye:  \"Lord Kåñëa expanded perfect knowledge into the heart of Lord Brahmä.\" Because conditioned souls can experience only temporary objects, which are created, maintained and destroyed, they cannot readily understand that Çrémad-Bhägavatam is an eternal, transcendental literature nondifferent from the Absolute Truth."

To his eldest son, Atharvä, He instructed the spiritual science of the self, which is the basis of all other branches of knowledge.\" Despite his exalted position, however, Brahmä still fears the influence of the Lord's illusory potency. Thus this energy seems virtually insurmountable. But Lord Caitanya is so kind that during His missionary activities in eastern and southern India, He freely distributed Kåñëa consciousness to everyone, urging them to become teachers of Bhagavad-gétä. Lord Caitanya, who is Kåñëa Himself, encouraged the people by saying, \"By My order just become a teacher of Lord Kåñëa's message and save this country. I assure you that the waves of mäyä will never stop your progress.\" "
