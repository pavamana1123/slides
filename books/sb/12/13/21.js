Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura clarifies that just as Arjuna was placed into material confusion so that Bhagavad-gétä might be spoken, so King Parékñit, a pure, liberated devotee of the Lord, was cursed to die so that Çrémad-Bhägavatam might be spoken. Actually, King Parékñit is viñëu-räta, eternally under the protection of the Lord. Çukadeva Gosvämé liberated the king from his so-called illusion to exhibit the merciful nature of a pure devotee and the enlightening effect of his association."
