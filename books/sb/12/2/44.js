            "content": "The word räjan, \"O King,\" is significant in this verse. Parékñit Mahäräja was preparing to give up his body and go back home, back to Godhead, and Çukadeva Gosvämé, his most merciful spiritual master, devastated any possible attachment that he might have to the position of king by showing the ultimate insignificance of such a position. By the causeless mercy of the spiritual master one is prepared to go back home, back to Godhead. The spiritual master teaches one to relax one's strong grip on material illusion and leave the kingdom of mäyä behind. Although Çukadeva Gosvämé speaks very bluntly within this chapter about the so-called glory of the material world, he is exhibiting the causeless mercy of the spiritual master, who takes his surrendered disciple back to the kingdom of Godhead, Vaikuëöha."
