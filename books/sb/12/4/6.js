By attentively hearing the story of universal destruction, one can easily understand one's personal departure from this temporary world to be an insignificant incident within the gigantic scope of the total material manifestation. By his deep and relevant discussions of the creation of God, Çukadeva Gosvämé, as an ideal spiritual master, is preparing his disciple for the moment of death."
