It seemed to Çaunaka that Märkaëòeya had lived through two days of Brahmä, and he asked Çré Süta Gosvämé to explain this."

He then worshiped the Supreme Lord Hari for six lifetimes of Manu. In the seventh manvantara, Lord Indra sent Kämadeva (Cupid) and his associates to interrupt the sage's austerities. But Märkaëòeya Åñi defeated them by the potency generated from his penance."

Çré Märkaëòeya prostrated himself in obeisance and then worshiped the Lords by offering Them comfortable seats, water for washing Their feet, and other respectful presentations. He then prayed, \"O Almighty Lord, You bring to life the vital air of all creatures, and You also protect the three worlds, vanquish distress and award liberation. You never allow those who have taken shelter of You to be defeated by any kind of misery. Attaining Your lotus feet is the only auspicious goal for the conditioned souls, and service to You fulfills all their desires. Your pastimes, enacted in the mode of pure goodness, can award everyone salvation from material life. Therefore those who are intelligent worship Your personal form of pure goodness named Çré Näräyaëa, along with Nara, who represents Your unalloyed devotee."

Even great thinkers like Brahmä are simply bewildered when they try to understand Your identity by struggling on the path of säìkhya-yoga. You Yourself manifest the proponents of Säìkhya and other philosophies, and thus Your true personal identity remains hidden beneath the designative covering of the jéva soul. I offer my homage to You, the Mahäpuruña.\""
