    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: O mighty Parékñit, I have related to you the narrations of all these great kings, who spread their fame throughout the world and then departed. My real purpose was to teach transcendental knowledge and renunciation. Stories of kings lend power and opulence to these narrations but do not in themselves constitute the ultimate aspect of knowledge.",

In relation with Kåñëa, all ordinary topics become transcendental narrations, with the power to bring the reader to the perfection of life."
