In this way I will gradually conquer the entire earth.' Because the hearts of these leaders are bound by great expectations, they fail to see death waiting nearby.",

Then they lead their great nations in a struggle to control the sea, land, air and space. Although the politicians and their followers will soon be dead—since birth and death are all inevitable in this world—they persist in their frenetic struggle for ephemeral glory."
