At the request of Parvaté, Lord Çiva presented himself before the sage to grant him the result of his austerities. Coming out of his trance, Çré Märkaëòeya saw Lord Çiva, the spiritual master of the three worlds, together with Parvaté, and he worshiped them by offering them obeisances, words of greeting and a sitting place."

Märkaëòeya begged for unflinching devotion to the Supreme Lord Çré Hari, to the devotees of the Supreme Lord and to Lord Çiva himself. Satisfied with Märkaëòeya's devotion, Lord Çiva awarded him the boons of renown, freedom from old age and death until the time of universal dissolution, knowledge of all three phases of time, renunciation, realized knowledge and the position of a teacher of the Puräëas."
