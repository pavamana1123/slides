His ignorance had been dispelled, and by the mercy of Çré Çukadeva he had gained sight of the supremely auspicious personal form of God, namely the Personality of Godhead, Çré Hari. As a result, he had cast aside all fear of death. Çré Parékñit Mahäräja then begged Çukadeva Gosvämé to permit him to fix his heart upon the lotus feet of Lord Hari and give up his life. Granting this permission, Çré Çukadeva rose and departed. Subsequently Mahäräja Parékñit, free of all doubts, sat down in yogic posture and merged himself in meditation upon the Supersoul. Then the snake-bird Takñaka, arriving in the disguise of a brähmaëa, bit him, and the body of the saintly king immediately burned to ashes."

            "content": "Janamejaya, the son of Parékñit, became very angry when he received news of his father's death, and he began a sacrificial performance for the purpose of destroying all the snakes. Even though Takñaka received protection from Indra, he nevertheless became attracted by the mantras and was about to fall into the fire. Seeing this, Båhaspati, the son of Aìgirä Åñi, came and advised Mahäräja Janamejaya that Takñaka could not be killed because he had drunk the nectar of the demigods. Furthermore, Aìgirä said that all living entities must enjoy the fruits of their past activities. Therefore the king should give up this sacrifice. Janamejaya was thus convinced by the words of Båhaspati and stopped his sacrifice."

            "content": "Thereafter Süta Gosvämé, in response to questions from Çré Çaunaka, described the divisions of the Vedas. From the heart of the topmost demigod, Brahmä, came the subtle transcendental vibration, and from this subtle sound vibration arose the syllable oà, greatly potent and self-luminous. Using this oàkära, Lord Brahmä created the original Vedas and taught them to his sons, Maréci and others, who were all saintly leaders of the brähmaëa community. This body of Vedic knowledge was handed down through the disciplic succession of spiritual masters until the end of Dväpara-yuga, when Lord Vyäsadeva divided it into four parts and instructed various schools of sages in these four saàhitäs. When the sage Yäjïavalkya was rejected by his spiritual master, he had to give up all the Vedic mantras he had received from him. To obtain new mantras of the Yajur Veda, Yäjïavalkya worshiped the Supreme Lord in the form of the sun-god. Çré Süryadeva subsequently fulfilled his prayer."
