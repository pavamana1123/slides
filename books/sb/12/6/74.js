    "translation": "From these countless hundreds of mantras of the Yajur Veda, the powerful sage compiled fifteen new branches of Vedic literature. These became known as the Väjasaneyi-saàhitä because they were produced from the hairs of the horse's mane, and they were accepted in disciplic succession by the followers of Käëva, Mädhyandina and other åñis.",
