    "translation": "Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto my spiritual master, the son of Vyäsadeva, Çukadeva Gosvämé. It is he who defeats all inauspicious things within this universe. Although in the beginning he was absorbed in the happiness of Brahman realization and was living in a secluded place, giving up all other types of consciousness, he became attracted by the pleasing, most melodious pastimes of Lord Çré Kåñëa. He therefore mercifully spoke this supreme Puräëa, Çrémad-Bhägavatam, which is the bright light of the Absolute Truth and which describes the activities of the Lord.",
