Whatever words glorify the innumerable transcendental qualities of the Personality of Godhead are truthful, auspicious and conducive to piety, whereas all other words are impure. Discussions of topics concerning the Supreme Lord bestow ecstasy, which remains constantly new, but persons who are like crows become absorbed in unessential topics, those unrelated to the Personality of Godhead."

Neither knowledge devoid of devotion for Lord Viñëu nor fruitive work not offered to Him have any real beauty. By constant remembrance of Lord Kåñëa, on the other hand, all one's inauspicious desires are destroyed, one's mind is purified, and one attains devotion for Lord Çré Hari along with knowledge filled with realization and detachment."

By hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the spirit soul is purified and obtains salvation from all sins and all kinds of fear. Through the study of this scripture, one achieves the same result as that achieved by one who studies all the Vedas, and one also achieves the fulfillment of all desires. By studying with a controlled mind this essential compilation of all the Puräëas, one will reach the supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead. Every verse of this scripture. Çrémad-Bhägavatam, contains the narrations of Lord Çré Hari, who has innumerable personal forms."
