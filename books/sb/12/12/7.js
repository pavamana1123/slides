    "translation": "The Bhägavatam explains how one can attain liberation at the time of death by practicing fixed meditation in yoga. It also contains a discussion between Närada and Brahmä, an enumeration of the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and a description of how the universe was created in progressive sequence, beginning from the unmanifest stage of material nature.",

Therefore it is understood that Süta Gosvämé is merely summarizing the topics. We should not consider the topics he fails to mention here less important or superfluous, since every letter and word of Çrémad-Bhägavatam is absolute, Kåñëa conscious sound vibration."
