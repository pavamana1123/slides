On the one hand they worship the Lord in His viçva-rüpa, or all-pervading universal form, and on the other they think of the Lord's unmanifested, indescribable, subtle form. The theories of pantheism and monism are respectively applicable to these two conceptions of the Supreme as gross and subtle, but both of them are rejected by the learned pure devotees of the Lord because they are aware of the factual position. This is very clearly mentioned in the Eleventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä, which records Arjuna's experience of the viçva-rüpa of the Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa."

            "content": "Arjuna, as a pure devotee of the Lord, never previously saw the contemplated universal form of the Lord (viçva-rüpa), but when he did see it, his curiosities were satisfied. But he was not happy to see such a form of the Lord because of his attachment as a pure devotee. He was afraid to see the gigantic form of the Lord. He therefore prayed to the Lord to assume His four-handed Näräyaëa or Kåñëa form, which alone could please Arjuna. Undoubtedly the Lord has the supreme potency to exhibit Himself in multifarious forms, but the pure devotees of the Lord are interested in His forms as eternally exhibited in the abode of the Lord, known as the tripäd-vibhüti or kingdom of God. The Lord in the tripäd-vibhüti abode exhibits Himself in two forms, either with four hands or with two hands. The viçva-rüpa exhibited in the material manifestation has unlimited hands and unlimited dimensions with everything unlimited. The pure devotees of the Lord worship Him in His Vaikuëöha forms as Näräyaëa or Kåñëa. Sometimes the same Vaikuëöha forms of the Lord are in the material world also by His grace as Çré Räma, Çré Kåñëa, Çré Narasiàhadeva, etc., and thus the pure devotees also worship them. Usually the features shown in the material world have no existence in the Vaikuëöha planets, and thus they are not accepted by the pure devotees. What the pure devotees worship from the very beginning are eternal forms of the Lord existing in the Vaikuëöha planets. The nondevotee impersonalists imagine the material forms of the Lord, and ultimately they merge in the impersonal brahmajyoti of the Lord, whereas the pure devotees of the Lord are worshipers of the Lord both in the beginning and also in the perfect stage of salvation, eternally. The worship of the pure devotee never stops, whereas the worship of the impersonalist stops after his attainment of salvation, when he merges in the impersonal form of the Lord known as the brahmajyoti. Therefore the pure devotees of the Lord are described here as vipaçcita, or the learned who are in the knowledge of the Lord perfectly."
