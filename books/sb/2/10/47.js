            "content": "The present duration of a kalpa of Brahmä is called the Varäha-kalpa or Çvetavaräha-kalpa because the incarnation of the Lord as Varäha took place during the creation of Brahmä, who was born on the lotus coming out of the abdomen of Viñëu. Therefore this Varäha-kalpa is also called Pädma-kalpa, and this is testified by äcäryas like Jéva Gosvämé as well as Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura in pursuance of the first commentator, Svämé Çrédhara. So there is no contradiction between the Varäha and the Pädma-kalpa of Brahmä."
