    "translation": "All three of the above-mentioned stages of different living entities are interdependent. In the absence of one, another is not understood. But the Supreme Being who sees every one of them as the shelter of the shelter is independent of all, and therefore He is the supreme shelter.",

            "content": "There are innumerable living entities, one dependent on the other in the relationship of the controlled and the controller. But without the medium of perception, no one can know or understand who is the controlled and who is the controller. For example, the sun controls the power of our vision, we can see the sun because the sun has its body, and the sunlight is useful only because we have eyes. Without our having eyes, the sunlight is useless, and without sunlight the eyes are useless. Thus they are interdependent, and none of them is independent. Therefore the natural question arises concerning who made them interdependent. The one who has made such a relationship of interdependence must be ultimately completely independent. As stated in the beginning of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the ultimate source of all interdependent objectives is the complete independent subject. This ultimate source of all interdependence is the Supreme Truth or Paramätmä, the Supersoul, who is not dependent on anything else. He is sväçrayäçrayaù. He is only dependent on His self, and thus He is the supreme shelter of everything. Although Paramätmä and Brahman are subordinate to Bhagavän, because Bhagavän is Puruñottama or the Superperson, He is the source of the Supersoul also. In the Bhagavad-gétä  Lord Kåñëa says that He is the Puruñottama and the source of everything, and thus it is concluded that Çré Kåñëa is the ultimate source and shelter of all entities, including the Supersoul and Supreme Brahman. Even accepting that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul, the individual soul is dependent on the Supersoul for being liberated from the illusion of material energy. The individual is under the clutches of illusory energy, and therefore although qualitatively one with the Supersoul, he is under the illusion of identifying himself with matter. And to get out of this illusory conception of factual life, the individual soul has to depend on the Supersoul to be recognized as one with Him. In that sense also the Supersoul is the supreme shelter. And there is no doubt about it."

In the Bhagavad-gétä these separate positions of the jéva-ätmä and the Paramätmä are specifically mentioned. In the Fourth Chapter, Arjuna, the jéva soul, is represented as forgetful of his many, many previous births, but the Lord, the Supersoul, is not forgetful. The Lord even remembers when He taught the Bhagavad-gétä to the sun-god some billions of years before. The Lord can remember such millions and billions of years, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä  as follows:"
