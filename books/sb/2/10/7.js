            "content": "Thus by general conclusion Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate source of all energies, and the word Kåñëa means that. And to explain Kåñëa or the science of Kåñëa, the Çrémad-Bhägavatam has been prepared. In the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam this truth is indicated in the questions and answers by Süta Gosvämé and great sages like Çaunaka, and in the First and Second Chapters of the canto this is explained. In the Third Chapter this subject is more explicit, and in the Fourth Chapter even more explicit. In the Second Canto the Absolute Truth as the Personality of Godhead is further emphasized, and the indication is the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. The summary of Çrémad-Bhägavatam in four verses, as we have already discussed, is succinct. This Supreme Personality of Godhead in the ultimate issue is confirmed by Brahmä in his Brahma-saàhitä as éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù (BS 5.1). So it is concluded in the Third Canto of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The complete subject matter is elaborately explained in the Tenth and Eleventh Cantos of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. In the matter of the changes of the Manus or manvantaras, such as the Sväyambhuva-manvantara and Cäkñuña-manvantara, as they are discussed in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Cantos of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Lord Kåñëa is indicated. In the Eighth Canto the Vaivasvata-manvantara explains the same subject indirectly, and in the Ninth Canto the same purport is there. In the Twelfth Canto the same is further explained, specifically regarding the different incarnations of the Lord. Thus it is concluded by studying the complete Çrémad-Bhägavatam that Lord Çré Kåñëa is the ultimate summum bonum, or the ultimate source of all energy. And according to the grades of worshipers, the indications of the nomenclature may be differently explained as Näräyaëa, Brahmä, Paramätmä, etc."
