In the mahä-kalpa the Lord assumes the first puruña incarnation as Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu with all the potencies of the mahat-tattva and the sixteen principles of creative matter and instruments. The creative instruments are eleven, the ingredients are five, and all of them are products of mahat, or materialistic ego. These creations by the Lord in His feature of Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu are called mahä-kalpa. The creation of Brahmä and dispersion of the material ingredients are called vikalpa, and the creation by Brahmä in each day of his life is called kalpa. Therefore each day of Brahmä is called a kalpa, and there are thirty kalpas in terms of Brahmä's days. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä  as follows:"

This is accepted even by the modern scientist and attested by the astronauts. Similarly, in the region of still higher planetary systems the duration of day and night is still greater than in the heavenly planets. The four yugas are calculated in terms of the heavenly calendars and accordingly are twelve thousand years in terms of the heavenly planets. This is called a divya-yuga, and one thousand divya-yugas make one day of Brahmä. The creation during the day of Brahmä is called kalpa, and the creation of Brahmä is called vikalpa. When vikalpas are made possible by the breathing of Mahä-Viñëu, this is called a mahä-kalpa. There are regular and systematic cycles of these mahä-kalpas, vikalpas and kalpas. In answer to Mahäräja Parékñit's question about them, Çukadeva Gosvämé answered in the Prabhäsa-khaëòa of the Skanda Puräëa. They are as follows:"

Then again there are vikalpas, which are generated by the breathing of Mahä-Viñëu, as stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (yasyaika-niçvasita-kälam athävalambya jévanti loma-vilajä jagadaëòa-näthäù (BS 5.48)). The Brahmäs live only during the breathing period of Mahä-Viñëu. So the exhaling and inhaling of Viñëu are mahä-kalpas, and all these are due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for no one else is the master of all creations."
