            "content": "This gradual process of evolution suggests the explanation of the controlling deities (adhidaiva) because Varuëa is the controlling deity for all relishable juices. Therefore the mouth becomes the resting place for the tongue, which tastes all the different juices, of which the controlling deity is Varuëa. This suggests, therefore, that Varuëa was also generated along with the development of the tongue. The tongue and the palate, being instrumental, are adhibhütam, or forms of matter, but the functioning deity, who is a living entity, is adhidaiva, whereas the person undergoing the function is adhyätma. Thus the three categories are also explained as to their birth after the opening of the mouth of the viräö-puruña. The four principles mentioned in this verse serve to explain the three main principles, namely the adhyätma, adhidaiva and adhibhutam, as explained before."
