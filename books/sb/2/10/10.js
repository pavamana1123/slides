The Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa and all His plenary portions and extensions of plenary portions are nondifferent from one another, and thus the supreme independence is in each and every one of them. In order to prove this, Çukadeva Gosvämé (as promised to King Parékñit) describes herein the independence of the puruña-avatära Personality of Godhead, even in the sphere of the material creation. Such activities of the Lord are also transcendental, and therefore they are also lélä, or pastimes, of the absolute Lord. Such pastimes of the Lord are very conducive to the hearers for self-realization in the field of devotional service. Some may argue, why not then relish the transcendental lélä of the Lord as exhibited in the land of Mathurä and Våndävana, which are sweeter than anything in the world? Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura replies that the pastimes of the Lord in Våndävana are meant to be relished by advanced devotees of the Lord. Neophyte devotees will misunderstand such supreme transcendental activities of the Lord, and therefore the Lord's pastimes in the material sphere related to creation, maintenance and destruction are verily relishable by the präkåta, or mundane devotees of the Lord. As the yoga system mainly based on bodily exercises is meant for the person who is too much attached to the bodily conception of existence, similarly the Lord's pastimes related to the creation and destruction of the material world are for those who are too materially attached. For such mundane creatures the functions of the body and the functions of the cosmic world through physical laws in relationship with the Lord are also therefore included in understanding of the lawmaker, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The scientists explain the material functions by so many technological terms of material law, but such blind scientists forget the lawmaker. The Çrémad-Bhägavatam points out the lawmaker. One should not be amazed by the mechanical arrangement of the complicated engine or dynamo, but one should praise the engineer who creates such a wonderful working machine. That is the difference between the devotee and the nondevotee. Devotees are always full with praising the Lord, who directs the physical laws. In the Bhagavad-gétä  the direction of the Lord upon the material nature is described as follows:"

The Lord is, however, visible to the naked eyes of people in general when He descends Himself by His own personal potency. Lord Kåñëa incarnated Himself as He is and played very wonderful parts as the Lord Himself, and the Bhagavad-gétä concerns such wonderful actions and knowledge. Yet foolish men will not accept Lord Kåñëa as the Supreme Lord. Generally they consider the infinitesimal and infinite features of the Lord because they themselves are unable to become either the infinitesimal or the infinite, but one should know that the infinite and infinitesimal sizes of the Lord are not His highest glories. The most wonderful manifestation of the Lord's power is exhibited when the infinite Lord becomes visible to our eyes as one of us. Yet His activities are different from those of the finite beings. Lifting a mountain at the age of seven years and marrying sixteen thousand wives in the prime of His youth are some of the examples of His infinite energy, but the müòhas, after seeing them or hearing about them, decry them as legendary and take the Lord as one of them. They cannot understand that the Lord Çré Kåñëa, although in the form of a human being by His own potency, is still the Supreme Lord with full potency as the supreme controller."

And for this reason only, either in the Bhagavad-gétä or in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the pastimes of the Lord in the material world are delineated for the benefit of those men with a poor fund of knowledge."
