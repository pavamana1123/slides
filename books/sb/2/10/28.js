This navel is the joint from one body to the other. Lord Brahmä was born of the abdominal hole of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu as a separate body, and the same principle is followed even in the birth of any ordinary body. The body of the child develops from the body of the mother, and when the child is separated from the body of the mother, it is separated by cutting the navel joint. And that is the way the Supreme Lord manifested Himself as separated many. The living entities are therefore separated parts, and thus they have no independence."
