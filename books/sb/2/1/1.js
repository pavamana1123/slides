            "content": "Even the very question is so nice that it is the best subject matter for hearing. Simply by such questioning and hearing, one can achieve the highest perfectional stage of life. Because Lord Kåñëa is the original Supreme Person, any question about Him is original and perfect. Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu said that the highest perfection of life is to achieve the transcendental loving service of Kåñëa. Because questions and answers about Kåñëa elevate one to that transcendental position, the questions of Mahäräja Parékñit about Kåñëa philosophy are greatly glorified. Mahäräja Parékñit wanted to absorb his mind completely in Kåñëa, and such absorption can be effected simply by hearing about the uncommon activities of Kåñëa. For instance, in the Bhagavad-gétä it is stated that simply by understanding the transcendental nature of Lord Kåñëa's appearance, disappearance, and activities, one can immediately return home, back to Godhead, and never come back to this miserable condition of material existence. It is very auspicious, therefore, to hear always about Kåñëa. So Mahäräja Parékñit requested Çukadeva Gosvämé to narrate the activities of Kåñëa so that he could engage his mind in Kåñëa. The activities of Kåñëa are nondifferent from Kåñëa Himself. As long as one is engaged in hearing such transcendental activities of Kåñëa, he remains aloof from the conditional life of material existence. The topics of Lord Kåñëa are so auspicious that they purify the speaker, the hearer and the inquirer. They are compared to the Ganges waters, which flow from the toe of Lord Kåñëa. Wherever the Ganges waters go, they purify the land and the person who bathes in them. Similarly, kåñëa-kathä, or the topics of Kåñëa, are so pure that wherever they are spoken, the place, the hearer, the inquirer, the speaker and all concerned become purified."
