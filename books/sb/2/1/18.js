    "translation": "Gradually, as the mind becomes progressively spiritualized, withdraw it from sense activities, and by intelligence the senses will be controlled. The mind too absorbed in material activities can be engaged in the service of the Personality of Godhead and become fixed in full transcendental consciousness.",

            "content": "The first process of spiritualizing the mind by mechanical chanting of the praëava (oàkära) and by control of the breathing system is technically called the mystic or yogic process of präëäyäma, or fully controlling the breathing air. The ultimate state of this präëäyäma system is to be fixed in trance, technically called samädhi. But experience has proven that even the samädhi stage also fails to control the materially absorbed mind. For example, the great mystic Viçvämitra Muni, even in the stage of samadhi, became a victim of the senses and cohabited with Menakä. History has already recorded this. The mind, although ceasing to think of sensual activities at present, remembers past sensual activities from the subconscious status and thus disturbs one from cent percent engagement in self-realization. Therefore, Çukadeva Gosvämé recommends the next step of assured policy, namely to fix one's mind in the service of the Personality of Godhead. Lord Çré Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, also recommends this direct process in the Bhagavad-gétä . Thus, the mind being spiritually cleansed, one should at once engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord by the different devotional activities of hearing, chanting, etc. If performed under proper guidance, that is the surest path of progress, even for the disturbed mind."
