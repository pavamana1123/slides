            "content": "Çrémad-Bhägavatam is recognized Vedic wisdom, and the system of receiving Vedic knowledge is called avaroha-panthä, or the process of receiving transcendental knowledge through bona fide disciplic succession. For advancement of material knowledge there is a need for personal ability and researching aptitude, but in the case of spiritual knowledge, all progress depends more or less on the mercy of the spiritual master. The spiritual master must be satisfied with the disciple; only then is knowledge automatically manifest before the student of spiritual science. The process should not, however, be misunderstood to be something like magical feats whereby the spiritual master acts like a magician and injects spiritual knowledge into his disciple, as if surcharging him with an electrical current. The bona fide spiritual master reasonably explains everything to the disciple on the authorities of Vedic wisdom. The disciple can receive such teachings not exactly intellectually, but by submissive inquiries and a service attitude. The idea is that both the spiritual master and the disciple must be bona fide. In this case, the spiritual master, Çukadeva Gosvämé, is ready to recite exactly what he has learned from his great father Çréla Vyäsadeva, and the disciple, Mahäräja Parékñit, is a great devotee of Lord Kåñëa. A devotee of Lord Kåñëa is he who believes sincerely that by becoming a devotee of the Lord one becomes fully equipped with everything spiritual. This teaching is imparted by the Lord Himself in the pages of the Bhagavad-gétä, in which it is clearly described that the Lord (Çré Kåñëa) is everything, and that to surrender unto Him solely and wholly makes one the most perfectly pious man. This unflinching faith in Lord Kåñëa prepares one to become a student of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and one who hears Çrémad-Bhägavatam from a devotee like Çukadeva Gosvämé is sure to attain salvation at the end, as Mahäräja Parékñit did. The professional reciter of Çrémad-Bhägavatam and the pseudodevotees whose faith is based on one week's hearing are different from Çukadeva Gosvämé and Mahäräja Parékñit. Çréla Vyäsadeva explained Çrémad-Bhägavatam unto Çukadeva Gosvämé from the very beginning of the janmädy asya  in His devotional feature as Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is Lord Kåñëa Himself in His devotional attitude, descended on earth to bestow special favors upon the fallen souls of this age of Kali. There are two verses particularly suitable to offer as prayers to this Mahäpuruña feature of Lord Kåñëa."

            "content": "In other words, puruña means the enjoyer, and mahäpuruña means the supreme enjoyer, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. One who deserves to approach the Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa is called the mahä-pauruñika. Anyone who hears Çrémad-Bhägavatam attentively from its bona fide reciter is sure to become a sincere devotee of the Lord, who is able to award liberation. There was none so attentive as Mahäräja Parékñit in the matter of hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and there was none so qualified as Çukadeva Gosvämé to recite the text of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Therefore, anyone who follows in the footsteps of either the ideal reciter or the ideal hearer, Çukadeva Gosvämé and Mahäräja Parékñit respectively, will undoubtedly attain salvation like them. Mahäräja Parékñit attained salvation by hearing only, and Çukadeva Gosvämé attained salvation only by reciting. Recitation and hearing are two processes out of nine devotional activities, and by strenuously following the principles, either in all or by parts, one can attain the absolute plane. So the complete text of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, beginning with the janmädy asya , was spoken by Çukadeva Gosvämé for the attainment of salvation by Mahäräja Parékñit. In the Padma Puräëa, it is mentioned that Gautama Muni advised Mahäräja Ambaréña to hear regularly Çrémad-Bhägavatam as it was recited by Çukadeva Gosvämé, and herein it is confirmed that Mahäräja Ambaréña heard Çrémad-Bhägavatam from the very beginning to the end, as it was spoken by Çukadeva Gosvämé. One who is actually interested in the Bhägavatam, therefore, must not play with it by reading or hearing a portion from here and a portion from there; one must follow in the footsteps of great kings like Mahäräja Ambaréña or Mahäräja Parékñit and hear it from a bona fide representative of Çukadeva Gosvämé."
