And above the luminary planets, called also the heavenly places of the universal directorate demigods, are the Mahar, Janas and Tapas planetary systems, and, above all, the Satyaloka planetary system, where the chief directors of the modes of material nature reside, namely Viñëu, Brahmä and Çiva. This Viñëu is known as the Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, and He acts as the Supersoul in every living being. There are innumerable universes floating on the Causal Ocean, and in each of them the representation of the viräö form of the Lord is there along with innumerable suns, moons, heavenly demigods, Brahmäs, Viñëus and Çivas, all of them situated in one part of the inconceivable potency of Lord Kåñëa, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä ."
