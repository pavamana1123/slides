Indirectly, the Gosvämé told Mahäräja Parékñit that he should take shelter of the sound representation of the Lord for the seven days still remaining in the duration of his life and thus get himself liberated. In other words, everyone can best prepare himself for the next life simply by hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam, as it was recited by Çukadeva Gosvämé to Mahäräja Parékñit. The rituals are not formal, but there are also some favorable conditions, which are required to be carried out, as instructed hereafter."
