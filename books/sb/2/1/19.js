    "translation": "Thereafter, you should meditate upon the limbs of Viñëu, one after another, without being deviated from the conception of the complete body. Thus the mind becomes free from all sense objects. There should be no other thing to be thought upon. Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, is the Ultimate Truth, the mind becomes completely reconciled in Him only.",

            "content": "Foolish persons, bewildered by the external energy of Viñëu, do not know that the ultimate goal of the progressive search after happiness is to get in touch directly with Lord Viñëu, the Personality of Godhead. Viñëu-tattva is an unlimited expansion of different transcendental forms of the Personality of Godhead, and the supreme or original form of viñëu-tattva is Govinda, or Lord Kåñëa, the supreme cause of all causes. Therefore, thinking of Viñëu or meditating upon the transcendental form of Viñëu, specifically upon Lord Kåñëa, is the last word on the subject of meditation. This meditation may be begun from the lotus feet of the Lord. One should not, however, forget or be misled from the complete form of the Lord; thus one should practice thinking of the different parts of His transcendental body, one after another. Here in this verse, it is definitely assured that the Supreme Lord is not impersonal. He is a person, but His body is different from those of conditioned persons like us. Otherwise, meditation beginning from the praëava (oàkära) up to the limbs of the personal body of Viñëu would not have been recommended by Çukadeva Gosvämé for the attainment of complete spiritual perfection. The Viñëu forms of worship in great temples of India are not, therefore, arrangements of idol worship, as they are wrongly interpreted to be by a class of men with a poor fund of knowledge; rather, they are different spiritual centers of meditation on the transcendental limbs of the body of Viñëu. The worshipable Deity in the temple of Viñëu is identical with Lord Viñëu by the inconceivable potency of the Lord. Therefore, a neophyte's concentration or meditation upon the limbs of Viñëu in the temple, as contemplated in the revealed scriptures, is an easy opportunity for meditation for persons who are unable to sit down tightly at one place and then concentrate upon praëava oàkära or the limbs of the body of Viñëu, as recommended herein by Çukadeva Gosvämé, the great authority. The common man can benefit more by meditating on the form of Viñëu in the temple than on the oàkära, the spiritual combination of a-u-m as explained before. There is no difference between oàkära and the forms of Viñëu, but persons unacquainted with the science of Absolute Truth try to create dissension by differentiating between the forms of Viñëu and that of oàkära. Here it is indicated that the Viñëu form is the ultimate goal of meditation, and as such it is better to concentrate upon the forms of Viñëu than on impersonal oàkära. The latter process is also more difficult than the former."
