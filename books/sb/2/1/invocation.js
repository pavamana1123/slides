            "content": "Väsudeväya means \"to Kåñëa, the son of Vasudeva.\" Since by chanting the name of Kåñëa, Väsudeva, one can achieve all the good results of charity, austerity and penances, it is to be understood that by the chanting of this mantra, oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya, the author or the speaker or any one of the readers of Çrémad-Bhägavatam is offering respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, the reservoir of all pleasure. In the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the principles of creation are described, and thus the First Canto may be called \"Creation.\" In the Second Canto, the post-creation cosmic manifestation is described. The different planetary systems are described in the Second Canto as different parts of the universal body of the Lord. For this reason, the Second Canto may be called \"The Cosmic Manifestation.\" There are ten chapters in the Second Canto, and in these ten chapters the purpose of Çrémad-Bhägavatam and the different symptoms of this purpose are narrated. The first chapter describes the glories of chanting, and it hints at the process by which the neophyte devotees may perform meditation on the universal form of the Lord. In the first verse, Çukadeva Gosvämé replies to the questions of Mahäräja Parékñit, who asked him about one's duties at the point of death. Mahäräja Parékñit was glad to receive Çukadeva Gosvämé, and he was proud of being a descendant of Arjuna, the intimate friend of Kåñëa. Personally, he was very humble and meek, but he expressed his gladness that Lord Kåñëa was very kind to his grandfathers, the sons of Päëòu, especially his own grandfather, Arjuna. And because Lord Kåñëa was always pleased with Mahäräja Parékñit's family, at the verge of Mahäräja Parékñit's death Çukadeva Gosvämé was sent to help him in the process of self-realization. Mahäräja Parékñit was a devotee of Lord Kåñëa from his childhood, so he had natural affection for Kåñëa. Çukadeva Gosvämé could understand his devotion. Therefore, he welcomed the questions about the King's duty. Because the King hinted that worship of Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate function of every living entity, Çukadeva Gosvämé welcomed the suggestion and said, \"Because you have raised questions about Kåñëa, your question is most glorious.\" The translation of the first verse is as follows."
