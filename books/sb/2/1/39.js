One must concentrate the mind on Him, the only all-blissful Absolute Truth. Otherwise one will be misled and will cause his own degradation.",

            "content": "In this verse, the process of devotional service is indicated by the great Gosvämé, Çréla Çukadeva. He tries to impress upon us that instead of diverting our attention to several branches of self-realization, we should concentrate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the supreme object of realization, worship and devotion. Self-realization is, as it were, offering a fight for eternal life against the material struggle for existence, and therefore by the illusory grace of the external energy, the yogé or the devotee is faced with many allurements which can entangle a great fighter again in the bondage of material existence. A yogé can attain miraculous successes in material achievements, such as aëimä and laghimä, by which one can become more minute than the minutest or lighter than the lightest, or in the ordinary sense, one may achieve material benedictions in the shape of wealth and women. But one is warned against such allurements because entanglement again in such illusory pleasure means degradation of the self and further imprisonment in the material world. By this warning, one should follow one's vigilant intelligence only."

            "content": "The Supreme Lord is one, and His expansions are various. He is therefore the Supersoul of everything. When a man sees anything, he must know that his seeing is secondary and the Lord's seeing is primary. One cannot see anything without the Lord's having first seen it. That is the instruction of the Vedas and the Upaniñads. So whatever we see or do, the Supersoul of all acts of seeing or doing is the Lord. This theory of simultaneous oneness and difference between the individual soul and the Supersoul is propounded by Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu as the philosophy of acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva. The viräö-rüpa, or the gigantic feature of the Supreme Lord, includes everything materially manifested, and therefore the viräö or gigantic feature of the Lord is the Supersoul of all living and nonliving entities. But the viräö-rüpa is also the manifestation of Näräyaëa or Viñëu, and going further on and on one will eventually see that Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate Supersoul of everything that be. The conclusion is that one should unhesitatingly become a worshiper of Lord Kåñëa, or, for that matter, His plenary expansion Näräyaëa, and none else. In the Vedic hymns, it is clearly said that first of all Näräyaëa cast a glance over matter and thus there was creation. Before creation, there was neither Brahmä nor Çiva, and what to speak of others. Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya has definitely accepted this, that Näräyaëa is beyond the material creation and that all others are within the material creation. The whole material creation, therefore, is one with and different from Näräyaëa, simultaneously, and this supports the acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva philosophy of Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Being an emanation from the glancing potency of Näräyaëa, the whole material creation is nondifferent from Him. But because it is the effect of His external energy (bahiraìgä mäyä) and is aloof from the internal potency (ätma-mäyä), the whole material creation is different from Him at the same time. The example given in this verse very nicely is that of the dreaming man. The dreaming man creates many things in his dream, and thus he himself becomes the entangled seer of the dream and is also affected by the consequences. This material creation is also exactly a dreamlike creation of the Lord, but He, being the transcendental Supersoul, is neither entangled nor affected by the reactions of such a dreamlike creation. He is always in His transcendental position, but essentially He is everything, and nothing is apart from Him. As a part of Him, one should therefore concentrate on Him only, without deviation; otherwise one is sure to be overcome by the potencies of the material creation, one after another. It is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä  as follows:"
