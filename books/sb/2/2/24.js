Before reaching there, the mystic passes over the Milky Way to reach Brahmaloka, and while going there he first reaches Vaiçvänara-loka, where the demigod controls fire. On Vaiçvänara-loka the yogé becomes completely cleansed of all dirty sins acquired while in contact with the material world. The Milky Way in the sky is indicated herein as the way leading to Brahmaloka, the highest planet of the universe."
