            "content": "The sufferings of human society are due to a polluted aim of life, namely lording it over the material resources. The more human society engages in the exploitation of undeveloped material resources for sense gratification, the more it will be entrapped by the illusory, material energy of the Lord, and thus the distress of the world will be intensified instead of diminished. The human necessities of life are fully supplied by the Lord in the shape of food grains, milk, fruit, wood, stone, sugar, silk, jewels, cotton, salt, water, vegetables, etc., in sufficient quantity to feed and care for the human race of the world as well as the living beings on each and every planet within the universe. The supply source is complete, and only a little energy by the human being is required to get his necessities into the proper channel. There is no need of machines and tools or huge steel plants for artificially creating comforts of life. Life is never made comfortable by artificial needs, but by plain living and high thinking. The highest perfectional thinking for human society is suggested here by Çukadeva Gosvämé, namely, sufficiently hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam. For men in this age of Kali, when they have lost the perfect vision of life, this Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the torchlight by which to see the real path. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé Prabhupäda has commented on the kathämåtam mentioned in this verse and has indicated Çrémad-Bhägavatam to be the nectarean message of the Personality of Godhead. By sufficient hearing of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the polluted aim of life, namely lording it over matter, will subside, and the people in general in all parts of the world will be able to live a peaceful life of knowledge and bliss."

And by practicing bhakti-yoga, if the performer is not purified from the material contamination, he must be a pseudodevotee. For such an imposter there is no remedy for being freed from material entanglement."
