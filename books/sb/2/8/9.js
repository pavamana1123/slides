    "translation": "Brahmä, who was not born of a material source but of the lotus flower coming out of the navel abdomen of the Lord, is the creator of all those who are materially born. Of course, by the grace of the Lord, Brahmä was able to see the form of the Lord.",

            "content": "The first living creature, Brahmä, is called ajaù because he did not take his birth from the womb of a mother materially born. He was directly born from the bodily expansion of the lotus flower of the Lord. Thus it is not readily understandable whether the body of the Lord and that of Brahmä are of the same quality or different. This must also be clearly understood. One thing is, however, certain: Brahmä was completely dependent on the mercy of the Lord because after his birth he could create living beings by the Lord's grace only, and he could see the form of the Lord. Whether the form seen by Brahmä is of the same quality as that of Brahmä is a bewildering question, and Mahäräja Parékñit wanted to get clear answers from Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé."
