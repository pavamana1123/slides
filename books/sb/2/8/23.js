He enjoys His pastimes by creation as He desires and gives them up to the external energy at the time of annihilation. By His internal potency only, He kills the demon Pütanä, even though enjoying His pastimes in the lap of His mother Yaçodä. And when He desires to leave this world He creates the pastimes of killing His own family members (Yadu-kula) and remains unaffected by such annihilation. He is the witness of everything that is happening, and yet He has nothing to do with anything. He is independent in every respect. Mahäräja Parékñit desired to know more perfectly, for a pure devotee ought to know well."
