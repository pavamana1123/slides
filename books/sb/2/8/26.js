The disciplic successions from other sages are simply a waste of time, being devoid of acyuta-kathä, or the message of the infallible Lord. The mental speculators can present their theories very nicely by reason and arguments, but such reasons and arguments are not infallible, for they are defeated by better mental speculators. Mahäräja Parékñit was not interested in the dry speculation of the flickering mind, but he was interested in the topics of the Lord because factually he felt that by hearing such a nectarean message from the mouth of Çukadeva Gosvämé he was not feeling any exhaustion, even though he was fasting because of his imminent death."

One will be exhausted very soon from hearing such hackneyed ways of thinking, and no one in the world can be satisfied simply by hearing such useless speculations. The message of the Lord, especially from a personality like Çukadeva Gosvämé, can never be tiring, even though one may be exhausted from other causes."

            "content": "In some editions of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the text of the last line of this verse reads anyatra kupitäd dvijät, which means that the King might be overwhelmed by the thought of his imminent death by snakebite. The snake is also twice-born, and its anger is compared to the cursing brähmaëa boy who was without good intelligence. Mahäräja Parékñit was not at all afraid of death, for he was fully encouraged by the message of the Lord. One who is fully absorbed in acyuta-kathä can never be afraid of anything in this world."
