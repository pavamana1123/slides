Such third-grade devotees should know well that material attachment and seeing the Lord face to face cannot go together. It is not such a mechanical process that the professional Bhägavatam reciters can do the job on behalf of the third-grade materialistic pseudo-devotee. The professional men are useless in this connection because they are neither self-realized nor interested in the liberation of the audience. They are simply interested in maintaining the material establishment of family attachment and earning some material benefits out of the profession. Mahäräja Parékñit had no more than seven days to live, but for others Mahäräja Parékñit personally recommends that one hear Çrémad-Bhägavatam regularly, nityam, always by one's own effort and with serious devotion also. That will help one to see the Lord Çré Kåñëa manifested in one's heart within no time."

That is not the way recommended by an authority like Mahäräja Parékñit, who heard and benefited by hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam."
