One who takes it as belonging to a particular sect is certainly mistaken. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is certainly a very dear scripture for all the devotees of the Lord, but it is auspicious even for the nondevotees also because it explains that even the nondevotees hovering under the spell of material energy can be delivered from such clutches if they hear the narration of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam with devotion and attention from the right source representing the Lord by disciplic succession."
