And to constantly associate with the Supreme Lord Kåñëa means to be liberated from the qualities of matter. Lord Kåñëa is like the sun, and material contamination is like darkness. As the presence of the sun dissipates darkness, constant engagement in the association of the Lord Çré Kåñëa frees one from the contamination of the material qualities. Contamination by the material qualities is the cause of repeated birth and death, and liberation from material qualities is transcendence. Mahäräja Parékñit was now a realized soul by this secret of liberation, through the grace of Çukadeva Gosvämé, for the latter had informed the King that the highest perfection of life is to be in remembrance of Näräyaëa at the end of life. Mahäräja Parékñit was destined to give up his body at the end of seven days, and thus he decided to continue remembering the Lord by His association with the topics of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and thus to quit his body in full consciousness of the presence of the Lord Çré Kåñëa, the Supreme Soul."

Mahäräja Parékñit was a soul realized in the Absolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead. The fruitive materialist is not a realized soul; he wants to derive some material benefit from his so-called hearing of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Undoubtedly such an audience, hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam from the professional men, can derive some material benefit as they desire, but that does not mean that such a pretense of hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam for a week is as good as the hearing of Mahäräja Parékñit."
