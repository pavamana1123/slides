    "translation": "He began to reply to the inquiries of Mahäräja Parékñit by saying that the science of the Personality of Godhead was spoken first by the Lord Himself to Brahmä when he was first born. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the supplementary Vedic literature, and it is just in pursuance of the Vedas.",

The impersonalist always tries to misrepresent the personal feature of the Lord, not knowing the science of this great knowledge, and Çrémad-Bhägavatam is in pursuance of the Vedas and scientific knowledge of the Personality of Godhead. To learn this science one should take shelter of the representative of Çré Çukadeva and follow in the footsteps of Mahäräja Parékñit without foolishly attempting to interpret, thereby committing a great offense at the feet of the Lord. The dangerous ways of interpretations by the nondevotee class of men have played havoc in understanding the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and the careful student should be always alert in this matter if he at all wants to learn the science of Godhead."
