As the Bhagavad-gétä was authoritatively discussed between Lord Kåñëa and Arjuna (the Lord and the devotee respectively), similarly Çrémad-Bhägavatam, which is the postgraduate study of the Bhagavad-gétä, can also be discussed between the scholars and devotees like Çukadeva Gosvämé and Mahäräja Parékñit. Otherwise the real taste of the nectar cannot be relished. Çukadeva Gosvämé was pleased with Mahäräja Parékñit because he was not at all tired of hearing the topics of the Lord and was more and more anxious to hear them on and on with interest. Foolish interpreters unnecessarily tackle the Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam when they have no access to the subject matter. There is no use in nondevotees' meddling with the two topmost Vedic literatures, and therefore Çaìkaräcärya did not touch Çrémad-Bhägavatam for commentation. In his commentation on the Bhagavad-gétä, Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya accepted Lord Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but later on he commented from the impersonalist's view. But, being conscious of his position, he did not comment on the Çrémad-Bhägavatam."

As devotees of the Lord, they are always protected by the Lord. It is clear also in this connection that a Viñëuräta should hear Çrémad-Bhägavatam from Brahmaräta and no one else because others misrepresent the transcendental knowledge and thus spoil one's valuable time."
