Lord Çiva is the greatest yogé, and he can perform such wonderful things, far beyond the ordinary living beings. The devotees of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, do not directly practice the process of mystic powers, but, by the grace of the Lord, His devotee can defeat even a great yogeçvara like Durväsä Muni, who picked a quarrel with Mahäräja Ambaréña and wanted to show the wonderful achievements of his mystic powers. Mahäräja Ambaréña was a pure devotee of the Lord, and thus without any effort on his part the Lord saved him from the wrath of Yogeçvara Durväsä Muni, and the latter was obliged to beg pardon from the King. Similarly, at the time of Draupadé's precarious position, when she was attacked by the Kurus who wanted to see her naked in the open assembly of the royal order, the Lord saved her from being stripped by supplying an unlimited length of sari to cover her. And Draupadé knew nothing of mystic powers. Therefore the devotees are also yogeçvaras by the unlimited power of the Lord, just as a child is powerful by the strength of the parents. They do not try to protect themselves by any artificial means, but are saved by the mercy of the parents."

He inquired also about their detachment from the subtle and gross material bodies. He inquired also about the purports of the Vedic knowledge. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä , the whole purport of all the Vedas is to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become a transcendental loving servant of the Lord."
