            "content": "The supreme truth has been ascertained in the previous verse as puruña or the puruñottama, the Supreme person. The Absolute person is the éçvara, or the supreme controller, by His different energies. The ekapäd-vibhüti manifestation of the material energy of the Lord is just like one of the many mistresses of the Lord, by whom the Lord is not so much attracted, as indicated in the language of the Gétä (bhinnä prakåtiù). But the region of the tripäd-vibhüti, being a pure spiritual manifestation of the energy of the Lord, is, so to speak, more attractive to Him. The Lord, therefore, generates the material manifestations by impregnating the material energy, and then, within the manifestation, He expands Himself as the gigantic form of the viçva-rüpa. The viçva-rüpa, as it was shown to Arjuna, is not the original form of the Lord. The original form of the Lord is the transcendental form of Puruñottama, or Kåñëa Himself. It is very nicely explained herein that He expands Himself just like the sun. The sun expands itself by its terrible heat and rays, yet the sun is always aloof from such rays and heat. The impersonalist takes into consideration the rays of the Lord without any information of the tangible, transcendental, eternal form of the Lord, known as Kåñëa. Therefore Kåñëa, in His supreme personal form, with two hands and flute, is bewildering for the impersonalists who can accommodate only the gigantic viçva-rüpa of the Lord. They should know that the rays of the sun are secondary to the sun, and similarly the impersonal gigantic form of the Lord is also secondary to the personal form as Puruñottama. The Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38) confirms this statement as follows:"
