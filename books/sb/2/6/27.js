    "translation": "Thus I had to arrange all these necessary ingredients and paraphernalia of sacrifice from the personal bodily parts of the Personality of Godhead. By invocation of the demigods' names, the ultimate goal, Viñëu, was gradually attained, and thus compensation and ultimate offering were complete.",

Näräyaëa, the Supreme Lord, is the goal of sacrificial results, and therefore the Vedic hymns are ultimately meant for attaining this goal. Human life is thus made successful by pleasing Näräyaëa and getting entrance into the direct association of Näräyaëa in the spiritual kingdom of Vaikuëöha."
