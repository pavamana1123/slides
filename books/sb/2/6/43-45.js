They are only a fragment of the transcendental potency of the Lord.",

The less intelligent man is surprised to see the wonderful actions of material phenomena, as the aborigines are fearful of a great thunderbolt, a great and gigantic banyan tree, or a great lofty mountain in the jungle. For such undeveloped human beings, merely the slight display of the Lord's potency is captivating. A still more advanced person is captivated by the powers of the demigods and goddesses. Therefore, those who are simply astonished by the powers of anything in the creation of the Lord, without any factual information of the Lord Himself, are known as çäktas, or worshipers of the great powers. The modern scientist is also captivated by the wonderful actions and reactions of natural phenomena and therefore is also a çäkta. These lower-grade persons gradually rise to become sauréyas (worshipers of the sun-god) or gäëapatyas (worshipers of the mass of people as janatä janärdana or daridra-näräyaëa, etc., in the form of Gaëapati) and then rise to the platform of worshiping Lord Çiva in search for the ever-existing soul, and then to the stage of worshiping Lord Viñëu, the Supersoul, etc., without any information of Govinda, Lord Kåñëa, who is the original Lord Viñëu. In other ways some are worshipers of race, nationality, birds, beasts, evil spirits, satans, etc. The general worship of Çanideva, the lord of distressful condition, and Sétalädevé, the goddess of smallpox, is also common to the mass of people, and there are many foolish men who worship the mass of people or the poor class of men. So different persons, societies and communities, etc., worship some of the potent manifestations of the Lord, wrongly accepting the powerful object as God. But in this verse it is advised by Brahmäjé that none of them is the Supreme Lord; they are only borrowed plumes from the original Almighty Lord Çré Kåñëa. When the Lord advises in Bhagavad-gétä to worship Him alone, it is to be understood that worshiping Lord Kåñëa includes worshiping all that is mentioned, because He, Lord Kåñëa, includes everyone."

But when the Lord actually descends on the earth or anywhere within the universe, the less intelligent class of men also mistake Him to be one of them, and thus they imagine the Transcendence to be formless or impersonal. Factually, the Lord is not formless, nor does He belong to any of the multiforms experienced within the universal forms. One should try to know the truth about the Lord by following the instruction of Brahmäjé."
