            "content": "The conception of one without a second is clearly confirmed here. The one is Lord Väsudeva, and only by His different energies and expansions are different manifestations, both in the material and in the spiritual worlds, maintained. In the material world also, Lord Väsudeva is everything, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä . Mattaù parataraà nänyat: \"There is nothing above Me [Lord Kåñëa].\" So the conception of oneness, as overly stressed by the impersonalist, is also accepted by the personalist devotee of the Lord. The difference is that the impersonalist denies personality in the ultimate issue, whereas the devotee gives more importance to the Personality of Godhead. Çrémad-Bhägavatam explains this truth in the verse under discussion: Lord Väsudeva is one without a second, but because He is all-powerful, He can expand Himself as well as display His omnipotencies. The Lord is described here as omnipotent by three energies (tri-çakti-dhåk). So primarily His three energies are internal, marginal and external. This external energy is also displayed in the three modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Similarly, the internal potency is also displayed in three spiritual modes—saàvit, sandhiné and hlädiné. The marginal potency, or the living entities, is also spiritual (prakåtià viddhi me paräm), but the living entities are never equal to the Lord. The Lord is nirasta-sämya-atiçaya; in other words, no one is greater than or equal to the Supreme Lord. So the living entities, including even such great personalities as Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, are all subordinate to the Lord. In the material world also, in His eternal form of Viñëu, He maintains and controls all the affairs of the demigods, including Brahmä and Çiva."
