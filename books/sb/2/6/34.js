            "content": "Lord Brahmä is the original speaker of Vedic wisdom to Närada, and Närada is the distributor of transcendental knowledge all over the world through his various disciples, like Vyäsadeva and others. The followers of Vedic wisdom accept the statements of Brahmäjé as gospel truth, and transcendental knowledge is thus being distributed all over the world by the process of disciplic succession from time immemorial, since the beginning of the creation. Lord Brahmä is the perfect liberated living being within the material world, and any sincere student of transcendental knowledge must accept the words and statements of Brahmäjé as infallible. The Vedic knowledge is infallible because it comes down directly from the Supreme Lord unto the heart of Brahmä, and since he is the most perfect living being, Brahmäjé is always correct to the letter. And this is because Lord Brahmä is a great devotee of the Lord who has earnestly accepted the lotus feet of the Lord as the supreme truth. In the Brahma-saàhitä, which is compiled by Brahmäjé, he repeats the aphorism govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi: \"I am a worshiper of the original Personality of Godhead, Govinda, the primeval Lord.\" So whatever he says, whatever he thinks, and whatever he does normally in his mood are to be accepted as truth because of his direct and very intimate connection with Govinda, the primeval Lord. Çré Govinda, who pleasingly accepts the loving transcendental service of His devotees, gives all protection to the words and actions of His devotees. The Lord declares in the Bhagavad-gétä :"

            "content": "Anyone, therefore, who is earnestly serious in heart and soul about being in intimate touch with the Personality of Godhead in the relationship of transcendental loving service will always be infallible in words and action. The reason is that the Supreme Lord is Absolute Truth, and anything earnestly dovetailed with the Absolute Truth attains the same transcendental quality. On the other hand, any amount of mental speculation on the strength of material science and knowledge without any bona fide touch with the Absolute Truth is sure to be a mundane untruth and failure, simply due to not being in touch with the Absolute Truth. Such godless, unfaithful words and actions, however materially enriched, are never to be trusted. That is the purport of this important verse. A grain of devotion is more valuable than tons of faithlessness."
