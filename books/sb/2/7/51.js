            "content": "The Bhägavatam in a nutshell, spoken by the Personality of Godhead in about half a dozen verses, which will appear ahead, is the science of God, and it is the potent representation of the Personality of Godhead. He, being absolute, is nondifferent from the science of God, Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Brahmäjé received this science of Godhead from the Lord directly, and he handed over the same to Närada, who in his turn ordered Çréla Vyäsadeva to expand it. So the transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Lord is not mental speculation by the mundane wranglers, but is uncontaminated, eternal, perfect knowledge beyond the jurisdiction of material modes. The Bhägavata Puräëa is therefore the direct incarnation of the Lord in the form of transcendental sound, and one should receive this transcendental knowledge from the bona fide representative of the Lord in the chain of disciplic succession from the Lord to Brahmäjé, from Brahmäjé to Närada, from Närada to Vyäsa, from Vyäsadeva to Çukadeva Gosvämé, from Çukadeva Gosvämé to Süta Gosvämé. The ripened fruit of the Vedic tree drops from one hand to another without being broken by falling suddenly from a high branch down to the earth. Therefore unless one hears the science of Godhead from the bona fide representative of the disciplic succession, as above mentioned, for one to understand the theme of the science of Godhead will be a difficult job. It should never be heard from the professional Bhägavatam reciters who earn their livelihood by gratifying the senses of the audience."
