In that way there are 420 Manus in a month of Brahmä and 5,040 Manus in one year of Brahmä. Brahmä lives for one hundred years according to his calculation, and as such there are 504,000 Manus in the jurisdiction of one Brahmä. There are innumerable Brahmäs, and all of them live only during one breathing period of Mahä-Viñëu. So we can just imagine how the incarnations of the Supreme Lord work all over the material worlds, which comprehend only one-fourth of the total energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
