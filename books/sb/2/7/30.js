    "translation": "When the cowherd woman [Kåñëa's foster mother, Yaçodä] was trying to tie the hands of her son with ropes, she found the rope to be always insufficient in length, and when she finally gave up, Lord Kåñëa, by and by, opened His mouth, wherein the mother found all the universes situated. Seeing this, she was doubtful in her mind, but she was convinced in a different manner of the mystic nature of her son.",

            "content": "One day Lord Kåñëa as the naughty child disturbed His mother Yaçodä, and she began to tie up the child with ropes just to punish Him. But no matter how much rope she used, she found it always insufficient. Thus she became fatigued, but in the meantime the Lord opened His mouth, and the affectionate mother saw within the mouth of her son all the universes situated together. The mother was astonished, but out of her deep affection for Kåñëa she thought that the Almighty Godhead Näräyaëa had kindly looked after her son just to protect Him from all the continuous calamities happening to Him. Because of her deep affection for Kåñëa, she could never think that her very son was Näräyaëa, the Personality of Godhead Himself. That is the action of yogamäyä, the internal potency of the Supreme Lord, which acts to perfect all the pastimes of the Lord with His different types of devotees. Who could play such wonders without being God?"
