    "translation": "Neither I nor all the sages born before you know fully the omnipotent Personality of Godhead. So what can others, who are born after us, know about Him? Even the first incarnation of the Lord, namely Çeña, has not been able to reach the limit of such knowledge, although He is describing the qualities of the Lord with ten hundred faces.",

As such, the potential expansions can never be calculated by anyone because even the Personality of God Himself, as the incarnation of Çeña, cannot estimate the potencies, although He has been describing them continuously with His one thousand faces."
