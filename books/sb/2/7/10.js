    "translation": "The Lord appeared as the son of Sudevé, the wife of King Näbhi, and was known as Åñabhadeva. He performed materialistic yoga to equibalance the mind. This stage is also accepted as the highest perfectional situation of liberation, wherein one is situated in one's self and is completely satisfied.",

            "content": "Out of many types of mystic performances for self-realization, the process of jaòa-yoga is also one accepted by authorities. This jaòa-yoga involves practicing becoming like a dumb stone and not being affected by material reactions. Just as a stone is indifferent to all kinds of attacks and reattacks of external situations, similarly one practices jaòa-yoga by tolerating voluntary infliction of pain upon the material body. Such yogés, out of many self-infliction methods, practice plucking out the hairs on their heads, without shaving and without any instrumental help. But the real purpose of such jaòa-yoga practice is to get free from all material affection and to be completely situated in the self. At the last stage of his life, Emperor Åñabhadeva wandered like a dumb madman, unaffected by all kinds of bodily mistreatment. Seeing him like a madman, wandering naked with long hair and a long beard, less intelligent children and men in the street used to spit on him and urinate on his body. He used to lie in his own stool and never move. But the stool of his body was fragrant like the smell of fragrant flowers, and a saintly person would recognize him as a paramahaàsa, one in the highest state of human perfection. One who is not able to make his stool fragrant should not, however, imitate Emperor Åñabhadeva. The practice of jaòa-yoga was possible for Åñabhadeva and others on the same level of perfection, but such an uncommon practice is impossible for an ordinary man."

            "content": "The real purpose of jaòa-yoga, as mentioned here in this verse, is praçänta-karaëaù, or subduing the senses. The whole process of yoga, under whatever heading it may be, is to control the unbridled material senses and thus prepare oneself for self-realization. In this age specifically, this jaòa-yoga cannot be of any practical value, but on the other hand the practice of bhakti-yoga is feasible because it is just suitable for this age. The simple method of hearing from the right source, Çrémad-Bhägavatam, will lead one to the highest perfectional stage of yoga. Åñabhadeva was the son of King Näbhi and the grandson of King Ägnédhra, and he was the father of King Bharata, after whose name this planet earth was called Bhärata-varña. Åñabhadeva's mother was also known as Merudevé, although her name is mentioned here as Sudevé. It is sometimes proposed that Sudevé was another wife of King Näbhi, but since King Åñabhadeva is mentioned elsewhere as the son of Merudevé, it is clear that Merudevé and Sudevé are the same person under different names."
