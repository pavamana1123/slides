    "translation": "Lord Kåñëa saved His foster father, Nanda Mahäräja, from the fear of the demigod Varuëa and released the cowherd boys from the caves of the mountain, for they were placed there by the son of Maya. Also, to the inhabitants of Våndävana, who were busy working during daytime and sleeping soundly at night because of their hard labor in the day, Lord Kåñëa awarded promotion to the highest planet in the spiritual sky. All these acts are transcendental and certainly prove without any doubt His Godhood.",

            "content": "Nanda Mahäräja, the foster father of Lord Kåñëa, went to take his bath in the River Yamunä in the dead of night, mistakenly thinking that the night was already over; thus the demigod Varuëa took him to the Varuëa planet just to have a look at the Personality of Godhead Lord Kåñëa, who appeared there to release His father. Actually there was no arrest of Nanda Mahäräja by Varuëa because the inhabitants of Våndävana were always engaged in thinking of Kåñëa, in constant meditation on the Personality of Godhead in a particular form of samadhi, or trance of bhakti-yoga. They had no fear of the miseries of material existence. In the Bhagavad-gétä it is confirmed that to be in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by full surrender in transcendental love frees one from the miseries inflicted by the laws of material nature. Here it is clearly mentioned that the inhabitants of Våndävana were extensively busy in the hard labor of their day's work, and due to the day's hard labor they were engaged in sound sleep at night. So practically they had very little time to devote to meditation or to the other paraphernalia of spiritual activities. But factually they were engaged in the highest spiritual activities only. Everything done by them was spiritualized because everything was dovetailed in their relationship with Lord Çré Kåñëa. The central point of activities was Kåñëa, and as such the so-called activities in the material world were saturated with spiritual potency. That is the advantage of the way of bhakti-yoga. One should discharge one's duty on Lord Kåñëa's behalf, and all one's actions will be saturated with Kåñëa thought, the highest pattern of trance in spiritual realization."
