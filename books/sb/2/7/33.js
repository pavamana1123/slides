    "translation": "When the Lord was engaged in His pastimes of the räsa dance in the forest of Våndävana, enlivening the sexual desires of the wives of the inhabitants of Våndävana by sweet and melodious songs, a demon of the name Çaìkhacüòa, a rich follower of the treasurer of heaven [Kuvera], kidnapped the damsels, and the Lord severed his head from his trunk.",

            "content": "We should carefully note that the statements described herein are the statements of Brahmäjé to Närada, and he was speaking to Närada of events that would happen in the future, during the advent of Lord Kåñëa. The pastimes of the Lord are known to the experts who are able to see past, present and future, and Brahmäjé, being one of them, foretold what would happen in the future. The killing of Çaìkhacüòa by the Lord is a more recent incident, after the räsa-lélä, and not exactly a simultaneous affair. In the previous verses we have seen also that the Lord's engagement in the affairs of the forest fire was described along with His pastimes of punishing the Käliya snake, and similarly the pastimes of the räsa dance and the killing of Çaìkhacüòa are also described herein. The adjustment is that all these incidents would take place in the future, after the time when it was being foretold by Brahmäjé to Närada. The demon Çaìkhacüòa was killed by the Lord during His pastimes at Horikä in the month of Phälguna, and the same ceremony is still observed in India by the burning of the effigy of Çaìkhacüòa one day prior to the Lord's pastimes at Horikä, generally known as Holi."
