    "translation": "The Personality of Godhead assumed the incarnation of Nåsiàhadeva in order to vanquish the great fears of the demigods. He killed the king of the demons [Hiraëyakaçipu], who challenged the Lord with a club in his hand, by placing the demon on His thighs and piercing him with His nails, rolling His eyebrows in anger and showing His fearful teeth and mouth.",

            "content": "The history of Hiraëyakaçipu and his great devotee-son Prahläda Mahäräja is narrated in the Seventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Hiraëyakaçipu became very powerful by material achievements and thought himself to be immortal by the grace of Brahmäjé. Brahmäjé declined to award him the benediction of immortality because he himself is not an immortal being. But Hiraëyakaçipu derived Brahmäjé's benediction in a roundabout way, almost equal to becoming an immortal being. Hiraëyakaçipu was sure that he would not be killed by any man or demigod or by any kind of known weapon, nor would he die in day or night. The Lord, however, assumed the incarnation of half-man and half-lion, which was beyond the imagination of a materialistic demon like Hiraëyakaçipu, and thus, keeping pace with the benediction of Brahmäjé, the Lord killed him. He killed him on His lap, so that he was killed neither on the land nor on the water nor in the sky. The demon was pierced by Nåsiàha's nails, which were beyond the human weapons imaginable by Hiraëyakaçipu. The literal meaning of Hiraëyakaçipu is one who is after gold and soft bedding, the ultimate aim of all materialistic men. Such demonic men, who have no relationship with God, gradually become puffed up by material acquisitions and begin to challenge the authority of the Supreme Lord and torture those who are devotees of the Lord. Prahläda Mahäräja happened to be the son of Hiraëyakaçipu, and because the boy was a great devotee, his father tortured him to the best of his ability. In this extreme situation, the Lord assumed the incarnation of Nåsiàhadeva, and just to finish the enemy of the demigods, the Lord killed Hiraëyakaçipu in a manner beyond the demon's imagination. Materialistic plans of godless demons are always frustrated by the all-powerful Lord."
