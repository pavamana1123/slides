By this King Vena was burnt with his good deeds and opulence and was en route to hell.

            "content": "According to the system of varëäçrama-dharma, the pious and learned brähmaëas were the natural guardians of society. The brähmaëas, by their learned labor of love, would instruct the administrator-kings how to rule the country in complete righteousness, and thus the process would go on as a perfect welfare state. The kings or the kñatriya administrators would always consult the council of learned brähmaëas. They were never autocratic monarchs. The scriptures like Manu-saàhitä and other authorized books of the great sages were guiding principles for ruling the subjects, and there was no need for less intelligent persons to manufacture a code of law in the name of democracy. The less intelligent mass of people have very little knowledge of their own welfare, as a child has very little knowledge of its future well-being. The experienced father guides the innocent child towards the path of progress, and the childlike mass of people need similar guidance. The standard welfare codes are already there in the Manu-saàhitä and other Vedic literatures. The learned brähmaëas would advise the king in terms of those standard books of knowledge and with reference to the particular situation of time and place. Such brähmaëas were not paid servants of the king, and therefore they had the strength to dictate to the king on the principles of scriptures. This system continued even up to the time of Mahäräja Candragupta, and the brähmaëa Cäëakya was his unpaid prime minister."

The broad-minded brähmaëas were not self-interested, but looked to the interest of complete welfare for all the subjects. They wanted to chastise King Vena for his misconduct and so prayed to the Almighty Lord as well as cursed the king."

One should strictly try to follow in the footsteps of great souls. Mahäräja Vena became a king, undoubtedly due to his past deeds of righteousness, but because he willfully neglected the great souls, he was punished by the loss of all the above-mentioned acquisitions. In the Vämana Puräëa the history of Mahäräja Vena and his degradation are fully described. When Mahäräja Påthu heard about the hellish condition of his father, Vena, who was suffering from leprosy in the family of a mleccha, he at once brought the former king to Kurukñetra for his purification and relieved him of all sufferings."

But, at the same time, he performed the duty of a son who delivers his father from hellish conditions. The word putra means one who delivers from hell, called put. That is a worthy son."
