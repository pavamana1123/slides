    "translation": "Due to His causeless mercy upon all living entities within the universe, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with His plenary extensions, appeared in the family of Mahäräja Ikñväku as the Lord of His internal potency, Sétä. Under the order of His father, Mahäräja Daçaratha, He entered the forest and lived there for considerable years with His wife and younger brother. Rävaëa, who was very materially powerful, with ten heads on his shoulders, committed a great offense against Him and was thus ultimately vanquished.",

All four brothers are viñëu-tattva and were never ordinary human beings. There are many unscrupulous and ignorant commentators on Rämäyaëa who present the younger brothers of Lord Rämacandra as ordinary living entities. But here in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the most authentic scripture on the science of Godhead, it is clearly stated that His brothers were His plenary expansions. Originally Lord Rämacandra is the incarnation of Väsudeva, Lakñmaëa is the incarnation of Saìkarñaëa, Bharata is the incarnation of Pradyumna, and Çatrughna is the incarnation of Aniruddha, expansions of the Personality of Godhead. Lakñméjé Sétä is the internal potency of the Lord and is neither an ordinary woman nor the external potency incarnation of Durgä. Durgä is the external potency of the Lord, and she is associated with Lord Çiva."

One of His younger brothers, Lakñmaëajé, desired to go with Him, and so also His eternal wife, Sétäjé, desired to go with Him. The Lord agreed to both of them, and all together they entered the Daëòakäraëya Forest, to live there for fourteen years. During their stay in the forest, there was some quarrel between Rämacandra and Rävaëa, and the latter kidnapped the Lord's wife, Sétä. The quarrel ended in the vanquishing of the greatly powerful Rävaëa, along with all his kingdom and family."

She is meant for being worshiped by the living being along with her husband, Çré Rämacandra. A materialistic man like Rävaëa does not understand this great truth, but on the contrary he wants to snatch Sétädevé from the custody of Räma and thus incurs great miseries. The materialists, who are after opulence and material prosperity, may take lessons from the Rämäyaëa that the policy of exploiting the nature of the Lord without acknowledging the supremacy of the Supreme Lord is the policy of Rävaëa. Rävaëa was very advanced materially, so much so that he turned his kingdom, Laìkä, into pure gold, or full material wealth. But because he did not recognize the supremacy of Lord Rämacandra and defied Him by stealing His wife, Sétä, Rävaëa was killed, and all his opulence and power were destroyed."
