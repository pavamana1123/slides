            "content": "Lord Çré Kåñëa is the complete form of all existence, both material and spiritual. Akhila means complete, or that which is not khila, inferior. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, there are two kinds of nature (prakåti), namely the material nature and the spiritual nature, or the external and internal potencies of the Lord. The material nature is called aparä, or inferior, and the spiritual nature is called superior or transcendental. Therefore the form of the Lord is not of the inferior, material nature. He is complete transcendence. And He is mürti, or having transcendental form. The less intelligent men, who are unaware of His transcendental form, describe Him as impersonal Brahman. But Brahman is simply the rays of His transcendental body (yasya prabhä (BS 5.40)). The devotees, who are aware of His transcendental form, render Him service; therefore the Lord also reciprocates by His causeless mercy and thus delivers His devotees from all distresses. The pious men who follow the rulings of the Vedas are also dear to Him, and therefore the pious men of this world are also protected by Him. The impious and the nondevotees are against the principles of the Vedas, and so such persons are always hampered from making advances in their nefarious activities. Some of them, who are specially favored by the Lord, are killed by Him personally, as in the cases of Rävaëa, Hiraëyakaçipu and Kaàsa, and thus such demons get salvation and are thereby checked from further progress in their demoniac activities. Just like a kind father, either in His favor upon the devotees or His punishment of the demons He is ever kind to everyone because He is the complete existence for all individual existence."

            "content": "The paramahaàsa stage of existence is the highest perfectional stage of spiritual values. According to Çrématé Kuntédevé, the Lord is factually understood by the paramahaàsas only. As there is gradual realization of the transcendence from impersonal Brahman to localized Paramätmä to the Personality of Godhead, Puruñottama, Lord Kåñëa, similarly there is gradual promotion of one's situation in the spiritual life of sannyäsa. Kuöécaka, bahüdaka, parivräjakäcärya and paramahaàsa are gradual progressive stages in the renounced order of life, sannyäsa, and Queen Kuntédevé, the mother of the Päëòavas, has spoken about them in her prayers for Lord Kåñëa ) especially to award bhakti-yoga to the paramahaàsas. So ultimately the paramahaàsas, in the true sense of the term, are unalloyed devotees of the Lord. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has directly accepted that the highest destination is bhakti-yoga, by which one accepts the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Those who accept the path of bhakti-yoga are the factual paramahaàsas."

            "content": "Since the Lord is very kind to everyone, the impersonalists, who accept bhakti as the means of merging in the existence of the Lord in His impersonal brahmajyoti, are also awarded their desired destination. He has assured everyone in the Bhagavad-gétä : ye yathä mäà prapadyante. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, there are two classes of paramahaàsas, namely the brahmänandés (impersonalists) and the premänandés (devotees), and both are awarded their desired destinations, although the premänandés are more fortunate than the brahmänandés. But both the brahmänandés and the premänandés are transcendentalists, and they have nothing to do with the inferior, material nature full of the existential miseries of life."
