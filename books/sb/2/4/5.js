In other words, reception of the messages of Çrémad-Bhägavatam from professional men, heard by a karma-käëòéya audience, never acts miraculously as stated here. Devotional hearing of the messages of the Lord is not like hearing ordinary topics; therefore the action will be felt by the sincere hearer by experience of the gradual disappearance of ignorance."

Thus he does not have to ask whether he has actually been fed or not. The crucial test of hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam is that one should get positive enlightenment by such an act."
