            "content": "The Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, although the Lord of all followers of different paths of self-realization, is knowable only by those who are above all pretensions. Everyone is searching for eternal peace or eternal life, and with an aim to this destination everyone is either studying the Vedic scriptures or other religious scriptures or undergoing severe austerity as empiric philosophers, as mystics yogés or as unalloyed devotees, etc. But the Supreme Lord is perfectly realized only by the devotees because they are above all pretensions. Those who are on the path of self-realization are generally classified as karmés, jïänés, yogés, or devotees of the Lord. The karmés, who are much attracted by the fruitive activities of the Vedic rituals, are called bhukti-kämé, or those who desire material enjoyment. The jïänés, who try to become one with the Supreme by mental speculation, are called mukti-kämé, or those who desire liberation from material existence. The mystic yogés, who practice different types of austerities for attainment of eight kinds of material perfection and who ultimately meet the Supersoul (Paramätmä) in trance, are called siddhi-kämé, or those who desire the perfection of becoming finer than the finest, becoming heavier than the heaviest, getting everything desired, having control over everyone, creating everything liked, etc. All these are abilities of a powerful yogé. But the devotees of the Lord do not want anything like that for self-satisfaction. They want only to serve the Lord because the Lord is great and as living entities they are eternally subordinate parts and parcels of the Lord. This perfect realization of the self by the devotee helps him to become desireless, to desire nothing for his personal self, and thus the devotees are called niñkämé, without any desire. A living entity, by his constitutional position, cannot be void of all desires (the bhukti-kämé, mukti-kämé and siddhi-kämé all desire something for personal satisfaction), but the niñkämé devotees of the Lord desire everything for the satisfaction of the Lord. They are completely dependent on the orders of the Lord and are always ready to discharge their duty for the satisfaction of the Lord."

Because Arjuna was without any pretension, he changed his decision and satisfied the Lord by agreeing to fight (kariñye vacanaà tava) , and thus he became desireless."

They are all freed from all pretensions. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé interprets the word gata-vyalékaiù as projjhita-kaitavaiù, or those who are freed from all pretensions (the unalloyed devotees only).

The conclusion is, therefore, that the Lord is for everyone because no one can achieve the result of his respective desires without His sanction, but as stated by the Lord in Bhagavad-gétä , all such results are awarded by Him only, for the Lord is adhéçvara (the original controller) of everyone, namely the Vedäntists, the great karma-käëòéyas, the great religious leaders, the great performers of austerity and all who are striving for spiritual advancement. But ultimately He is realized by the pretensionless devotees only. Therefore special stress is given to the devotional service of the Lord by Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé."
