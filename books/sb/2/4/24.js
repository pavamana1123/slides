            "content": "In pursuance of the specific utterance vedhase, or \"the compiler of the system of transcendental knowledge,\" Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has commented that the respectful obeisances are offered to Çréla Vyäsadeva, who is the incarnation of Väsudeva. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has agreed to this, but Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has made a further advance, namely that the nectar from the mouth of Lord Kåñëa is transferred to His different consorts, and thus they learn the finer arts of music, dance, dressing, decorations and all such things which are relished by the Lord. Such music, dance and decorations enjoyed by the Lord are certainly not anything mundane, because the Lord is addressed in the very beginning as para, or transcendental. This transcendental knowledge is unknown to the forgotten conditioned souls. Çréla Vyäsadeva, who is the incarnation of the Lord, thus compiled the Vedic literatures to revive the lost memory of the conditioned souls about their eternal relation with the Lord. One should therefore try to understand the Vedic scriptures, or the nectar transferred by the Lord to His consorts in the conjugal humor, from the lotuslike mouth of Vyäsadeva or Çukadeva. By gradual development of transcendental knowledge, one can rise to the stage of the transcendental arts of music and dance displayed by the Lord in His räsa-lélä. But without having the Vedic knowledge one can hardly understand the transcendental nature of the Lord's räsa dance and music. The pure devotees of the Lord, however, can equally relish the nectar in the form of the profound philosophical discourses and in the form of kissing by the Lord in the räsa dance, as there is no mundane distinction between the two."
