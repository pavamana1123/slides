The Greeks are known as Pulindas, and it is mentioned in the Vana-parva of Mahäbhärata that the non-Vedic race of this part of the world would rule over the world. This Pulinda province was also one of the provinces of Bhärata, and the inhabitants were classified amongst the kñatriya kings. But later on, due to their giving up the brahminical culture, they were mentioned as mlecchas (just as those who are not followers of the Islamic culture are called kafirs and those who are not followers of the Christian culture are called heathens)."

They were under the domination of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, and according to the statements of Märkaëòeya the mlecchas of this part of the world would also rule over Bhärata. Later on this proved to be true, as in the case of the Pulindas. On behalf of the Pulindas, Alexander the Great conquered India, and on behalf of the Äbhéras, Muhammad Ghori conquered India. These Äbhéras were also formerly kñatriyas within the brahminical culture, but they gave up the connection. The kñatriyas who were afraid of Paraçuräma and had hidden themselves in the Caucasian hilly regions later on became known as the Äbhéras, and the place they inhabited was known as Äbhéradeça."

Descriptions of the Yavanas are in the Mahäbhärata (Adi-parva 85.34). Another prince called Turvasu was also known as Yavana, and his country was conquered by Sahadeva, one of the Päëòavas. The western Yavana joined with Duryodhana in the Battle of Kurukñetra under the pressure of Karëa. It is also foretold that these Yavanas also would conquer India, and it proved to be true."

Even those who are constantly engaged in sinful acts are all corrigible to the standard of perfect human beings if they take shelter of the devotees of the Lord. Jesus Christ and Muhammad, two powerful devotees of the Lord, have done tremendous service on behalf of the Lord on the surface of the globe. And from the version of Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé it appears that instead of running a godless civilization in the present context of the world situation, if the leadership of world affairs is entrusted to the devotees of the Lord, for which a worldwide organization under the name and style of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness has already been started, then by the grace of the Almighty Lord there can be a thorough change of heart in human beings all over the world because the devotees of the Lord are able authorities to effect such a change by purifying the dust-worn minds of the people in general. The politicians of the world may remain in their respective positions because the pure devotees of the Lord are not interested in political leadership or diplomatic implications. The devotees are interested only in seeing that the people in general are not misguided by political propaganda and in seeing that the valuable life of a human being is not spoiled in following a type of civilization which is ultimately doomed. If the politicians, therefore, would be guided by the good counsel of the devotees, then certainly there would be a great change in the world situation by the purifying propaganda of the devotees, as shown by Lord Caitanya. As Çukadeva Gosvämé began his prayer by discussing the word yat-kértanam, so also Lord Caitanya recommended that simply by glorifying the Lord's holy name, a tremendous change of heart can take place by which the complete misunderstanding between the human nations created by politicians can at once be extinguished. And after the extinction of the fire of misunderstanding, other profits will follow. The destination is to go back home, back to Godhead, as we have several times discussed in these pages."

            "content": "According to the cult of devotion, generally known as the Vaiñëava cult, there is no bar against anyone's advancing in the matter of God realization. A Vaiñëava is powerful enough to turn into a Vaiñëava even the Kiräta, etc., as above mentioned. In the Bhagavad-gétä  it is said by the Lord that there is no bar to becoming a devotee of the Lord (even for those who are lowborn, or women, çüdras or vaiçyas), and by becoming a devotee everyone is eligible to return home, back to Godhead. The only qualification is that one take shelter of a pure devotee of the Lord who has thorough knowledge in the transcendental science of Kåñëa (Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam). Anyone from any part of the world who becomes well conversant in the science of Kåñëa becomes a pure devotee and a spiritual master for the general mass of people and may reclaim them by purification of heart. Though a person be even the most sinful man, he can at once be purified by systematic contact with a pure Vaiñëava. A Vaiñëava, therefore, can accept a bona fide disciple from any part of the world without any consideration of caste and creed and promote him by regulative principles to the status of a pure Vaiñëava who is transcendental to brahminical culture. The system of caste, or varëäçrama-dharma, is no longer regular even amongst the so-called followers of the system. Nor is it now possible to reestablish the institutional function in the present context of social, political and economic revolution. Without any reference to the particular custom of a country, one can be accepted to the Vaiñëava cult spiritually, and there is no hindrance in the transcendental process. So by the order of Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, the cult of Çrémad-Bhägavatam or the Bhagavad-gétä can be preached all over the world, reclaiming all persons willing to accept the transcendental cult. Such cultural propaganda by the devotees will certainly be accepted by all persons who are reasonable and inquisitive, without any particular bias for the custom of the country. The Vaiñëava never accepts another Vaiñëava on the basis of birthright, just as he never thinks of the Deity of the Lord in a temple as an idol. And to remove all doubts in this connection, Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé has invoked the blessings of the Lord, who is all-powerful (prabhaviñëave namaù). As the all-powerful Lord accepts the humble service of His devotee in devotional activities of the arcana, His form as the worshipable Deity in the temple, similarly the body of a pure Vaiñëava changes transcendentally at once when he gives himself up to the service of the Lord and is trained by a qualified Vaiñëava. The injunction of Vaiñëava regulation in this connection runs as follows: arcye viñëau çilä-dhér guruñu nara-matir vaiñëave jäti-buddhiù çré-viñëor nämni çabda-sämänya-buddhiù, etc. \"One should not consider the Deity of the Lord as worshiped in the temple to be an idol, nor should one consider the authorized spiritual master an ordinary man. Nor should one consider a pure Vaiñëava to belong to a particular caste, etc.\" (Padma Puräëa)"

That is the way of self-realization."
