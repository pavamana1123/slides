Without Vedic knowledge, or perfect, infallible knowledge, no one can create anything. All scientific knowledge and perfect knowledge are Vedic. One can get all types of information from the Vedas, and as such, Brahmä was impregnated with all-perfect knowledge so that it was possible for him to create. Thus Brahmä knew the perfect description of creation, as it was exactly apprised to him by the Supreme Lord Hari. Brahmä, on being questioned by Närada, told Närada exactly what he had heard directly from the Lord. Närada again told exactly the same thing to Vyäsa, and Vyäsa also told Çukadeva exactly what he heard from Närada. And Çukadeva was going to repeat the same statements as he had heard them from Vyäsa. That is the way of Vedic understanding. The language of the Vedas can be revealed only by the above-mentioned disciplic succession, and not otherwise."

Therefore the statements of creation explained by Çukadeva Gosvämé are not at all, as the mundaners suggest, theoretical, but are perfectly correct. One who hears these messages and tries to assimilate them gets perfect information of the material creation."
