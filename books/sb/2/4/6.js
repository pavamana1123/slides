            "content": "In every inquisitive mind the important question of the creation of the phenomenal world arises, and therefore for a personality like Mahäräja Parékñit, who was to know all the activities of the Lord from his spiritual master, such an inquiry is not uncommon. For every unknown thing, we have to learn and inquire from a learned personality. The question of creation is also one of such inquiries to be made to the right person. The spiritual master, therefore, must be one who is sama jïa, as stated hereinbefore in connection with Çukadeva Gosvämé. Thus all inquiries on God which are unknown to the disciple may be made from the qualified spiritual master, and here the practical example is set by Mahäräja Parékñit. It was, however, already known to Mahäräja Parékñit that everything we see is born out of the energy of the Lord, as we have all learned in the very beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (janmädy asya yataù ). An inexperienced boy may be struck with wonder by seeing the impersonal actions of electronics or many other wonderful things conducted by electrical energy, but an experienced man knows that behind the action is a living man who creates such energy. Similarly the so-called scholars and philosophers of the world may, by mental speculation, present so many utopian theories about the impersonal creation of the universe, but an intelligent devotee of the Lord, by studying the Bhagavad-gétä, can know that behind the creation is the hand of the Supreme Lord, just as in the generating electrical powerhouse there is the resident engineer. The research scholar finds out the cause and the effect of everything, but research scholars as great as Brahmä, Çiva, Indra and many other demigods are sometimes bewildered by seeing the wonderful creative energy of the Lord, so what to speak of the tiny mundane scholars dealing in petty things. As there are differences in the living conditions of different planets of the universe, and as one planet is superior to others, the brains of the living entities in those respective planets are also of different categorical values. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, one can compare the long duration of life of the inhabitants of Brahmä's planet, which is inconceivable to the inhabitants of this planet earth, to the categorical value of the brain of Brahmäjé, also inconceivable to any great scientist of this planet. And with such high brain power, even Brahmäjé has described in his great saàhitä (BS 5.1) as follows:"

They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.\"  Brahmä and Çiva (and what to speak of other demigods) are bhütas, or powerful created demigods who manage universal affairs, much like ministers appointed by a king. The ministers may be éçvaras, or controllers, but the Supreme Lord is maheçvara, or the creator of the controllers. Persons with a poor fund of knowledge do not know this, and therefore they have the audacity to deride Him because He comes before us by His causeless mercy occasionally as a human being. The Lord is not like a human being. He is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1), or the Absolute Personality of Godhead, and there is no difference between His body and His soul. He is both the power and the powerful."

            "content": "Mahäräja Parékñit did not ask his spiritual master, Çukadeva Gosvämé, to narrate Lord Kåñëa's pastimes in Våndävana; he wanted to hear first about the creation of the Lord. Çukadeva Gosvämé did not say that the King should hear about the direct transcendental pastimes of the Lord. The time was very short, and naturally Çukadeva Gosvämé could have gone directly to the Tenth Canto to make a shortcut of the whole thing, as generally done by the professional reciters. But neither the King nor the great speaker of Çrémad-Bhägavatam jumped up like the organizers of Bhägavatam; both of them proceeded systematically, so that both future readers and hearers might take lessons from the example of the procedure of reciting Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Those who are in control of the external energy of the Lord, or in other words those who are in the material world, must first of all know how the external energy of the Lord is working under the direction of the Supreme Personality, and afterwards one may try to enter into the activities of His internal energy. The mundaners are mostly worshipers of Durgä-devé, the external energy of Kåñëa, but they do not know that Durgä-devé is but the shadow energy of the Lord. Behind her astonishing display of material workings is the direction of the Lord, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä . The Brahma-saàhitä affirms that Durgä-çakti is working by the direction of Govinda, and without His sanction the powerful Durgä-çakti cannot move even a blade of grass. Therefore the neophyte devotee, instead of jumping at once to the platform of transcendental pastimes presented by the internal energy of the Lord, may know how great the Supreme Lord is by inquiring about the process of His creative energy. In the Caitanya-caritämåta also, descriptions of the creative energy and the Lord's hand in it are explained, and the author of Caitanya-caritämåta has warned the neophyte devotees to be seriously on guard against the pitfall of neglecting knowledge about Kåñëa in regard to how great He is. Only when one knows Lord Kåñëa's greatness can one firmly put one's unflinching faith in Him; otherwise, like the common man, even the great leaders of men will mistake Lord Kåñëa for one of the many demigods, or a historical personality, or a myth only. The transcendental pastimes of the Lord in Våndävana, or even at Dvärakä, are relishable for persons who have already qualified themselves in advanced spiritual techniques, and the common man may be able to attain to such a plane by the gradual process of service and inquiries, as we shall see in the behavior of Mahäräja Parékñit."
