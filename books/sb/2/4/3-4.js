            "content": "The three activities of religion, economic development and sense gratification are generally attractive for conditioned souls struggling for existence in the material world. Such regulated activities prescribed in the Vedas are called the karma-käëòéya conception of life, and householders are generally recommended to follow the rules just to enjoy material prosperity both in this life and in the next. Most people are attracted by such activities. Even in the activities of their modern godless civilization, people are more concerned with economic development and sense gratification without any religious sentiments. As a great emperor of the world, Mahäräja Parékñit had to observe such regulations of the Vedic karma-käëòéya section, but by his slight association with Çukadeva Gosvämé he could perfectly understand that Lord Kåñëa, the Absolute Personality of Godhead (Väsudeva), for whom he had a natural love since his birth, is everything, and thus he fixed his mind firmly upon Him, renouncing all modes of Vedic karma-käëòéya activities. This perfectional stage is attained by a jïäné after many, many births. The jïänés, or the empiric philosophers endeavoring for liberation, are thousands of times better than the fruitive workers, and out of hundreds of thousands of such jïänés one is liberated factually. And out of hundreds of thousands of such liberated persons, even one person is rarely found who can firmly fix his mind unto the lotus feet of Lord Çré Kåñëa, as declared by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gétä . Mahäräja Parékñit is specially qualified with the word mahä-manäù, which puts him on an equal level with the mahätmäs described in the Bhagavad-gétä. In the later age also there have been many mahätmäs of this type, and they also gave up all karma-käëòéya conceptions of life' solely and wholly depending on the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa. Lord Caitanya, who is Lord Kåñëa Himself, taught us in His Çikñäñöaka (8):"
