            "content": "This material world is a manifestation of the three modes goodness, passion and ignorance, and the Supreme Lord, for the creation, maintenance and destruction of the material world, accepts three predominating forms as Brahmä, Viñëu and Çaìkara (Çiva). As Viñëu He enters into every body materially created. As Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu He enters into every universe, and as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu He enters the body of every living being. Lord Çré Kåñëa, being the origin of all viñëu-tattvas, is addressed here as paraù pumän, or Puruñottama, as described in the Bhagavad-gétä . He is the complete whole. The puruñävatäras are therefore His plenary expansions. Bhakti-yoga is the only process by which one can become competent to know Him. Because the empiric philosophers and mystic yogés cannot conceive of the Personality of Godhead, He is called anupalakñya-vartmane, the Lord of the inconceivable way, or bhakti-yoga."
