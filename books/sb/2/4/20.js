Everyone is seeking the favor of the goddess of fortune, but people do not know that Lord Çré Kåñëa is the beloved husband of all goddesses of fortune. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is said that the Lord, in His transcendental abode Goloka Våndävana, is accustomed to herding the surabhi cows and is served there by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune. All these goddesses of fortune are manifestations of His transcendental pleasure potency (hlädiné-çakti) in His internal energy, and when the Lord manifested Himself on this earth He partially displayed the activities of His pleasure potency in His räsa-lélä just to attract the conditioned souls, who are all after the phantasmagoria pleasure potency in degraded sex enjoyment. The pure devotees of the Lord like Çukadeva Gosvämé, who was completely detached from the abominable sex life of the material world, discussed this act of the Lord's pleasure potency certainly not in relation to sex, but to relish a transcendental taste inconceivable to the mundaners who are after sex life. Sex life in the mundane world is the root-cause of being conditioned by the shackles of illusion, and certainly Çukadeva Gosvämé was never interested in the sex life of the mundane world. Nor does the manifestation of the Lord's pleasure potency have any connection with such degraded things. Lord Caitanya was a strict sannyäsé, so much so that He did not allow any woman to come near Him, not even to bow down and offer respects. He never even heard the prayers of the deva-däsés offered in the temple of Jagannätha because a sannyäsé is forbidden to hear songs sung by the fair sex. Yet even in the rigid position of a sannyäsé He recommended the mode of worship preferred by the gopés of Våndävana as the topmost loving service possible to be rendered to the Lord. And Çrématé Rädhäräëé is the principal head of all such goddesses of fortune, and therefore She is the pleasure counterpart of the Lord and is nondifferent from Kåñëa."

            "content": "In the Vedic rituals there are recommendations for performing different types of sacrifice in order to achieve the greatest benefit in life. Such benedictions as the results of performing great sacrifices are, after all, favors given by the goddess of fortune, and the Lord, being the husband or lover of the goddess of fortune, is factually the Lord of all sacrifices also. He is the final enjoyer of all kinds of yajïa; therefore Yajïa-pati is another name of Lord Viñëu. It is recommended in the Bhagavad-gétä that everything be done for the Yajïa-pati (yajïärtät karmaëaù), for otherwise one's acts will be the cause of conditioning by the law of material nature. Those who are not freed from all misconceptions (vyalékam) perform sacrifices to please the minor demigods, but the devotees of the Lord know very well that Lord Çré Kåñëa is the supreme enjoyer of all performances of sacrifice; therefore they perform the saìkértana-yajïa (çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù ), which is especially recommended in this age of Kali. In Kali-yuga, performance of other types of sacrifice is not feasible due to insufficient arrangements and inexpert priesthood."

With such sacrificial performances the conditioned souls will never be in difficulty in keeping body and soul together. Ultimately they can purify their existence. They will find natural promotion into spiritual existence, the real identity of the living being. A conditioned soul should never give up the practice of sacrifice, charity and austerity, in any circumstances. The aim of all such sacrifices is to please the Yajïa-pati, the Personality of Godhead; therefore the Lord is also Prajä-pati. According to the Kaöha Upaniñad, the one Lord is the leader of the innumerable living entities. The living entities are maintained by the Lord (eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän). The Lord is therefore called the supreme Bhüta-bhåt, or maintainer of all living beings."

All living beings are not equally endowed with the same quality of intelligence because behind such development of intelligence is the control of the Lord, as declared in the Bhagavad-gétä . As Paramätmä, Supersoul, the Lord is living in everyone's heart, and from Him only does one's power of remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness follow (mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca). One person can sharply remember past activities by the grace of the Lord while others cannot. One is highly intelligent by the grace of the Lord, and one is a fool by the same control. Therefore the Lord is Dhiyäm-pati, or the Lord of intelligence."

This misuse of intelligence by the conditioned soul is called madness. One's full intelligence should be applied to get free from the material clutches. But the conditioned soul, due to madness only, engages his full energy and intelligence in sense gratification, and to achieve this end of life he willfully commits all sorts of misdeeds. The result is that instead of attaining an unconditional life of full freedom, the mad conditioned soul is entangled again and again in different types of bondage in material bodies. Everything we see in the material manifestation is but the creation of the Lord. Therefore He is the real proprietor of everything in the universes. The conditioned soul can enjoy a fragment of this material creation under the control of the Lord, but not self-sufficiently. That is the instruction in the Éçopaniñad. One should be satisfied with things awarded by the Lord of the universe. It is out of madness only that one tries to encroach upon another's share of material possessions."

He instructs all to surrender unto Him instead of falsely claiming to be enjoyers for a certain limit under His control. When He so descends He proves how much greater is His ability to enjoy, and He exhibits His power of enjoyment by (for instance) marrying sixteen thousand wives at once. The conditioned soul is very proud of becoming the husband of even one wife, but the Lord laughs at this; the intelligent man can know who is the real husband. Factually, the Lord is the husband of all the women in His creation, but a conditioned soul under the control of the Lord feels proud to be the husband of one or two wives."

The members of the Yadu dynasty knew that Lord Çré Kåñëa is everything, and all of them intended to return to Lord Kåñëa after He had finished His transcendental pastimes on the earth. The Yadu dynasty was annihilated by the will of the Lord because its members had to return home with the Lord. The annihilation of the Yadu dynasty was a material show created by the Supreme Lord; otherwise the Lord and the members of the Yadu dynasty are all eternal associates. The Lord is therefore the guide of all devotees, and as such, Çukadeva Gosvämé offered Him due respects with love-laden feelings."
