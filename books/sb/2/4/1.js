            "content": "The word satém is very significant. This means \"existing\" and \"chaste.\" And both imports are perfectly applicable in the case of Mahäräja Parékñit. The whole Vedic adventure is to draw one's attention entirely unto the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa without any diversion, as instructed in the Bhagavad-gétä . Fortunately Mahäräja Parékñit had already been attracted to the Lord from the very beginning of his body, in the womb of his mother. In the womb of his mother he was struck by the brahmästra atomic bomb released by Açvatthämä, but by the grace of the Lord he was saved from being burnt by the fiery weapon, and since then the King continuously concentrated his mind upon Lord Kåñëa, which made him perfectly chaste in devotional service. So by natural sequence he was a chaste devotee of the Lord, and when he further heard from Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé that one should worship the Lord only and no one else, even though full of all desires or desireless, his natural affection for Kåñëa was strengthened. We have already discussed these topics."

            "content": "To become a pure devotee of Lord Kåñëa, two things are very much essential, namely having a chance to be born in the family of a devotee and having the blessings of a bona fide spiritual master. By the grace of Lord Kåñëa, Parékñit Mahäräja had both opportunities. He was born in a family of such devotees as the Päëòavas, and just to continue the dynasty of the Päëòavas and show them special favor, the Lord specifically saved Mahäräja Parékñit, who later on, by the arrangement of the Lord, was cursed by the boy of a brähmaëa and was able to get the association of such a spiritual master as Çukadeva Gosvämé. In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is said that a fortunate person, by the mercy of the spiritual master and Lord Kåñëa, achieves the path of devotional service. This was perfectly applicable in the case of Mahäräja Parékñit. By way of being born in a family of devotees, he automatically came in touch with Kåñëa, and after being so contacted he constantly remembered Him. Consequently Lord Kåñëa gave the King a further chance for development in devotional service by introducing him to Çukadeva Gosvämé, a stalwart devotee of the Lord with perfect knowledge in self-realization. And by hearing from a bona fide spiritual master, he was perfectly able to concentrate his chaste mind further upon Lord Kåñëa, as a matter of course."
