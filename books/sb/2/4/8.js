And there are innumerable universes, and all of them aggregated together are known as the created material world. And this part of His creation is only a fractional portion of the complete creation. The material world stands as a part only (ekäàçena sthito jagat ). Supposing that the material world is a display of one part of His energy, the remaining three parts consist of the vaikuëöha jagat or spiritual world described in the Bhagavad-gétä as mad-dhäma or sanätana-dhäma, or the eternal world. We have marked in the previous verse that He creates and again winds up the creation. This action is applicable only in the material world because the other, greater part of His creation, namely the Vaikuëöha world, is neither created nor annihilated; otherwise the Vaikuëöha-dhäma would not have been called eternal. The Lord exists with dhäma; His eternal name, quality, pastimes, entourage and personality are all a display of His different energies and expansions. The Lord is called anädi, or having no creator, and ädi, or the origin of all. We think in our own imperfect way that the Lord is also created, but the Vedänta informs us that He is not created. Rather, everything else is created by Him (näräyaëaù paro 'vyaktät). Therefore, for the common man these are all very wonderful matters for consideration. Even for great scholars they are inconceivable, and thus such scholars present theories contradictory to one another. Even for the insignificant part of His creation, this particular universe, they have no complete information as to how far this limited space extends, or how many stars and planets are there, or the different conditions of those innumerable planets. Modern scientists have insufficient knowledge of all this. Some of them assert that there are one hundred million planets scattered all over space. In a news release from Moscow dated 2/21/60, the following piece of knowledge was relayed:"

Vibhüti means \"specific powers,\" and bhinnam means \"variegated.\" Scientists who are attempting to explore outer space and are trying to reach other planets by mechanical arrangements must know for certain that organisms adapted to the atmosphere of earth cannot exist in the atmospheres of other planets (Easy Journey to Other planets). One has to prepare himself, therefore, to be transferred to a different planet after being relieved of the present body, as it is said in the Bhagavad-gétä :"

Why then did he ask Çukadeva Gosvämé for such information? Mahäräja Parékñit, being a great emperor, a descendant of the Päëòavas and a great devotee of Lord Kåñëa, was quite able to know considerably about the creation of the world, but that much knowledge was not sufficient. He said therefore that even greatly learned scholars fail to know about that, even after great effort. The Lord is unlimited, and His activities are also unfathomed. With a limited source of knowledge and with imperfect senses, any living being, up to the standard of Brahmäjé, the highest perfect living being within the universe, can never imagine knowing about the unlimited. We can know something of the unlimited when it is explained by the unlimited, as has been done by the Lord Himself in the unique statements of the Bhagavad-gétä, and it can also be known to some extent from realized souls like Çukadeva Gosvämé, who learned it from Vyäsadeva, a disciple of Närada, and thus the perfect knowledge can descend by the chain of disciplic succession only, and not by any form of experimental knowledge, old or modern."
