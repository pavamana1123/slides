And one who wants to establish a good dynasty and be happy in the progress of temporary bodily relations should take shelter of the Pitäs and the demigods in other pious planets. Such different classes of worshipers of different demigods may ultimately reach the respective planets of those demigods within the universe, but he who reaches the spiritual planets in the brahmajyoti achieves the highest perfection."
