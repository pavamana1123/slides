            "content": "The word satäm is very important in this verse. Satäm means the pure devotees, who have no other desire than to serve the Lord. Only in the association of such devotees are the transcendental glories of Lord Kåñëa properly discussed. It is said by the Lord that His topics are all full of spiritual significance, and once one properly hears about Him in the association of the satäm, certainly one senses the great potency and so automatically attains to the devotional stage of life. As already described, Mahäräja Parékñit was a great devotee of the Lord from his very birth, and so was Çukadeva Gosvämé. Both of them were on the same level, although it appeared that Mahäräja Parékñit was a great king accustomed to royal facilities whereas Çukadeva Gosvämé was a typical renouncer of the world, so much so that he did not even put a cloth on his body. Superficially, Mahäräja Parékñit and Çukadeva Gosvämé might seem to be opposites, but basically they were both unalloyed pure devotees of the Lord. When such devotees are assembled together, there can be no topics save discussions of the glories of the Lord, or bhakti-yoga. In the Bhagavad-gétä also, when there were talks between the Lord and His devotee Arjuna, there could not be any topic other than bhakti-yoga, however the mundane scholars may speculate on it in their own ways. The use of the word ca after vaiyäsakiù suggests, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, that both Çukadeva Gosvämé and Mahäräja Parékñit were of the same category, settled long before, although one was playing the part of the master and the other the disciple. Since Lord Kåñëa is the center of the topics, the word väsudeva-paräyaëaù, or \"devotee of Väsudeva,\" suggests devotee of Lord Kåñëa, the common aim. Although there were many others who assembled at the place where Mahäräja Parékñit was fasting, the natural conclusion is that there was no topic other than the glorification of Lord Kåñëa, because the principal speaker was Çukadeva Gosvämé and the chief audience was Mahäräja Parékñit. So Çrémad-Bhägavatam, as it was spoken and heard by two principal devotees of the Lord, is only for the glorification of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa."
