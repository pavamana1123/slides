But Mahäräja Parékñit was more than that because he had been a great devotee of the Lord since his previous birth, and as such he took his birth in an imperial family of the Kurus, and especially that of the Päëòavas. So from the very beginning of his childhood he had the chance to know intimately the devotional service of Lord Kåñëa in his own family. The Päëòavas, all being devotees of the Lord, certainly venerated family Deities in the royal palace for worship. Children who appear in such families fortunately generally imitate such worship of the Deities, even in the way of childhood play. By the grace of Lord Çré Kåñëa, we had the chance of being born in a Vaiñëava family, and in our childhood we imitated the worship of Lord Kåñëa by imitating our father. Our father encouraged us in all respects to observe all functions such as the Ratha-yäträ and Dola-yäträ ceremonies, and he used to spend money liberally for distributing prasäda to us children and our friends. Our spiritual master, who also took his birth in a Vaiñëava family, got all inspirations from his great Vaiñëava father, Öhäkura Bhaktivinoda. That is the way of all lucky Vaiñëava families. The celebrated Mérä Bäé was a staunch devotee of Lord Kåñëa as the great lifter of Govardhana Hill."

            "content": "The life history of many such devotees is almost the same because there is always symmetry between the early lives of all great devotees of the Lord. According to Jéva Gosvämé, Mahäräja Parékñit must have heard about the childhood pastimes of Lord Kåñëa at Våndävana, for he used to imitate the pastimes with his young playmates. According to Çrédhara Svämé, Mahäräja Parékñit used to imitate the worship of the family Deity by elderly members. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté also confirms the viewpoint of Jéva Gosvämé. So accepting either of them, Mahäräja Parékñit was naturally inclined to Lord Kåñëa from his very childhood. He might have imitated either of the above-mentioned activities, and all of them establish his great devotion from his very childhood, a symptom of a mahä-bhägavata. Such mahä-bhägavatas are called nitya-siddhas, or souls liberated from birth. But there are also others, who may not be liberated from birth but who develop a tendency for devotional service by association, and they are called sädhana-siddhas. There is no difference between the two in the ultimate issue, and so the conclusion is that everyone can become a sädhana-siddha, a devotee of the Lord, simply by association with the pure devotees. The concrete example is our great spiritual master Çré Närada Muni. In his previous life he was simply a boy of a maidservant, but through association with great devotees he became a devotee of the Lord of his own standard, unique in the history of devotional service."
