Brahmäjé, however, refuses to be called this, and he directly offers his respectful obeisances unto Lord Väsudeva, or Çré Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead, as he has already offered the same respects to Him in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38):"

A responsible personality like Brahmäjé refuses to be addressed as the Supreme Lord by his disciples or subordinates, but foolish persons praised by men of the nature of dogs, hogs, camels and asses feel flattered to be addressed as the Supreme Lord. Why such persons take pleasure in being addressed as God, or why such persons are addressed as God by foolish admirers, is explained in the following verse."
