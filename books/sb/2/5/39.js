            "content": "Whenever the Lord incarnates, He does so in His full internal potency (ätma-mäyä), and less intelligent persons mistake Him to be one of the material creations. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, therefore, rightly commenting on this verse, says that the Brahmaloka mentioned here is Vaikuëöha, the kingdom of God, which is sanätana, or eternal, and is therefore not exactly like the material creations described above. The viräö universal form of the Lord is an imagination for the material world. It has nothing to do with the spiritual world, or the kingdom of God."
