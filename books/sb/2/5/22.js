    "translation": "After the incarnation of the first puruña [Käraëärëavaçäyé Viñëu], the mahat-tattva, or the principles of material creation, take place, and then time is manifested, and in course of time the three qualities appear. Nature means the three qualitative appearances. They transform into activities.",

Käla, or time, is the synonym of nature and is the transformed manifestation of the principles of material creation. As such, käla may be taken as the first cause of all creation, and by transformation of nature different activities of the material world become visible. These activities may be taken up as the natural instinct of each and every living being, or even of the inert objects, and after the manifestation of activities there are varieties of products and by-products of the same nature. Originally these are all due to the Supreme Lord. The Vedänta-sütras and the Bhägavatam thus begin with the Absolute Truth as the beginning of all creations (janmädy asya yataù )."
