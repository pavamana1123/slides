He expands Himself by His different energies, as well as by His plenary portions. In a corner of the spiritual sky of brahmajyoti a spiritual cloud sometimes appears, and the covered portion is called the mahat-tattva. The Lord then, by His plenary portion as Mahä-Viñëu, lies down within the water of the mahat-tattva, and the water is called the Causal Ocean (Käraëa-jala). While Mahä-Viñëu sleeps within the Causal Ocean, innumerable universes are generated along with His breathing. These universes are floating, and they are scattered all over the Causal Ocean. They stay only during the breathing period of Mahä-Viñëu. In each and every universal globe, the same Mahä-Viñëu enters again as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and lies there on the serpentlike Çeña incarnation. From His navel sprouts a lotus stem, and on the lotus, Brahmä, the lord of the universe, is born. Brahmä creates all forms of living beings of different shapes in terms of different desires within the universe. He also creates the sun, moon and other demigods."
