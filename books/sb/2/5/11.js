Sometimes less intelligent men have the foolish impression that Brahmä is the cause of all causes. But Närada wanted to clear the matter by the statements of Brahmäjé, the supreme authority in the universe. As the decision of the supreme court of a state is final, similarly the judgment of Brahmäjé, the supreme authority in the universe, is final in the Vedic process of acquiring knowledge. As we have already affirmed in the previous verse, Näradajé was a liberated soul; therefore, he was not one of the less intelligent men who accept a false god or gods in their own ways. He represented himself as less intelligent and yet intelligently presented a doubt to be cleared by the supreme authority so that the uninformed might take note of it and be rightly informed about the intricacies of the creation and the creator."

He has His multifarious potencies (paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate ). Just as the small seed of a banyan fruit has the potency to create a big banyan tree, the Lord disseminates all varieties of seeds by His potential brahmajyoti (sva-rociñä), and the seeds are made to develop by the watering process of persons like Brahmä. Brahmä cannot create the seeds, but he can manifest the seed into a tree, just as a gardener helps plants and orchards to grow by the watering process. The example cited here of the sun is very appropriate. In the material world the sun is the cause of all illumination: fire, electricity, the rays of the moon, etc. All luminaries in the sky are creations of the sun, the sun is the creation of the brahmajyoti, and the brahmajyoti is the effulgence of the Lord. Thus the ultimate cause of creation is the Lord."
