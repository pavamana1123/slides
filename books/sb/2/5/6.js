In human society the human being is considered to be the superior living being, and amongst the human beings there are also different varieties: good, bad, equal, etc. But Närada Muni took for granted that none of them has any source of generation besides his father, Brahmäjé. Therefore he wanted to know all about them from Lord Brahmä."
