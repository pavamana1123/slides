In the previous chapter it has been established that Brahmäjé, the firstborn living entity, received knowledge directly from the Supreme Lord, and the same knowledge was imparted to Närada, the next disciple. Närada asked to receive the knowledge, and Brahmäjé imparted it upon being asked. Therefore, asking for transcendental knowledge from the right person and receiving it properly is the regulation of the disciplic succession. This process is recommended in the Bhagavad-gétä . The inquisitive student must approach a qualified spiritual master to receive transcendental knowledge by surrender, submissive inquiries and service. Knowledge received by submissive inquiries and service is more effective than knowledge received in exchange for money. A spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from Brahmä and Närada has no demand for dollars and cents. A bona fide student has to satisfy him by sincere service to obtain knowledge of the relation and nature of the individual soul and the Supersoul."
