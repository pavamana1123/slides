            "content": "In this verse it is clearly mentioned that the Lord is ajanaù, or the Supreme Person, and that He was showing His transcendental form (ätmano rüpam) to Brahmäjé while instructing him in the summarization of Çrémad-Bhägavatam in four verses. He is ajanaù, or the Supreme Person, amongst janänäm, or all persons. All living entities are individual persons, and amongst all such persons Lord Hari is supreme, as confirmed in the çruti-mantra, nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13). So there is no place for impersonal features in the transcendental world as there are impersonal features in the material world. Whenever there is cetana, or knowledge, the personal feature comes in. In the spiritual world everything is full of knowledge, and therefore everything in the transcendental world, the land, the water, the tree, the mountain, the river, the man, the animal, the bird—everything—is of the same quality, namely cetana, and therefore everything there is individual and personal. Çrémad-Bhägavatam gives us this information as the supreme Vedic literature, and it was personally instructed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to Brahmäjé so that the leader of the living entities might broadcast the message to all in the universe in order to teach the supreme knowledge of bhakti-yoga. Brahmäjé in his turn instructed Närada, his beloved son, the same message of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and Närada, in his turn, taught the same to Vyäsadeva, who again taught it to Çukadeva Gosvämé. Through Çukadeva Gosvämé's grace and by the mercy of Mahäräja Parékñit we are all given Çrémad-Bhägavatam perpetually to learn the science of the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa."
