    "translation": "While thus engaged in thinking, in the water, Brahmäjé heard twice from nearby two syllables joined together. One of the syllables was taken from the sixteenth and the other from the twenty-first of the sparça alphabets, and both joined to become the wealth of the renounced order of life.",

From ka to ma the letters are known as the sparça-varëas, and the sixteenth of the group is called ta, whereas the twenty-first letter is called pa. So when they are joined together, the word tapa, or penance, is constructed. This penance is the beauty and wealth of the brähmaëas and the renounced order of life. According to Bhägavata philosophy, every human being is meant simply for this tapa and for no other business, because by penance only can one realize his self; and self-realization, not sense gratification, is the business of human life. This tapa, or penance, was begun from the very beginning of the creation, and it was first adopted by the supreme spiritual master, Lord Brahmä. By tapasya only can one get the profit of human life, and not by a polished civilization of animal life. The animal does not know anything except sense gratification in the jurisdiction of eat, drink, be merry and enjoy. But the human being is made to undergo tapasya for going back to Godhead, back home."

            "content": "When Lord Brahmä was perplexed about how to construct the material manifestations in the universe and went down within the water to find out the means and the source of his lotus seat, he heard the word tapa vibrated twice. Taking the path of tapa is the second birth of the desiring disciple. The word upäçåëot is very significant. It is similar to upanayana, or bringing the disciple nearer to the spiritual master for the path of tapa. So Brahmäjé was thus initiated by Lord Kåñëa, and this fact is corroborated by Brahmäjé himself in his book the Brahma-saàhitä. In the Brahma-saàhitä Lord Brahmä has sung in every verse govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi. Thus Brahmä was initiated by the Kåñëa mantra, by Lord Kåñëa Himself, and thus he became a Vaiñëava, or a devotee of the Lord, before he was able to construct the huge universe. It is stated in the Brahma-saàhitä that Lord Brahmä was initiated into the eighteen-letter Kåñëa mantra, which is generally accepted by all the devotees of Lord Kåñëa. We follow the same principle because we belong to the Brahmä sampradäya, directly in the disciplic chain from Brahmä to Närada, from Närada to Vyäsa, from Vyäsa to Madhva Muni, from Madhva Muni to Mädhavendra Puré, from Mädhavendra Puré to Éçvara Puré, from Éçvara Puré to Lord Caitanya and gradually to His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, our divine master."
