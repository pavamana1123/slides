But because the devotees are bhakti-yogés, they do not undertake the trouble to meditate upon the impersonal Brahman; as indicated here, they meditate on brahma paramam, or the Supreme Brahman. Brahman realization begins from the impersonal effulgence, but by further progress of such meditation, manifestation of the Supreme Soul, Paramätmä realization, takes place. And progressing further, realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is fixed. Çré Närada Muni, as the spiritual master of Vyäsadeva, knew very well the position of Vyäsadeva, and thus he certified the qualities of Çréla Vyäsadeva as fixed in the Absolute Truth with great vow, etc. Närada advised meditation upon the transcendental activities of the Lord. Impersonal Brahman has no activities, but the Personality of Godhead has many activities, and all such activities are transcendental, without any tinge of material quality. If the activities of the Supreme Brahman were material activities, then Närada would not have advised Vyäsadeva to meditate upon them. And the paraà brahma is Lord Çré Kåñëa, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä. In the Tenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä, when Arjuna realized the factual position of Lord Kåñëa, he addressed Lord Kåñëa in the following words:"

As we have discussed before, the Lord's mäyä, or illusion, is also a representation because mäyä has no existence without the Lord. Darkness is not independent of light. Without light, no one can experience the contraposition of darkness. However, this mäyä, or illusion, cannot overcome the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but stands apart from Him (apäçrayam)."
