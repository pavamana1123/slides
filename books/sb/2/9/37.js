One should not, therefore, try to understand these four verses of Çrémad-Bhägavatam by mental speculation. Rather, by direct perception of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is able to know all about His abode, Vaikuëöha, as was seen and experienced by Brahmäjé.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Lord Kåñëa, and not directly Näräyaëa or the puruña-avatäras, which are subsequent manifestations. Therefore Çrémad-Bhägavatam means consciousness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Çré Kåñëa, and Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the sound representation of the Lord as much as the Bhagavad-gétä is. Thus the conclusion is that Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the science of the Lord in which the Lord and His abode are perfectly realized."
