Receiving transcendental knowledge is not like exchanging dollars; such knowledge has to be received by service to the spiritual master. As Brahmäjé received the knowledge directly from the Lord by satisfying Him fully, similarly one has to receive the transcendental knowledge from the spiritual master by satisfying him. The spiritual master's satisfaction is the means of assimilating transcendental knowledge. One cannot understand transcendental knowledge simply by becoming a grammarian. The Vedas declare (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 6.23):"

One who is now the disciple is the next spiritual master. And one cannot be a bona fide and authorized spiritual master unless one has been strictly obedient to his spiritual master. Brahmäjé, as a disciple of the Supreme Lord, received the real knowledge and imparted it to his dear disciple Närada, and similarly Närada, as spiritual master, handed over this knowledge to Vyäsa and so on. Therefore the so-called formal spiritual master and disciple are not facsimiles of Brahmä and Närada or Närada and Vyäsa. The relationship between Brahmä and Närada is reality, while the so-called formality is the relation between the cheater and cheated. It is clearly mentioned herewith that Närada is not only well behaved, meek and obedient, but also self-controlled. One who is not self-controlled, specifically in sex life, can become neither a disciple nor a spiritual master. One must have disciplinary training in controlling speaking, anger, the tongue, the mind, the belly and the genitals. One who has controlled the particular senses mentioned above is called a gosvämé. Without becoming a gosvämé one can become neither a disciple nor a spiritual master. The so-called spiritual master without sense control is certainly the cheater, and the disciple of such a so-called spiritual master is the cheated."

The inhabitants of this small planet earth can hardly calculate even the duration of one day of Brahmä."
