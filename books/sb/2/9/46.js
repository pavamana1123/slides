The answers depend only on the qualification of the person who explains them. The ten divisions of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, as explained by the great speaker Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé, are the limitation of all questions, and intelligent persons will derive all intellectual benefits from them by proper utilization."
