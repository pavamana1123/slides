            "content": "Although the Çrémad-Bhägavatam was spoken in four verses, it had ten characteristics, which will be explained in the next chapter. In the four verses it is first said that the Lord existed before the creation, and thus the beginning of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam includes the Vedänta aphorism janmädy asya . Janmädy asya is the beginning, yet the four verses in which it is said that the Lord is the root of everything that be, beginning from the creation up to the supreme abode of the Lord, naturally explain the ten characteristics. One should not misunderstand by wrong interpretations that the Lord spoke only four verses and that therefore all the rest of the 17,996 verses are useless. The ten characteristics, as will be explained in the next chapter, require so many verses just to explain them properly. Brahmäjé had also advised Närada previously that he should expand the idea he had heard from Brahmäjé. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu instructed this to Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in a nutshell, but the disciple Rüpa Gosvämé expanded this very elaborately, and the same subject was further expanded by Jéva Gosvämé and even further by Çré Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura. We are just trying to follow in the footsteps of all these authorities. So Çrémad-Bhägavatam is not like ordinary fiction or mundane literature. It is unlimited in strength, and however one may expand it according to one's own ability, Bhägavatam still cannot be finished by such expansion. Çrémad-Bhägavatam, being the sound representation of the Lord, is simultaneously explained in four verses and in four billion verses all the same, inasmuch as the Lord is smaller than the atom and bigger than the unlimited sky. Such is the potency of Çrémad-Bhägavatam."
