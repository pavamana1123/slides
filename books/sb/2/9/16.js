In that yoga-péöha, the personifications of religion, knowledge, opulence and renunciation are all seated at the lotus feet of the Lord. The four Vedas, namely Åk, Säma, Yajur and Atharva, are present there personally to advise the Lord. The sixteen energies headed by Caëòa are all present there. Caëòa and Kumuda are the first two doorkeepers, at the middle door are the doorkeepers named Bhadra and Subhadra, and at the last door are Jaya and Vijaya. There are other doorkeepers also, named Kumuda, Kumudäkña, Puëòaréka, Vämana, Çaìkukarëa, Sarvanetra, Sumukha, etc. The Lord's palace is well decorated and protected by the above-mentioned doorkeepers."
