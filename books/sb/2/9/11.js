    "translation": "The inhabitants of the Vaikuëöha planets are described as having a glowing sky-bluish complexion. Their eyes resemble lotus flowers, their dress is of yellowish color, and their bodily features very attractive. They are just the age of growing youths, they all have four hands, they are all nicely decorated with pearl necklaces with ornamental medallions, and they all appear to be effulgent.",

We can find the descriptions in the revealed scriptures like Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Impersonal descriptions of transcendence in the scriptures indicate that the bodily features in Vaikuëöhaloka are never to be seen in any part of the universe. As there are different bodily features in different places of a particular planet, or as there are different bodily features between bodies in different planets, similarly the bodily features of the inhabitants in Vaikuëöhaloka are completely different from those in the material universe. For example, the four hands are distinct from the two hands in this world."
