            "content": "Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, after placing Mahäräja Parékñit on the imperial throne of Hastinäpura, and after posting Vajra, the great-grandson of Lord Kåñëa, as the King of Mathurä, accepted the renounced order of life. The system of four orders of life and four castes in terms of quality and work, known as varëäçrama-dharma, is the beginning of real human life, and Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, as the protector of this system of human activities, timely retired from active life as a sannyäsé, handing over the charge of the administration to a trained prince, Mahäräja Parékñit. The scientific system of varëäçrama-dharma divides the human life into four divisions of occupation and four orders of life. The four orders of life as brahmacäré, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsé are to be followed by all, irrespective of the occupational division. Modern politicians do not wish to retire from active life, even if they are old enough, but Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja, as an ideal king, voluntarily retired from active administrative life to prepare himself for the next life. Everyone's life must be so arranged that the last stage of life, say at least the last fifteen to twenty years prior to death, can be absolutely devoted to the devotional service of the Lord to attain the highest perfection of life. It is really foolishness to engage oneself all the days of one's life in material enjoyment and fruitive activities, because as long as the mind remains absorbed in fruitive work for material enjoyment, there is no chance of getting out from conditioned life, or material bondage. No one should follow the suicidal policy of neglecting one's supreme task of attaining the highest perfection of life, namely going back home, back to Godhead."
