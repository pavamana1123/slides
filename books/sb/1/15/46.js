The Päëòavas, not only in this life but also in their previous lives, had always performed the supreme pious work, and thus they are ever free from all the reactions of impious work. It is quite reasonable, therefore, that they concentrated their minds upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa. According to Çré Viçvanätha Cakravarté, dharma, artha, käma and mokña principles are accepted by persons who are not free from the results of impious action. Such persons affected with the contaminations of the above four principles cannot at once accept the lotus feet of the Lord in the spiritual sky. The Vaikuëöha world is situated far beyond the material sky. The material sky is under the management of Durgä Devé, or the material energy of the Lord, but the Vaikuëöha world is managed by the personal energy of the Lord."
