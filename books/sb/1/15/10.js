    "translation": "It was He only who loosened the hair of all the wives of the miscreants who dared open the cluster of your Queen's hair, which had been nicely dressed and sanctified for the great Räjasüya sacrificial ceremony. At that time she fell down at the feet of Lord Kåñëa with tears in her eyes.",

But when she was lost in a bet, Duùçäsana touched her glorified hair to insult her. Draupadé then fell down at the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa, and Lord Kåñëa decided that all the wives of Duùçäsana and company should have their hair loosened as a result of the Battle of Kurukñetra. Thus after the Battle of Kurukñetra, after all the sons and grandsons of Dhåtaräñöra died in battle, all the wives of the family were obliged to loosen their hair as widows. In other words, all the wives of the Kuru family became widows because of Duùçäsana's insulting a great devotee of the Lord. The Lord can tolerate insults upon Himself by any miscreant because the father tolerates even insults from the son. But He never tolerates insults upon His devotees. By insulting a great soul, one has to forego all the results of pious acts and benedictions also."
