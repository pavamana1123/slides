            "content": "The younger brothers of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira were already obedient followers of the great Emperor, and they had sufficiently been trained to know the ultimate goal of life. They therefore decidedly followed their eldest brother in rendering devotional service to Lord Çré Kåñëa. According to the principles of sanätana-dharma, one must retire from family life after half the duration of life is finished and must engage himself in self-realization. But the question of engaging oneself is not always decided. Sometimes retired men are bewildered about how to engage themselves for the last days of life. Here is a decision by authorities like the Päëòavas. All of them engaged themselves in favorably culturing the devotional service of the Lord Çré Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Svämé Çrédhara, dharma, artha, käma and mokña, or fruitive activities, philosophical speculations and salvation, as conceived by several persons, are not the ultimate goal of life. They are more or less practiced by persons who have no information of the ultimate goal of life. The ultimate goal of life is already indicated by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gétä , and the Päëòavas were intelligent enough to follow it without hesitation."
