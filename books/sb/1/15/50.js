    "translation": "Draupadé also saw that her husbands, without caring for her, were leaving home. She knew well about Lord Väsudeva, Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead. Both she and Subhadrä became absorbed in thoughts of Kåñëa and attained the same results as their husbands.",

            "content": "When flying an airplane, one cannot take care of other planes. Everyone has to take care of his own plane, and if there is any danger, no other plane can help another in that condition. Similarly, at the end of life, when one has to go back home, back to Godhead, everyone has to take care of himself without help rendered by another. The help is, however, offered on the ground before flying in space. Similarly, the spiritual master, the father, the mother, the relatives, the husband and others can all render help during one's lifetime, but while crossing the sea one has to take care of himself and utilize the instructions formerly received. Draupadé had five husbands, and no one asked Draupadé to come; Draupadé had to take care of herself without waiting for her great husbands. And because she was already trained, she at once took to concentration upon the lotus feet of Lord Väsudeva, Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead. The wives also got the same result as their husbands, in the same manner; that is to say, without changing their bodies they reached the destination of Godhead. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura suggests that both Draupadé and Subhadrä, although her name is not mentioned herein, got the same result. None of them had to quit the body."
