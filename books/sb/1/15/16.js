Prahläda Mahäräja, a small child of only five years, became the object of envy for his great father, Hiraëyakaçipu, only because of his becoming a pure devotee of the Lord. The demon father employed all his weapons to kill the devotee son, Prahläda, but by the grace of the Lord he was saved from all sorts of dangerous actions by his father. He was thrown in a fire, in boiling oil, from the top of a hill, underneath the legs of an elephant, and he was administered poison. At last the father himself took up a chopper to kill his son, and thus Nåsiàhadeva appeared and killed the heinous father in the presence of the son. Thus no one can kill the devotee of the Lord. Similarly, Arjuna was also saved by the Lord, although all dangerous weapons were employed by his great opponents like Bhéñma."

            "content": "Karëa: Born of Kunté by the sun-god prior to her marriage with Mahäräja Päëòu, Karëa took his birth with bangles and earrings, extraordinary signs for an undaunted hero. In the beginning his name was Vasusena, but when he grew up he presented his natural bangles and earrings to Indradeva, and thenceforward he became known as Vaikartana. After his birth from the maiden Kunté, he was thrown in the Ganges. Later he was picked up by Adhiratha, and he and his wife Rädhä brought him up as their own offspring. Karëa was very charitable, especially toward the brähmaëas. There was nothing he could not spare for a brähmaëa. In the same charitable spirit he gave in charity his natural bangles and earrings to Indradeva, who, being very much satisfied with him, gave him in return a great weapon called Çakti. He was admitted as one of the students of Droëäcärya, and from the very beginning there was some rivalry between him and Arjuna. Seeing his constant rivalry with Arjuna, Duryodhana picked him up as his companion, and this gradually grew into greater intimacy. He was also present in the great assembly of Draupadé's svayaàvara function, and when he attempted to exhibit his talent in that meeting, Draupadé's brother declared that Karëa could not take part in the competition because of his being the son of a çüdra carpenter. Although he was refused in the competition, still when Arjuna was successful in piercing the fish target on the ceiling and Draupadé bestowed her garland upon Arjuna, Karëa and the other disappointed princes offered an unusual stumbling block to Arjuna while he was leaving with Draupadé. Specifically, Karëa fought with him very valiantly, but all of them were defeated by Arjuna. Duryodhana was very much pleased with Karëa because of his constant rivalry with Arjuna, and when he was in power he enthroned Karëa in the state of Aìga. Being baffled in his attempt to win Draupadé, Karëa advised Duryodhana to attack King Drupada, for after defeating him both Arjuna and Draupadé could be arrested. But Droëäcärya rebuked them for this conspiracy, and they refrained from the action. Karëa was defeated many times, not only by Arjuna but also by Bhémasena. He was the king of the kingdom of Bengal, Orissa and Madras combined. Later on he took an active part in the Räjasüya sacrifice of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, and when there was gambling between the rival brothers, designed by Çakuni, Karëa took part in the game, and he was very pleased when Draupadé was offered as a bet in the gambling. This fed his old grudge. When Draupadé was in the game he was very enthusiastic to declare the news, and it is he who ordered Duùçäsana to take away the garments of both the Päëòavas and Draupadé. He asked Draupadé to select another husband because, being lost by the Päëòavas, she was rendered a slave of the Kurus. He was always an enemy of the Päëòavas, and whenever there was an opportunity, he tried to curb them by all means. During the Battle of Kurukñetra, he foresaw the conclusive result, and he expressed his opinion that due to Lord Kåñëa's being the chariot driver of Arjuna, the battle should be won by Arjuna. He always differed with Bhéñma, and sometimes he was proud enough to say that within five days he could finish up the Päëòavas, if Bhéñma would not interfere with his plan of action. But he was much mortified when Bhéñma died. He killed Ghaöotkaca with the Çakti weapon obtained from Indradeva. His son, Våñasena, was killed by Arjuna. He killed the largest number of Päëòava soldiers. At last there was a severe fight with Arjuna, and it was he only who was able to knock off the helmet of Arjuna. But it so happened that the wheel of his chariot stuck in the battlefield mud, and when he got down to set the wheel right, Arjuna took the opportunity and killed him, although he requested Arjuna not to do so."

Both the brothers and the father attended the svayaàvara ceremony of Draupadé. All of them appreciated the wonderful strength of Arjuna due to his being the devotee friend of the Lord, and thus Bhüriçravä advised the sons of Dhåtaräñöra not to pick any quarrel or fight with them. All of them also attended the Räjasüya yajïa of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. He possessed one akñauhiëé regiment of army, cavalry, elephants and chariots, and all these were employed in the Battle of Kurukñetra on behalf of Duryodhana's party. He was counted by Bhéma as one of the yütha-patis. In the Battle of Kurukñetra he was especially engaged in a fight with Sätyaki, and he killed ten sons of Sätyaki. Later on, Arjuna cut off his hands, and he was ultimately killed by Sätyaki. After his death he merged into the existence of Viçvadeva."

            "content": "Jayadratha: Another son of Mahäräja Våddhakñetra. He was the King of Sindhudeça (modern Sindh Pakistan). His wife's name was Duùçalä. He was also present in the svayaàvara ceremony of Draupadé, and he desired very strongly to have her hand, but he failed in the competition. But since then he always sought the opportunity to get in touch with Draupadé. When he was going to marry in the Çalyadeça, on the way to Kämyavana he happened to see Draupadé again and was too much attracted to her. The Päëòavas and Draupadé were then in exile, after losing their empire in gambling, and Jayadratha thought it wise to send news to Draupadé in an illicit manner through Koöiçañya, one of his associates. Draupadé at once refused vehemently the proposal of Jayadratha, but being so much attracted by the beauty of Draupadé, he tried again and again. Every time he was refused by Draupadé. He tried to take her away forcibly on his chariot, and at first Draupadé gave him a good dashing, and he fell like a cut-root tree. But he was not discouraged, and he was able to force Draupadé to sit on the chariot. This incident was seen by Dhaumya Muni, and he strongly protested the action of Jayadratha. He also followed the chariot, and through Dhätreyikä the matter was brought to the notice of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. The Päëòavas then attacked the soldiers of Jayadratha and killed them all, and at last Bhéma caught hold of Jayadratha and beat him very severely, almost dead. Then all but five hairs were cut off his head and he was taken to all the kings and introduced as the slave of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. He was forced to admit himself to be the slave of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira before all the princely order, and in the same condition he was brought before Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was kind enough to order him released, and when he admitted to being a tributary prince under Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, Queen Draupadé also desired his release. After this incident, he was allowed to return to his country. Being so insulted, he went to Gaìgotri in the Himalayas and undertook a severe type of penance to please Lord Çiva. He asked his benediction to defeat all the Päëòavas, at least one at a time. Then the Battle of Kurukñetra began, and he took sides with Duryodhana. In the first day's fight he was engaged with Mahäräja Drupada, then with Viräöa and then with Abhimanyu. While Abhimanyu was being killed, mercilessly surrounded by seven great generals, the Päëòavas came to his help, but Jayadratha, by the mercy of Lord Çiva, repulsed them with great ability. At this, Arjuna took a vow to kill him, and on hearing this, Jayadratha wanted to leave the warfield and asked permission from the Kauravas for this cowardly action. But he was not allowed to do so. On the contrary, he was obliged to fight with Arjuna, and while the fight was going on Lord Kåñëa reminded Arjuna that the benediction of Çiva upon Jayadratha was that whoever would cause his head to fall on the ground would die at once. He therefore advised Arjuna to throw the head of Jayadratha directly onto the lap of his father, who was engaged in penances at the Samanta-païcaka pilgrimage. This was actually done by Arjuna. Jayadratha's father was surprised to see a severed head on his lap, and he at once threw it to the ground. The father immediately died, his forehead being cracked in seven pieces."
