Paramätmä is the sväàça part of the Lord, whereas the vibhinnäàça parts are the living beings. As the living being is the important factor in the material body, for without the living being the material body has no value, similarly without Paramätmä the living being has no status quo. Similarly, Brahman or Paramätmä has no locus standi without the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. This is thoroughly explained in the Bhagavad-gétä. They are all interlinked with one another, or interdependent factors; thus in the ultimate issue the Lord is the summum bonum and therefore the vital principle of everything."
