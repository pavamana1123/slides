            "content": "It is understood from this verse that Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira followed in the footsteps of his forefathers and the great devotees of the Lord. We have discussed many times before that the system of varëäçrama-dharma, as it was strictly followed by the inhabitants of the world, specifically by those who inhabited the Äryävarta province of the world, emphasizes the importance of leaving all household connections at a certain stage of life. The training and education was so imparted, and thus a respectable person like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira had to leave all family connection for self-realization and going back to Godhead. No king or respectable gentleman would continue family life till the end, because that was considered suicidal and against the interest of the perfection of human life. In order to be free from all family encumbrances and devote oneself cent percent in the devotional service of Lord Kåñëa, this system is always recommended for everyone because it is the path of authority. The Lord instructs in the Bhagavad-gétä  that one must become a devotee of the Lord at least at the last stage of one's life. A sincere soul of the Lord like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira must abide by this instruction of the Lord for his own interest."

This is corroborated in the Bhagavad-gétä  by Arjuna with reference to great authorities like Asita, Devala, Närada and Vyäsa. Thus Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, while leaving home for the north, constantly remembered Lord Çré Kåñëa within himself, following in the footsteps of his forefathers as well as the great devotees of all times."
