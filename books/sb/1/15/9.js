            "content": "Jaräsandha was a very powerful king of Magadha, and the history of his birth and activities is also very interesting. His father, King Båhadratha, was also a very prosperous and powerful king of Magadha, but he had no son, although he married two daughters of the King of Käçé. Being disappointed in not getting a son from either of the two queens, the King, along with his wives, left home to live in the forest for austerities, but in the forest he was blessed by one great åñi to have a son, and he gave him one mango to be eaten by the queens. The queens did so and were very soon pregnant. The King was very happy to see the queens bearing children, but when the ripe time approached, the queens delivered one child in two parts, one from each of the queens' wombs. The two parts were thrown in the forest, where a great she-demon used to live, and she was glad to have some delicate flesh and blood from the newly born child. Out of curiosity she joined the two parts, and the child became complete and regained life. The she-demon was known as Jarä, and being compassionate on the childless King, she went to the King and presented him with the nice child, The King was very pleased with the she-demon and wanted to reward her according to her desire. The she-demon expressed her desire that the child be named after her, and thus the child was surnamed Jaräsandha, or one who was joined by Jarä, the she-demon. In fact, this Jaräsandha was born as one of the parts and parcels of the demon Vipracitti. The saint by whose benedictions the queens bore the child was called Candra Kauçika, who foretold of the child before his father Båhadratha."

            "content": "Since he possessed demoniac qualities from birth, naturally he became a great devotee of Lord Çiva, who is the lord of all ghostly and demoniac men. Rävaëa was a great devotee of Lord Çiva, and so also King Jaräsandha. He used to sacrifice all arrested kings before Lord Mahäbhairava (Çiva) and by his military power he defeated many small kings and arrested them to butcher before Mahäbhairava. There are many devotees of Lord Mahäbhairava, or Kälabhairava, in the province of Bihar, formerly called Magadha. Jaräsandha was a relative of Kaàsa, the maternal uncle of Kåñëa, and therefore after Kaàsa's death King Jaräsandha became a great enemy of Kåñëa, and there were many fights between Jaräsandha and Kåñëa. Lord Kåñëa wanted to kill him, but He also wanted that those who served as military men for Jaräsandha might not be killed. Therefore a plan was adopted to kill him. Kåñëa, Bhéma and Arjuna together went to Jaräsandha in the dress of poor brähmaëas and begged charity from King Jaräsandha. Jaräsandha never refused charity to any brähmaëa, and he performed many sacrifices also, yet he was not on a par with devotional service. Lord Kåñëa, Bhéma and Arjuna asked Jaräsandha for the facility of fighting him, and it was settled that Jaräsandha would fight with Bhéma only. So all of them were both guests and combatants of Jaräsandha, and Bhéma and Jaräsandha fought every day for several days. Bhéma became disappointed, but Kåñëa gave him hints about Jaräsandha's being joined together as an infant, and thus Bhéma dissected him again and so killed him. All the kings who were detained in the concentration camp to be killed before Mahäbhairava were thus released by Bhéma. Feeling thus obliged to the Päëòavas, they paid tribute to King Yudhiñöhira."
