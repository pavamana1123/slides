    "translation": "Thus by pure consciousness due to constant devotional remembrance, they attained the spiritual sky, which is ruled over by the Supreme Näräyaëa, Lord Kåñëa. This is attained only by those who meditate upon the one Supreme Lord without deviation. This abode of the Lord Çré Kåñëa, known as Goloka Våndävana, cannot be attained by persons who are absorbed in the material conception of life. But the Päëòavas, being completely washed of all material contamination, attained that abode in their very same bodies.",

            "content": "According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, a person freed from the three modes of material qualities, namely goodness, passion and ignorance, and situated in transcendence can reach the highest perfection of life without change of body. Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé in his Hari-bhakti-viläsa says that a person, whatever he may be, can attain the perfection of a twice-born brähmaëa by undergoing the spiritual disciplinary actions under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, exactly as a chemist can turn gun metal into gold by chemical manipulation. It is therefore the actual guidance that matters in the process of becoming a brähmaëa, even without change of body, or in going back to Godhead without change of body. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé remarks that the word hi used in this connection positively affirms this truth, and there is no doubt about this factual position. The Bhagavad-gétä  also affirms this statement of Çréla Jéva Gosvämé when the Lord says that anyone who executes devotional service systematically without deviation can attain the perfection of Brahman by surpassing the contamination of the three modes of material nature, and when the Brahman perfection is still more advanced by the selfsame execution of devotional service, there is no doubt at all that one can attain the supreme spiritual planet, Goloka Våndävana, without change of body, as we have already discussed in connection with the Lord's returning to His abode without a change of body."
