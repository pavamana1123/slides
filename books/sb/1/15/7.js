            "content": "Draupadé was the most beautiful daughter of King Drupada, and when she was a young girl almost all the princes desired her hand. But Drupada Mahäräja decided to hand over his daughter to Arjuna only and therefore contrived a peculiar way. There was a fish hanging on the inner roof of the house under the protection of a wheel. The condition was that out of the princely order, one must be able to pierce the fish's eyes through the wheel of protection, and no one would be allowed to look up at the target. On the ground there was a waterpot in which the target and wheel were reflected, and one had to fix his aim towards the target by looking at the trembling water in the pot. Mahäräja Drupada well knew that only Arjuna or alternately Karëa could successfully carry out the plan. But still he wanted to hand his daughter to Arjuna. And in the assembly of the princely order, when Dhåñöadyumna, the brother of Draupadé, introduced all the princes to his grown-up sister, Karëa was also present in the game. But Draupadé tactfully avoided Karëa as the rival of Arjuna, and she expressed her desires through her brother Dhåñöadyumna that she was unable to accept anyone who was less than a kñatriya. The vaiçyas and the çüdras are less important than the kñatriyas. Karëa was known as the son of a carpenter, a çüdra. So Draupadé avoided Karëa by this plea. When Arjuna, in the dress of a poor brähmaëa, pierced the difficult target, everyone was astonished, and all of them, especially Karëa, offered a stiff fight to Arjuna, but as usual by the grace of Lord Kåñëa he was able to emerge very successful in the princely fight and thus gain the valuable hand of Kåñëä, or Draupadé. Arjuna was lamentingly remembering the incident in the absence of the Lord, by whose strength only he was so powerful."
