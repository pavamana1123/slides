When he went away to take up the renounced order of life [sannyäsa], leaving home without undergoing reformation by the sacred thread or the ceremonies observed by the higher castes, his father, Vyäsadeva, fearing separation from him, cried out, \"O my son!\" Indeed, only the trees, which were absorbed in the same feelings of separation, echoed in response to the begrieved father.",

Such duties enjoin that a candidate willing to study the Vedas must approach a bona fide spiritual master and request acceptance as his disciple. The sacred thread is the sign of those who are competent to study the Vedas from the äcärya, or the bona fide spiritual master. Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé did not undergo such purificatory ceremonies because he was a liberated soul from his very birth."

            "content": "Generally, a man is born as an ordinary being, and by the purificatory processes he is born for the second time. When he sees a new light and seeks direction for spiritual progress, he approaches a spiritual master for instruction in the Vedas. The spiritual master accepts only the sincere inquirer as his disciple and gives him the sacred thread. In this way a man becomes twice-born, or a dvija. After qualifying as a dvija one may study the Vedas, and after becoming well versed in the Vedas one becomes a vipra. A vipra, or a qualified brähmaëa, thus realizes the Absolute and makes further progress in spiritual life until he reaches the Vaiñëava stage. The Vaiñëava stage is the postgraduate status of a brähmaëa. A progressive brähmaëa must necessarily become a Vaiñëava, for a Vaiñëava is a self-realized, learned brähmaëa."

            "content": "Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé was a Vaiñëava from the beginning; therefore, there was no need for him to undergo all the processes of the varëäçrama institution. Ultimately the aim of varëäçrama-dharma is to turn a crude man into a pure devotee of the Lord, or a Vaiñëava. Anyone, therefore, who becomes a Vaiñëava accepted by the first-class Vaiñëava, or uttama-adhikäré Vaiñëava, is already considered a brähmaëa, regardless of his birth or past deeds. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu accepted this principle and recognized Çréla Haridäsa Öhäkura as the äcärya of the holy name, although Öhäkura Haridäsa appeared in a Mohammedan family. In conclusion, Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé was born a Vaiñëava, and, therefore, brahminism was included in him. He did not have to undergo any ceremonies. Any lowborn person—be he a Kiräta, Hüëa, Ändhra, Pulinda, Pulkaça, Äbhéra, Çumbha, Yavana, Khasa or even lower—can be delivered to the highest transcendental position by the mercy of Vaiñëavas. Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé was the spiritual master of Çré Süta Gosvämé, who therefore offers his respectful obeisances unto Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé before he begins his answers to the questions of the sages at Naimiñäraëya."
