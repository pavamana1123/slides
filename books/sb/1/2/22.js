Lord Çré Kåñëa is the svayaà-rüpa Personality of Godhead, and all other forms of Godhead, beginning from Çré Baladeva, Saìkarñaëa, Väsudeva, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Näräyaëa and extending to the puruña-avatäras, guëa-avatäras, lélä-avatäras, yuga-avatäras and many other thousands of manifestations of the Personality of Godhead, are Lord Çré Kåñëa's plenary portions and integrated parts. The living entities are separated parts and parcels of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore Lord Sri Kåñëa is the original form of Godhead, and He is the last word in the Transcendence. Thus He is more attractive to the higher transcendentalists who participate in the eternal pastimes of the Lord. In forms of the Personality of Godhead other than Çré Kåñëa and Baladeva, there is no facility for intimate personal contact as in the transcendental pastimes of the Lord at Vrajabhümi. The transcendental pastimes of Lord Çré Kåñëa are not newly accepted, as argued by some less intelligent persons; His pastimes are eternal and are manifested in due course once in a day of Brahmäjé, as the sun rises on the eastern horizon at the end of every twenty-four hours."
