In Bhagavad-gétä  the Personality of Godhead says that in all the Vedas there is nothing but the urge for searching after Him, Lord Kåñëa. Thus the questions that pertain to Kåñëa are the sum and substance of all the Vedic inquiries."

In the morning the birds in the nest become busy with questions and answers, and in the evening also the same birds come back and again become busy with questions and answers. The human being, unless he is fast asleep at night, is busy with questions and answers. The businessmen in the market are busy with questions and answers, and so also the lawyers in the court and the students in the schools and colleges. The legislators in the parliament are also busy with questions and answers, and the politicians and the press representatives are all busy with questions and answers. Although they go on making such questions and answers for their whole lives, they are not at all satisfied. Satisfaction of the soul can only be obtained by questions and answers on the subject of Kåñëa."

Forgetting Kåñëa, we have created so many objects of questions and answers, but none of them are able to give us complete satisfaction. All things—but Kåñëa—give temporary satisfaction only, so if we are to have complete satisfaction we must take to the questions and answers about Kåñëa. We cannot live for a moment without being questioned or without giving answers. Because the Çrémad-Bhägavatam deals with questions and answers that are related to Kåñëa, we can derive the highest satisfaction only by reading and hearing this transcendental literature. One should learn the Çrémad-Bhägavatam and make an all-around solution to all problems pertaining to social, political or religious matters. Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Kåñëa are the sum total of all things."
