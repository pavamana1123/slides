The separated parts and parcels are the servitors, and the integrated plenary portions of viñëu-tattvas are the worshipful objects of service."

The viñëu-tattvas are living beings equally as powerful as the original form of the Personality of Godhead, and They display different categories of power in consideration of different times and circumstances. The separated parts and parcels are powerful by limitation. They do not have unlimited power like the viñëu-tattvas. Therefore, one should never classify the viñëu-tattvas, or the plenary portions of Näräyaëa, the Personality of Godhead, in the same categories with the parts and parcels. If anyone does so he becomes at once an offender by the name päñaëòé. In the age of Kali many foolish persons commit such unlawful offenses and equalize the two categories."

These demigods are worshiped mostly by those who are in the lowest categories of the mode of darkness or ignorance. Other demigods, like Brahmä, Çiva, Sürya, Gaëeça and many similar deities, are worshiped by men in the mode of passion, urged on by the desire for material enjoyment. But those who are actually situated in the mode of goodness (sattva-guëa) of material nature worship only viñëu-tattvas. Viñëu-tattvas are represented by various names and forms, such as Näräyaëa, Dämodara, Vämana, Govinda and Adhokñaja."

They have all respect for other demigods, even though they may look ghastly, like Käla-bhairava or Mahäkälé. They know very well that those horrible features of the Supreme Lord are all different servitors of the Lord under different conditions, yet they reject the worship of both horrible and attractive features of the demigods, and they concentrate only on the forms of Viñëu because they are serious about liberation from the material conditions. The demigods, even to the stage of Brahmä, the supreme of all the demigods, cannot offer liberation to anyone. Hiraëyakaçipu underwent a severe type of penance to become eternal in life, but his worshipful deity, Brahmä, could not satisfy him with such blessings. Therefore Viñëu, and none else, is called mukti-päda, or the Personality of Godhead who can bestow upon us mukti, liberation. The demigods, being like other living entities in the material world, are all liquidated at the time of the annihilation of the material structure. They are themselves unable to get liberation, and what to speak of giving liberation to their devotees. The demigods can award the worshipers some temporary benefit only, and not the ultimate one."
