Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the natural supplementary commentary on the Vedänta-sütras. The Vedänta-sütras, or the Brahma-sütras, were compiled by Vyäsadeva with a view to presenting just the cream of Vedic knowledge. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the natural commentary on this cream. Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé was a thoroughly realized master of the Vedänta-sütra, and consequently he also personally realized the commentary, Çrémad-Bhägavatam. And just to show his boundless mercy upon bewildered materialistic men who want to cross completely over nescience, he recited for the first time this confidential knowledge."

            "content": "There is no point in arguing that a materialistic man can be happy. No materialistic creature—be he the great Brahmä or an insignificant ant—can be happy. Everyone tries to make a permanent plan for happiness, but everyone is baffled by the laws of material nature. Therefore the materialistic world is called the darkest region of God's creation. Yet the unhappy materialists can get out of it simply by desiring to get out. Unfortunately they are so foolish that they do not want to escape. Therefore they are compared to the camel who relishes thorny twigs because he likes the taste of the twigs mixed with blood. He does not realize that it is his own blood and that his tongue is being cut by the thorns. Similarly, to the materialist his own blood is as sweet as honey, and although he is always harassed by his own material creations, he does not wish to escape. Such materialists are called karmés. Out of hundreds of thousands of karmés, only a few may feel tired of material engagement and desire to get out of the labyrinth. Such intelligent persons are called jïänés. The Vedänta-sütra is directed to such jïänés. But Çréla Vyäsadeva, being the incarnation of the Supreme Lord, could foresee the misuse of the Vedänta-sütra by unscrupulous men, and, therefore, he personally supplemented the Vedänta-sütra with the Bhägavata Puräëa. It is clearly said that this Bhägavatam is the original commentary on the Brahma-sütras. Çréla Vyäsadeva also instructed the Bhägavatam to his own son, Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé, who was already at the liberated stage of transcendence. Çréla Çukadeva realized it personally and then explained it. By the mercy of Çréla Çukadeva, the Bhägavata-vedänta-sütra is available for all those sincere souls who want to get out of material existence."

            "content": "Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the one unrivaled commentary on Vedänta-sütra. Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya intentionally did not touch it because he knew that the natural commentary would be difficult for him to surpass. He wrote his Çäréraka-bhäñya, and his so-called followers deprecated the Bhägavatam as some \"new\" presentation. One should not be misled by such propaganda directed against the Bhägavatam by the Mäyäväda school. From this introductory çloka, the beginning student should know that Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the only transcendental literature meant for those who are paramahaàsas and completely freed from the material disease called malice. The Mäyävädés are envious of the Personality of Godhead despite Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya's admission that Näräyaëa, the Personality of Godhead, is above the material creation. The envious Mäyävädé cannot have access to the Bhägavatam, but those who are really anxious to get out of this material existence may take shelter of this Bhägavatam because it is uttered by the liberated Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé. It is the transcendental torchlight by which one can see perfectly the transcendental Absolute Truth realized as Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän."
