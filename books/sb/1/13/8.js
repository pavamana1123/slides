            "content": "Due to Päëòu's death at an early age, his minor children and widow were the object of special care by all the elderly members of the family, especially Bhéñmadeva and Mahätmä Vidura. Vidura was more or less partial to the Päëòavas due to their political position. Although Dhåtaräñöra was equally careful for the minor children of Mahäräja Päëòu, he was one of the intriguing parties who wanted to wash away the descendants of Päëòu and replace them by raising his own sons to become the rulers of the kingdom. Mahätmä Vidura could follow this intrigue of Dhåtaräñöra and company, and therefore, even though he was a faithful servitor of his eldest brother, Dhåtaräñöra, he did not like his political ambition for the sake of his own sons. He was therefore very careful about the protection of the Päëòavas and their widow mother. Thus he was, so to speak, partial to the Päëòavas, preferring them to the sons of Dhåtaräñöra, although both of them were equally affectionate in his ordinary eyes. He was equally affectionate to both the camps of nephews in the sense that he always chastised Duryodhana for his intriguing policy against his cousins. He always criticized his elder brother for his policy of encouragement to his sons, and at the same time he was always alert in giving special protection to the Päëòavas. All these different activities of Vidura within the palace politics made him well-known as partial to the Päëòavas. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira has referred to the past history of Vidura before his going away from home for a prolonged pilgrim's journey. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira reminded him that he was equally kind and partial to his grown-up nephews, even after the Battle of Kurukñetra, a great family disaster."

            "content": "Before the Battle of Kurukñetra, Dhåtaräñöra's policy was peaceful annihilation of his nephews, and therefore he ordered Purocana to build a house at Väraëävata, and when the building was finished Dhåtaräñöra desired that his brother's family live there for some time. When the Päëòavas were going there in the presence of all the members of the royal family, Vidura tactfully gave instructions to the Päëòavas about the future plan of Dhåtaräñöra. This is specifically described in the Mahäbhärata (Adi-parva 114). He indirectly hinted, \"A weapon not made of steel or any other material element can be more than sharp to kill an enemy, and he who knows this is never killed.\" That is to say, he hinted that the party of the Päëòavas was being sent to Väraëävata to be killed, and thus he warned Yudhiñöhira to be very careful in their new residential palace. He also gave indications of fire and said that fire cannot extinguish the soul but can annihilate the material body. But one who protects the soul can live. Kunté could not follow such indirect conversations between Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and Vidura, and thus when she inquired from her son about the purport of the conversation, Yudhiñöhira replied that from the talks of Vidura it was understood that there was a hint of fire in the house where they were proceeding. Later on, Vidura came in disguise to the Päëòavas and informed them that the housekeeper was going to set fire to the house on the fourteenth night of the waning moon. It was an intrigue of Dhåtaräñöra that the Päëòavas might die all together with their mother. And by his warning the Päëòavas escaped through a tunnel underneath the earth so that their escape was also unknown to Dhåtaräñöra, so much so that after setting the fire, the Kauravas were so certain of the death of the Päëòavas that Dhåtaräñöra performed the last rites of death with great cheerfulness. And during the mourning period all the members of the palace became overwhelmed with lamentation, but Vidura did not become so, because of his knowledge that the Päëòavas were alive somewhere. There are many such instances of calamities, and in each of them Vidura gave protection to the Päëòavas on one hand, and on the other he tried to restrain his brother Dhåtaräñöra from such intriguing policies. Therefore, he was always partial to the Päëòavas, just as a bird protects its eggs by its wing."
