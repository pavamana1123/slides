            "content": "Cruel death cares for no one, be he Dhåtaräñöra or even Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira; therefore spiritual instruction, as was given to old Dhåtaräñöra, was equally applicable to younger Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. As a matter of fact, everyone in the royal palace, including the King and his brothers and mother, was raptly attending the lectures. But it was known to Vidura that his instructions were especially meant for Dhåtaräñöra, who was too materialistic. The word räjan is especially addressed to Dhåtaräñöra significantly. Dhåtaräñöra was the eldest son of his father, and therefore according to law he was to be installed on the throne of Hastinäpura. But because he was blind from birth, he was disqualified from his rightful claim. But he could not forget the bereavement, and his disappointment was somewhat compensated after the death of Päëòu, his younger brother. His younger brother left behind him some minor children, and Dhåtaräñöra became the natural guardian of them, but at heart he wanted to become the factual king and hand the kingdom over to his own sons, headed by Duryodhana. With all these imperial ambitions, Dhåtaräñöra wanted to become a king, and he contrived all sorts of intrigues in consultation with his brother-in-law Çakuni. But everything failed by the will of the Lord, and at the last stage, even after losing everything, men and money, he wanted to remain as king, being the eldest uncle of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, as a matter of duty, maintained Dhåtaräñöra in royal honor, and Dhåtaräñöra was happily passing away his numbered days in the illusion of being a king or the royal uncle of King Yudhiñöhira. Vidura, as a saint and as the duty-bound affectionate youngest brother of Dhåtaräñöra, wanted to awaken Dhåtaräñöra from his slumber of disease and old age. Vidura therefore sarcastically addressed Dhåtaräñöra as the \"King,\" which he was actually not. Everyone is the servant of eternal time, and therefore no one can be king in this material world. King means the person who can order. The celebrated English king wanted to order time and tide, but the time and tide refused to obey his order. Therefore one is a false king in the material world, and Dhåtaräñöra was particularly reminded of this false position and of the factual fearful happenings which had already approached him at that time. Vidura asked him to get out immediately, if he wanted to be saved from the fearful situation which was approaching him fast. He did not ask Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira in that way because he knew that a king like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira is aware of all the fearful situations of this flimsy world and would take care of himself, in due course, even though Vidura might not be present at that time."
