    "translation": "Where is my well-wisher, uncle Vidura, and mother Gändhäré, who is very afflicted due to all her sons' demise? My uncle Dhåtaräñöra was also very mortified due to the death of all his sons and grandsons. Undoubtedly I am very ungrateful. Did he, therefore, take my offenses very seriously and, along with his wife, drown himself in the Ganges?",

The fight was executed by the will of the Lord, but the effects of family aggrievement, as they had thought of it before, had come to be true. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was always conscious of the great plight of his uncle Dhåtaräñöra and aunt Gändhäré, and therefore he took all possible care of them in their old age and aggrieved conditions. When, therefore, he could not find his uncle and aunt in the palace, naturally his doubts arose, and he conjectured that they had gone down to the water of the Ganges. He thought himself ungrateful because when the Päëòavas were fatherless, Mahäräja Dhåtaräñöra had given them all royal facilities to live, and in return he had killed all Dhåtaräñöra's sons in the Battle of Kurukñetra. As a pious man, Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira took into account all his unavoidable misdeeds, and he never thought of the misdeeds of his uncle and company. Dhåtaräñöra had suffered the effects of his own misdeeds by the will of the Lord, but Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was thinking only of his own unavoidable misdeeds. That is the nature of a good man and devotee of the Lord. A devotee never finds fault with others, but tries to find his own and thus rectify them as far as possible."
