He can travel in the outer spaces of both the material and spiritual worlds without restriction and can approach any planet in unlimited space within no time. We have already discussed his previous life as the son of a maidservant. Because of his association with pure devotees, he was elevated to the position of an eternal spaceman and thus had freedom of movement. One should therefore try to follow in the footsteps of Närada Muni and not make a futile effort to reach other planets by mechanical means. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was a pious king, and therefore he could see Närada Muni occasionally; anyone who desires to see Närada Muni must first be pious and follow in the footsteps of Närada Muni."
