            "content": "The King is reminded of his precarious condition, influenced by cruel time, and by his past experience he should have been more intelligent to see what was going to happen to his own life. His father, Vicitravérya, died long ago, when he and his younger brothers were all little children, and it was due to the care and kindness of Bhéñmadeva that they were properly brought up. Then again his brother Päëòu died also. Then in the Battlefield of Kurukñetra his one hundred sons and his grandsons all died, along with all other well-wishers like Bhéñmadeva, Droëäcärya, Karëa and many other kings and friends. So he had lost all men and money, and now he was living at the mercy of his nephew, whom he had put into troubles of various types. And despite all these reverses, he thought that he would prolong his life more and more. Vidura wanted to point out to Dhåtaräñöra that everyone has to protect himself by his action and the grace of the Lord. One has to execute his duty faithfully, depending for the result on the supreme authority. No friend, no children, no father, no brother, no state and no one else can protect a person who is not protected by the Supreme Lord. One should, therefore, seek the protection of the Supreme Lord, for the human form of life is meant for seeking that protection. He was warned of his precarious conditions more and more by the following words."
