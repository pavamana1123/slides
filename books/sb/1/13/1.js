            "content": "Vidura: One of the prominent figures in the history of the Mahäbhärata. He was conceived by Vyäsadeva in the womb of the maidservant of Ambikä, mother of Mahäräja Päëòu. He is the incarnation of Yamaräja. Being cursed by Maëòüka Muni, he was to become a çüdra. The story is narrated as follows. Once upon a time the state police caught some thieves who had concealed themselves in the hermitage of Maëòüka Muni. The police constables, as usual, arrested all the thieves and Maëòüka Muni along with them. The magistrate specifically punished the muni to death by being pierced with a lance. When he was just to be pierced, the news reached the king, and he at once stopped the act on consideration of his being a great muni. The king personally begged the muni's pardon for the mistake of his men, and the saint at once went to Yamaräja, who prescribes the destiny of the living beings. Yamaräja, being questioned by the muni, replied that the muni in his childhood pierced an ant with a sharpened straw, and for that reason he was put into difficulty. The muni thought it unwise on the part of Yamaräja that he was punished for his childish innocence, and thus the muni cursed Yamaräja to become a çüdra, and this çüdra incarnation of Yamaräja was known as Vidura, the çüdra brother of Dhåtaräñöra and Mahäräja Päëòu. But this çüdra son of the Kuru dynasty was equally treated by Bhéñmadeva, along with his other nephews, and in due course Vidura was married with a girl who was also born in the womb of a çüdräëé by a brähmaëa. Although Vidura did not inherit the property of his father (the brother of Bhéñmadeva), still he was given sufficient state property by Dhåtaräñöra, the elder brother of Vidura. Vidura was very much attached to his elder brother, and all along he tried to guide him on the right path. During the fratricidal war of Kurukñetra, Vidura repeatedly implored his elder brother to do justice to the sons of Päëòu, but Duryodhana did not like such interference by his uncle, and thus he practically insulted Vidura. This resulted in Vidura's leaving home for pilgrimage and taking instructions from Maitreya."
