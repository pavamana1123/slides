            "content": "That great souls cheat others may be astonishing to know, but it is a fact that great souls cheat others for a great cause. It is said that Lord Kåñëa also advised Yudhiñöhira to tell a lie before Droëäcärya, and it was also for a great cause. The Lord wanted it, and therefore it was a great cause. Satisfaction of the Lord is the criterion of one who is bona fide, and the highest perfection of life is to satisfy the Lord by one's occupational duty. That is the verdict of Gétä and Bhägavatam.* Dhåtaräñöra and Vidura, followed by Gändhäré, did not disclose their determination to Saïjaya, although he was constantly with Dhåtaräñöra as his personal assistant. Saïjaya never thought that Dhåtaräñöra could perform any act without consulting him. But Dhåtaräñöra's going away from home was so confidential that it could not be disclosed even to Saïjaya. Sanätana Gosvämé also cheated the keeper of the prison house while going away to see Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, and similarly Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé also cheated his priest and left home for good to satisfy the Lord. To satisfy the Lord, anything is good, for it is in relation with the Absolute Truth. We also had the same opportunity to cheat the family members and leave home to engage in the service of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Such cheating was necessary for a great cause, and there is no loss for any party in such transcendental fraud."
