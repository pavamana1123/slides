She was the daughter of Mahäräja Subala, the King of Gändhära (now Kandahar in Kabul), and in her maiden state she worshiped Lord Çiva. Lord Çiva is generally worshiped by Hindu maidens to get a good husband. Gändhäré satisfied Lord Çiva, and by his benediction to obtain one hundred sons, she was betrothed to Dhåtaräñöra, despite his being blind forever. When Gändhäré came to know that her would-be husband was a blind man, to follow her life companion she decided to become voluntarily blind. So she wrapped up her eyes with many silk linens, and she was married to Dhåtaräñöra under the guidance of her elder brother Çakuni. She was the most beautiful girl of her time, and she was equally qualified by her womanly qualities, which endeared every member of the Kaurava court. But despite all her good qualities, she had the natural frailties of a woman, and she was envious of Kunté when the latter gave birth to a male child. Both the queens were pregnant, but Kunté first gave birth to a male child. Thus Gändhäré became angry and gave a blow to her own abdomen. As a result, she gave birth to a lump of flesh only, but since she was a devotee of Vyäsadeva, by the instruction of Vyäsadeva the lump was divided into one hundred parts, and each part gradually developed to become a male child. Thus her ambition to become the mother of one hundred sons was fulfilled, and she began to nourish all the children according to her exalted position. When the intrigue of the Battle of Kurukñetra was going on, she was not in favor of fighting with the Päëòavas; rather, she blamed Dhåtaräñöra, her husband, for such a fratricidal war. She desired that the state be divided into two parts, for the sons of Päëòu and her own. She was very affected when all her sons died in the Battle of Kurukñetra, and she wanted to curse Bhémasena and Yudhiñöhira, but she was checked by Vyäsadeva. Her mourning over the death of Duryodhana and Duùçäsana before Lord Kåñëa was very pitiful, and Lord Kåñëa pacified her by transcendental messages. She was equally aggrieved on the death of Karëa, and she described to Lord Kåñëa the lamentation of Karëa's wife. She was pacified by Çréla Vyäsadeva when he showed her dead sons, then promoted to the heavenly kingdoms. She died along with her husband in the jungles of the Himalayas near the mouth of the Ganges; she burned in a forest fire. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira performed the death ceremony of his uncle and aunt."

            "content": "Påthä: Daughter of Mahäräja Çürasena and sister of Vasudeva, Lord Kåñëa's father. Later she was adopted by Mahäräja Kuntibhoja, and hence she is known as Kunté. She is the incarnation of the success potency of the Personality of Godhead. The heavenly denizens from the upper planets used to visit the palace of King Kuntibhoja, and Kunté was engaged for their reception. She also served the great mystic sage Durväsä, and being satisfied by her faithful service, Durväsä Muni gave her a mantra by which it was possible for her to call for any demigod she pleased. As a matter of inquisitiveness, she at once called for the sun-god, who desired couplement with her, but she declined. But the sun-god assured her immunity from virgin adulteration, and so she agreed to his proposal. As a result of this couplement, she became pregnant, and Karëa was born by her. By the grace of the sun, she again turned into a virgin girl, but being afraid of her parents, she quitted the newly born child, Karëa. After that, when she actually selected her own husband, she preferred Päëòu to be her husband. Mahäräja Päëòu later wanted to retire from family life and adopt the renounced order of life. Kunté refused to allow her husband to adopt such life, but at last Mahäräja Päëòu gave her permission to become a mother of sons by calling some other suitable personalities. Kunté did not accept this proposal at first, but when vivid examples were set by Päëòu she agreed. Thus by dint of the mantra awarded by Durväsä Muni she called for Dharmaräja, and thus Yudhiñöhira was born. She called for the demigod Väyu (air), and thus Bhéma was born. She called for Indra, the King of heaven, and thus Arjuna was born. The other two sons, namely Nakula and Sahadeva, were begotten by Päëòu himself in the womb of Mädré. Later on, Mahäräja Päëòu died at an early age, for which Kunté was so aggrieved that she fainted. Two co-wives, namely Kunté and Mädré, decided that Kunté should live for the maintenance of the five minor children, the Päëòavas, and Mädré should accept the saté rituals by meeting voluntary death along with her husband. This agreement was endorsed by great sages like Çataçåìga and others present on the occasion."

            "content": "Later on, when the Päëòavas were banished from the kingdom by the intrigues of Duryodhana, Kunté followed her sons, and she equally faced all sorts of difficulties during those days. During the forest life one demon girl, Hiòimbä, wanted Bhéma as her husband. Bhéma refused, but when the girl approached Kunté and Yudhiñöhira, they ordered Bhéma to accept her proposal and give her a son. As a result of this combination, Ghaöotkaca was born, and he fought very valiantly with his father against the Kauravas. In their forest life they lived with a brähmaëa family that was in trouble because of one Bakäsura demon, and Kunté ordered Bhéma to kill the Bakäsura to protect the brähmaëa family against troubles created by the demon. She advised Yudhiñöhira to start for the Päïcäladeça. Draupadé was gained in this Päïcäladeça by Arjuna, but by order of Kunté all five of the Päëòava brothers became equally the husbands of Päïcälé, or Draupadé. She was married with five Päëòavas in the presence of Vyäsadeva. Kuntédevé never forgot her first child, Karëa, and after Karëa's death in the Battle of Kurukñetra she lamented and admitted before her other sons that Karëa was her eldest son prior to her marriage with Mahäräja Päëòu. Her prayers for the Lord after the Battle of Kurukñetra, when Lord Kåñëa was going back home, are excellently explained. Later she went to the forest with Gändhäré for severe penance. She used to take meals after each thirty days. She finally sat down in profound meditation and later burned to ashes in a forest fire."

Mahäräja Drupada performed a great sacrifice under the superintendence of the sage Yaja. By his first offering, Dhåñöadyumna was born, and by the second offering, Draupadé was born. She is therefore the sister of Dhåñöadyumna, and she is also named Päïcälé. The five Päëòavas married her as a common wife, and each of them begot a son in her. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira begot a son named Pratibhit, Bhémasena begot a son named Sutasoma, Arjuna begot Çrutakérti, Nakula begot Çatänéka, and Sahadeva begot Çrutakarmä. She is described as a most beautiful lady, equal to her mother-in-law, Kunté. During her birth there was an aeromessage that she should be called Kåñëä. The same message also declared that she was born to kill many a kñatriya. By dint of her blessings from Çaìkara, she was awarded five husbands, equally qualified. When she preferred to select her own husband, princes and kings were invited from all the countries of the world. She was married with the Päëòavas during their exile in the forest, but when they went back home Mahäräja Drupada gave them immense wealth as a dowry. She was well received by all the daughters-in-law of Dhåtaräñöra. When she was lost in a gambling game, she was forcibly dragged into the assembly hall, and an attempt was made by Duùçäsana to see her naked beauty, even though there were elderly persons like Bhéñma and Droëa present. She was a great devotee of Lord Kåñëa, and by her praying, the Lord Himself became an unlimited garment to save her from the insult. A demon of the name Jaöäsura kidnapped her, but her second husband, Bhémasena, killed the demon and saved her. She saved the Päëòavas from the curse of Maharñi Durväsä by the grace of Lord Kåñëa. When the Päëòavas lived incognito in the palace of Viräöa, Kécaka was attracted by her exquisite beauty, and by arrangement with Bhéma the devil was killed and she was saved. She was very much aggrieved when her five sons were killed by Açvatthämä. At the last stage, she accompanied her husband Yudhiñöhira and others and fell on the way. The cause of her falling was explained by Yudhiñöhira, but when Yudhiñöhira entered the heavenly planet he saw Draupadé gloriously present there as the goddess of fortune in the heavenly planet."

The two brothers and sister are represented in the famous Jagannätha temple of Puré, and the temple is still visited by thousands of pilgrims daily. This temple is in remembrance of the Lord's visit at Kurukñetra during an occasion of solar eclipse and His subsequent meeting with the residents of Våndävana. The meeting of Rädhä and Kåñëa during this occasion is a very pathetic story, and Lord Çré Caitanya, in the ecstasy of Rädhäräëé, always pined for Lord Çré Kåñëa at Jagannätha Puré. While Arjuna was at Dvärakä, he wanted to have Subhadrä as his queen, and he expressed his desire to Lord Kåñëa. Çré Kåñëa knew that His elder brother, Lord Baladeva, was arranging her marriage elsewhere, and since He did not dare to go against the arrangement of Baladeva, He advised Arjuna to kidnap Subhadrä. So when all of them were on a pleasure trip on the Raivata Hill, Arjuna managed to kidnap Subhadrä according to the plan of Çré Kåñëa. Çré Baladeva was very angry at Arjuna, and He wanted to kill him, but Lord Kåñëa implored His brother to excuse Arjuna. Then Subhadrä was duly married with Arjuna, and Abhimanyu was born of Subhadrä. At the premature death of Abhimanyu, Subhadrä was very mortified, but on the birth of Parékñit she was happy and solaced."
