Among all such pure devotees of the Lord, Devarñi Närada is the chief, and therefore he has been described herein as the greatest of all philosopher devotees. Unless one has become a sufficiently learned philosopher by hearing the Vedänta philosophy from a bona fide spiritual master, one cannot be a learned philosopher devotee. One must be very faithful, learned and renounced, otherwise one cannot be a pure devotee. A pure devotee of the Lord can give us direction towards the other end of nescience. Devarñi Närada used to visit the palace of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira because the Päëòavas were all pure devotees of the Lord, and the Devarñi was always ready to give them good counsel whenever needed."
