The Yädavas and the Päëòavas, who were always rapt in the thought of the Lord Kåñëa and His different transcendental activities, were all pure devotees of the Lord like Vidura. Vidura left home in order to devote himself completely to the service of the Lord, but the Päëòavas and the Yädavas were always rapt in the thought of Lord Kåñëa. Thus there is no difference in their pure devotional qualities. Either remaining at home or leaving home, the real qualification of a pure devotee is to become rapt in the thought of Kåñëa favorably, i.e., knowing well that Lord Kåñëa is the Absolute Personality of Godhead. Kaàsa, Jaräsandha, Çiçupäla and other demons like them were also always rapt in the thought of Lord Kåñëa, but they were absorbed in a different way, namely unfavorably, or thinking Him to be a powerful man only. Therefore, Kaàsa and Çiçupäla are not on the same level as pure devotees like Vidura, the Päëòavas and the Yädavas."

Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was therefore on the same level of devotion as Vidura, although engaged in the state affairs of the kingdom of the world."
