And when he saw at last that Dhåtaräñöra had left home without his knowledge, his sorrows had no bound. He was fully compassionate toward Dhåtaräñöra because in the game of the Battle of Kurukñetra, King Dhåtaräñöra had lost everything, men and money, and at last the King and the Queen had to leave home in utter frustration. He studied the situation in his own way because he did not know that the inner vision of Dhåtaräñöra has been awakened by Vidura and that therefore he had left home in enthusiastic cheerfulness for a better life after departure from the dark well of home. Unless one is convinced of a better life after renunciation of the present life, one cannot stick to the renounced order of life simply by artificial dress or staying out of the home."
