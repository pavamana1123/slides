            "content": "Saubaliné, or Gändhäré, daughter of King Subala and wife of King Dhåtaräñöra, was ideal as a wife devoted to her husband. The Vedic civilization especially prepares chaste and devoted wives, of whom Gändhäré is one amongst many mentioned in history. Lakñméjé Sétädevé was also a daughter of a great king, but she followed her husband, Lord Rämacandra, into the forest. Similarly, as a woman Gändhäré could have remained at home or at her father's house, but as a chaste and gentle lady she followed her husband without consideration. Instructions for the renounced order of life were imparted to Dhåtaräñöra by Vidura, and Gändhäré was by the side of her husband. But he did not ask her to follow him because he was at that time fully determined, like a great warrior who faces all kinds of dangers in the battlefield. He was no longer attracted to so-called wife or relatives, and he decided to start alone, but as a chaste lady Gändhäré decided to follow her husband till the last moment. Mahäräja Dhåtaräñöra accepted the order of vänaprastha, and at this stage the wife is allowed to remain as a voluntary servitor, but in the sannyäsa stage no wife can stay with her former husband. A sannyäsé is considered to be a dead man civilly, and therefore the wife becomes a civil widow without connection with her former husband. Mahäräja Dhåtaräñöra did not deny his faithful wife, and she followed her husband at her own risk."

            "content": "The sannyäsés accept a rod as the sign of the renounced order of life. There are two types of sannyäsés. Those who follow the Mäyävädé philosophy, headed by Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya, accept only one rod (eka-daëòa), but those who follow the Vaiñëavite philosophy accept three combined rods (tri-daëòa). The Mäyävädé sannyäsés are ekadaëòi-svämés, whereas the Vaiñëava sannyäsés are known as tridaëòi-svämés, or more distinctly, tridaëòi-gosvämés, in order to be distinguished from the Mäyävädé philosophers. The ekadaëòi-svämés are mostly fond of the Himalayas, but the Vaiñëava sannyäsés are fond of Våndävana and Puré. The Vaiñëava sannyäsés are narottamas, whereas the Mäyävädé sannyäsés are dhéras. Mahäräja Dhåtaräñöra was advised to follow the dhéras because at that stage it was difficult for him to become a narottama."
