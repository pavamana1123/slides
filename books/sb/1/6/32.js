This transcendental instrument is identical with Lord Çré Kåñëa and Närada because all of them are of the same transcendental category. Sound vibrated by the instrument cannot be material, and therefore the glories and pastimes which are broadcast by the instrument of Närada are also transcendental, without a tinge of material inebriety. The seven singing meters, namely ña (ñaòja), å (åñabha), gä (gändhära), ma (madhyama), pa (païcama), dha (dhaivata) and ni (niñäda), are also transcendental and specifically meant for transcendental songs. As a pure devotee of the Lord, Çré Näradadeva is always fulfilling his obligation to the Lord for His gift of the instrument, and thus he is always engaged in singing His transcendental glories and is therefore infallible in his exalted position. Following in the footsteps of Çréla Närada Muni, a self-realized soul in the material world should also properly use the sound meters, namely ña, å, gä, mä, etc., in the service of the Lord by constantly singing the glories of the Lord, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä."
