The Personality of Godhead and His liberated devotees like Närada appear in the material world by the same process. As it is said in the Bhagavad-gétä, the birth and activities of the Lord are all transcendental. Therefore, according to authorized opinion, the birth of Närada as the son of Brahmä is also a transcendental pastime. His appearance and disappearance are practically on the same level as that of the Lord. The Lord and His devotees are therefore simultaneously one and different as spiritual entities. They belong to the same category of transcendence."
