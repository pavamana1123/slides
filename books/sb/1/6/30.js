    "translation": "After 4,300,000,000 solar years, when Brahmä awoke to create again by the will of the Lord, all the åñis like Maréci, Aìgirä, Atri and so on were created from the transcendental body of the Lord, and I also appeared along with them.",

So for this period Brahmäjé rests in yoga-nidrä within the body of the Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, the generator of Brahmä. Thus after the sleeping period of Brahmä, when there is again creation by the will of the Lord through the agency of Brahmä, all the great åñis again appear from different parts of the transcendental body, and Närada also appears. This means that Närada appears in the same transcendental body, just as a man awakes from sleep in the same body. Çré Närada is eternally free to move in all parts of the transcendental and material creations of the Almighty. He appears and disappears in his own transcendental body, which is without distinction of body and soul, unlike conditioned beings."
