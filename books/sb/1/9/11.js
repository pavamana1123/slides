Later on, when the Päëòavas were grown up, they were cheated by cunning Duryodhana and company, and Bhéñmadeva, although he knew that the Päëòavas were innocent and were unnecessarily put into trouble, could not take the side of the Päëòavas for political reasons. At the last stage of his life, when Bhéñmadeva saw his most exalted grandsons, headed by Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, sitting very gently at his side, the great warrior-grandfather could not check his loving tears, which were automatically flowing from his eyes. He remembered the great tribulations suffered by his most pious grandsons. Certainly he was the most satisfied man because of Yudhiñöhira's being enthroned in place of Duryodhana, and thus he began to congratulate them."
