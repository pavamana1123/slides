            "content": "Bhéñmadeva was not only a great family head of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, but also he was a great philosopher and friend to him, his brothers and his mother. Since Mahäräja Päëòu, the father of the five brothers headed by Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, had died, Bhéñmadeva was the most affectionate grandfather of the Päëòavas and caretaker of the widow daughter-in-law Kuntédevé. Although Mahäräja Dhåtaräñöra, the elder uncle of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, was there to look after them, his affection was more on the side of his hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana. Ultimately a colossal clique was fabricated to deprive the five fatherless brothers of the rightful claim of the kingdom of Hastinäpura. There was great intrigue, common in imperial palaces, and the five brothers were exiled to the wilderness. But Bhéñmadeva was always a sincerely sympathetic well-wisher, grandfather, friend and philosopher to Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, even up to the last moment of his life. He died very happily by seeing Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira to the throne, otherwise he would have long ago quitted his material body, instead of suffering agony over the undue sufferings of the Päëòavas. He was simply waiting for the opportune moment because he was sure and certain that the sons of Päëòu would come out victorious in the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, as His Lordship Çré Kåñëa was their protector. As a devotee of the Lord, he knew that the Lord's devotee cannot be vanquished at any time. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was quite aware of all these good wishes of Bhéñmadeva, and therefore he must have been feeling the great separation. He was sorry for the separation of a great soul, and not for the material body which Bhéñmadeva relinquished. The funeral ceremony was a necessary duty, although Bhéñmadeva was a liberated soul. Since Bhéñmadeva was without issue, the eldest grandson, namely Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, was the rightful person to perform this ceremony. It was a great boon to Bhéñmadeva that an equally great son of the family undertook the last rites of a great man."
