            "content": "The Battle of Kurukñetra was fought on military principles but at the same time in a sporting spirit, like a friend's fight with another friend. Duryodhana criticized Bhéñmadeva, alleging that he was reluctant to kill Arjuna because of paternal affection. A kñatriya cannot tolerate insults on the principle of fighting. Bhéñmadeva therefore promised that the next day he would kill all five Päëòavas with special weapons made for the purpose. Duryodhana was satisfied, and he kept the arrows with him to be delivered the next day during the fight. By tricks Arjuna took the arrows from Duryodhana, and Bhéñmadeva could understand that this was the trick of Lord Kåñëa. So he took a vow that the next day Kåñëa would have to take up weapons Himself, otherwise His friend Arjuna would die. In the next day's fighting Bhéñmadeva fought so violently that both Arjuna and Kåñëa were in trouble. Arjuna was almost defeated; the situation was so tense that he was about to be killed by Bhéñmadeva the very next moment. At that time Lord Kåñëa wanted to please His devotee, Bhéñma, by keeping Bhéñma's promise, which was more important than His own. Seemingly He broke His own promise. He promised before the beginning of the Battle of Kurukñetra that He would remain without weapons and would not use His strength for either of the parties. But to protect Arjuna He got down from the chariot, took up the wheel of the chariot and hurriedly rushed at Bhéñmadeva in an angry mood, as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He dropped His covering cloth on the way, and out of great anger He did not know that He had dropped it. Bhéñmadeva at once gave up his weapons and stood to be killed by Kåñëa, his beloved Lord. The fighting of the day was thus ended at that very moment, and Arjuna was saved. Of course there was no possibility of Arjuna's death because the Lord Himself was on the chariot, but because Bhéñmadeva wanted to see Lord Kåñëa take up some weapon to save His friend, the Lord created this situation, making Arjuna's death imminent. He stood before Bhéñmadeva to show him that his promise was fulfilled and that He had taken up the wheel."
