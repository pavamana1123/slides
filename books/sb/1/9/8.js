Çukadeva Gosvämé recited 1,400,000 verses of the Mahäbhärata in the councils of the Gandharvas, Yakñas and Räkñasas, and he recited Çrémad-Bhägavatam for the first time in the presence of Mahäräja Parékñit. He thoroughly studied all the Vedic literatures from his great father. Thus he was a completely purified soul by dint of his extensive knowledge in the principles of religion. From Mahäbhärata, Sabhä-parva (4.11) it is understood that he was also present in the royal assembly of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and at the fasting of Mahäräja Parékñit. As a bona fide disciple of Çré Vyäsadeva, he inquired from his father very extensively about religious principles and spiritual values, and his great father also satisfied him by teaching him the yoga system by which one can attain the spiritual kingdom, the difference between fruitive work and empiric knowledge, the ways and means of attaining spiritual realization, the four äçramas (namely the student life, the householder's life, the retired life and the renounced life), the sublime position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the process of seeing Him eye to eye, the bona fide candidate for receiving knowledge, the consideration of the five elements, the unique position of intelligence, the consciousness of the material nature and the living entity, the symptoms of the self-realized soul, the working principles of the material body, the symptoms of the influential modes of nature, the tree of perpetual desire, and psychic activities. Sometimes he went to the sun planet with the permission of his father and Näradajé. Descriptions of his travel in space are given in the Çänti-parva of the Mahäbhärata (332). At last he attained the transcendental realm. He is known by different names like Araëeya, Aruëisuta, Vaiyäsaki and Vyäsätmaja."

He is the father of the gigantic bird Garuòa, who was given elephants and tortoises as eatables. He married thirteen daughters of Prajäpati Dakña, and their names are Aditi, Diti, Danu, Käñöhä, Ariñöä, Surasä, Ilä, Muni, Krodhavaçä, Tämrä, Surabhi, Saramä and Timi. He begot many children, both demigods and demons, by those wives. From his first wife, Aditi, all the twelve Adityas were born; one of them is Vämana, the incarnation of Godhead. This great sage, Kaçyapa, was also present at the time of Arjuna's birth. He received a presentation of the whole world from Paraçuräma, and later on he asked Paraçuräma to go out of the world. His other name is Ariñöanemi. He lives on the northern side of the universe."

Çukräcärya was the spiritual master of the demons, and Båhaspati challenged him. His son is Kaca, and he delivered the fire weapon first to Bharadväja Muni. He begot six sons (like the fire-god) by his wife Candramäsé, one of the reputed stars. He could travel in space, and therefore he could present himself even in the planets of Brahmaloka and Indraloka. He advised the King of heaven, Indra, about conquering the demons. Once he cursed Indra, who thus had to become a hog on the earth and was unwilling to return to heaven. Such is the power of the attraction of the illusory energy. Even a hog does not wish to part with its earthly possessions in exchange for a heavenly kingdom. He was the religious preceptor of the natives of different planets."
