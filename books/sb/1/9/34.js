    "translation": "On the battlefield [where Çré Kåñëa attended Arjuna out of friendship], the flowing hair of Lord Kåñëa turned ashen due to the dust raised by the hoofs of the horses. And because of His labor, beads of sweat wetted His face. All these decorations, intensified by the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows, were enjoyed by Him. Let my mind thus go unto Çré Kåñëa.",

As such, transcendental loving service to the Lord in one of the five principal relations, namely çänta, däsya, sakhya, vätsalya and mädhurya, i.e., neutrality, servitorship, fraternity, filial affection and conjugal love, is graciously accepted by the Lord when offered to the Lord in genuine love and affection. Çré Bhéñmadeva is a great devotee of the Lord in the relation of servitorship. Thus his throwing of sharp arrows at the transcendental body of the Lord is as good as the worship of another devotee who throws soft roses upon Him."

            "content": "It appears that Bhéñmadeva is repenting the actions he committed against the person of the Lord. But factually the Lord's body was not at all pained, due to His transcendental existence. His body is not matter. Both He Himself and His body are complete spiritual identity. Spirit is never pierced, burnt, dried, moistened, etc. This is vividly explained in the Bhagavad-gétä. So also it is stated in the Skanda Puräëa. It is said there that spirit is always uncontaminated and indestructible. It cannot be distressed, nor can it be dried up. When Lord Viñëu in His incarnation appears before us, He seems to be like one of the conditioned souls, materially encaged, just to bewilder the asuras, or the nonbelievers, who are always alert to kill the Lord, even from the very beginning of His appearance. Kaàsa wanted to kill Kåñëa, and Rävaëa wanted to kill Räma, because foolishly they were unaware of the fact that the Lord is never killed, for the spirit is never annihilated."

Bhéñma's repentance and the Lord's merciful attitude are both unique in this picture."

            "content": "Çré Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, a great äcärya and devotee in the humor of conjugal love with the Lord, remarks very saliently in this regard. He says that the wounds created on the body of the Lord by the sharpened arrows of Bhéñmadeva were as pleasing to the Lord as the biting of a fiancee who bites the body of the Lord directed by a strong sense of sex desire. Such biting by the opposite sex is never taken as a sign of enmity, even if there is a wound on the body. Therefore, the fighting as an exchange of transcendental pleasure between the Lord and His pure devotee, Çré Bhéñmadeva, was not at all mundane. Besides that, since the Lord's body and the Lord are identical, there was no possibility of wounds in the absolute body. The apparent wounds caused by the sharpened arrows are misleading to the common man, but one who has a little absolute knowledge can understand the transcendental exchange in the chivalrous relation. The Lord was perfectly happy with the wounds caused by the sharpened arrows of Bhéñmadeva. The word vibhidyamäna is significant because the Lord's skin is not different from the Lord. Because our skin is different from our soul, in our case the word vibhidyamäna, or being bruised and cut, would have been quite suitable. Transcendental bliss is of different varieties, and the variety of activities in the mundane world is but a perverted reflection of transcendental bliss. Because everything in the mundane world is qualitatively mundane, it is full of inebrieties, whereas in the absolute realm, because everything is of the same absolute nature, there are varieties of enjoyment without inebriety. The Lord enjoyed the wounds created by His great devotee Bhéñmadeva, and because Bhéñmadeva is a devotee in the chivalrous relation, he fixes up his mind on Kåñëa in that wounded condition."
