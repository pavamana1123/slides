            "content": "The bewilderment of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira over his past sinful acts and the resultant sufferings, etc., is completely negated by the great authority Bhéñma (one of the twelve authorized persons). Bhéñma wanted to impress upon Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira that since time immemorial no one, including such demigods as Çiva and Brahmä, could ascertain the real plan of the Lord. So what can we understand about it? It is useless also to inquire about it. Even the exhaustive philosophical inquiries of sages cannot ascertain the plan of the Lord. The best policy is simply to abide by the orders of the Lord without argument. The sufferings of the Päëòavas were never due to their past deeds. The Lord had to execute the plan of establishing the kingdom of virtue, and therefore His own devotees suffered temporarily in order to establish the conquest of virtue. Bhéñmadeva was certainly satisfied by seeing the triumph of virtue, and he was glad to see King Yudhiñöhira on the throne, although he himself fought against him. Even a great fighter like Bhéñma could not win the Battle of Kurukñetra because the Lord wanted to show that vice cannot conquer virtue, regardless of who tries to execute it. Bhéñmadeva was a great devotee of the Lord, but he chose to fight against the Päëòavas by the will of the Lord because the Lord wanted to show that a fighter like Bhéñma cannot win on the wrong side."
