    "translation": "Now I can meditate with full concentration upon that one Lord, Çré Kåñëa, now present before me because now I have transcended the misconceptions of duality in regard to His presence in everyone's heart, even in the hearts of the mental speculators. He is in everyone's heart. The sun may be perceived differently, but the sun is one.",

The conception of duality is due to ignorance of His inconceivable energy. In the Bhagavad-gétä  that Väsudeva is all in all in everything and that there is no existence of anything without Väsudeva. Väsudeva, or Lord Çré Kåñëa, is the original Supreme Person, as now confirmed by a mahäjana, and therefore both the neophytes and the pure devotees must try to follow in his footsteps. That is the way of the devotional line."

            "content": "The worshipable object of Bhéñmadeva is Lord Çré Kåñëa as Pärtha-särathi, and that of the gopés is the same Kåñëa in Våndävana as the most attractive Çyämasundara. Sometimes less intelligent scholars make a mistake and think that the Kåñëa of Våndävana and that of the Battle of Kurukñetra are different personalities. But for Bhéñmadeva this misconception is completely removed. Even the impersonalist's object of destination is Kåñëa as the impersonal jyoti, and the yogé's destination of Paramätmä is also Kåñëa. Kåñëa is both brahmajyoti and localized Paramätmä, but in brahmajyoti or Paramätmä there is no Kåñëa or sweet relations with Kåñëa. In His personal feature Kåñëa is both Pärtha-särathi and Çyämasundara of Våndävana, but in His impersonal feature He is neither in the brahmajyoti nor in the Paramätmä. Great mahätmäs like Bhéñmadeva realize all these different features of Lord Çré Kåñëa, and therefore they worship Lord Kåñëa, knowing Him as the origin of all features."
