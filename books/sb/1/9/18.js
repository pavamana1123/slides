Such knowledge is never dogmatic, as ill conceived by less intelligent persons. The mother is the authority to verify the identity of the father. She is the authority for such confidential knowledge. Therefore, authority is not dogmatic. In the Bhagavad-gétä this truth is confirmed in the Fourth Chapter , and the perfect system of learning is to receive it from authority. The very same system is accepted universally as truth, but only the false arguer speaks against it. For example, modern spacecraft fly in the sky, and when scientists say that they travel to the other side of the moon, men believe these stories blindly because they have accepted the modern scientists as authorities. The authorities speak, and the people in general believe them. But in the case of Vedic truths, they have been taught not to believe. Even if they accept them they give a different interpretation. Each and every man wants a direct perception of Vedic knowledge, but foolishly they deny it. This means that the misguided man can believe one authority, the scientist, but will reject the authority of the Vedas. The result is that people have degenerated."

Even such an impersonalist as Äcärya Çaìkara has said in the beginning of his commentation on the Bhagavad-gétä that Näräyaëa, the Personality of Godhead, is beyond the material creation. The universe is one of the material creations, but Näräyaëa is transcendental to such material paraphernalia."

            "content": "Bhéñmadeva is one of the twelve mahäjanas who know the principles of transcendental knowledge. His confirmation of Lord Çré Kåñëa's being the original Personality of Godhead is also corroborated by the impersonalist Çaìkara. All other äcäryas have also confirmed this statement, and thus there is no chance of not accepting Lord Çré Kåñëa as the original Personality of Godhead. Bhéñmadeva says that He is the first Näräyaëa. This is also confirmed by Brahmäjé in the Bhägavatam . Kåñëa is the first Näräyaëa. In the spiritual world (Vaikuëöha) there are unlimited numbers of Näräyaëas, who are all the same Personality of Godhead and are considered to be the plenary expansions of the original Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. The first form of the Lord Çré Kåñëa first expands Himself as the form of Baladeva, and Baladeva expands in so many other forms, such as Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Väsudeva, Näräyaëa, Puruña, Räma and Nåsiàha. All these expansions are one and the same viñëu-tattva, and Çré Kåñëa is the original source of all the plenary expansions. He is therefore the direct Personality of Godhead. He is the creator of the material world, and He is the predominating Deity known as Näräyaëa in all the Vaikuëöha planets. Therefore, His movements amongst human beings is another sort of bewilderment. The Lord therefore says in the Bhagavad-gétä that foolish persons consider Him to be one of the human beings without knowing the intricacies of His movements."

            "content": "The bewilderment regarding Çré Kåñëa is due to the action of His twofold internal and external energies upon the third one, called marginal energy. The living entities are expansions of His marginal energy, and thus they are sometimes bewildered by the internal energy and sometimes by the external energy. By internal energetic bewilderment, Çré Kåñëa expands Himself into unlimited numbers of Näräyaëas and exchanges or accepts transcendental loving service from the living entities in the transcendental world. And by His external energetic expansions, He incarnates Himself in the material world amongst the men, animals or demigods to reestablish His forgotten relation with the living entities in different species of life. Great authorities like Bhéñma, however, escape His bewilderment by the mercy of the Lord."
