They are also spacemen competent to travel in the air without the help of any material vehicle. Parvata Muni is also a devarñi, or a great sage amongst the demigods, like Närada. He was present along with Närada at the sacrificial ceremony of Mahäräja Janamejaya, son of Mahäräja Parékñit. In this sacrifice all the snakes of the world were to be killed. Parvata Muni and Närada Muni are called Gandharvas also because they can travel in the air singing the glories of the Lord. Since they can travel in the air, they observed Draupadé's svayaàvara ceremony (selecting of her own husband) from the air. Like Närada Muni, Parvata Muni also used to visit the royal assembly in the heaven of King Indra. As a Gandharva, sometimes he visited the royal assembly of Kuvera, one of the important demigods. Both Närada and Parvata were once in trouble with the daughter of Mahäräja Såïjaya. Mahäräja Såïjaya got the benediction of a son by Parvata Muni."

In his previous life he was the son of a maidservant, but by good association with pure devotees he became enlightened in devotional service, and in the next life he became a perfect man comparable with himself only. In the Mahäbhärata his name is mentioned in many places. He is the principle devarñi, or the chief sage amongst the demigods. He is the son and disciple of Brahmäjé, and from him the disciplic succession in the line of Brahmä has been spread. He initiated Prahläda Mahäräja, Dhruva Mahäräja and many celebrated devotees of the Lord. He initiated even Vyäsadeva, the author of the Vedic literatures, and from Vyäsadeva, Madhväcärya was initiated, and thus the Madhva-sampradäya, in which the Gauòéya-sampradäya is also included, has spread all over the universe. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu belonged to this Madhva-sampradäya; therefore, Brahmäjé, Närada, Vyäsa, down to Madhva, Caitanya and the Gosvämés all belonged to the same line of disciplic succession. Näradajé has instructed many kings from time immemorial. In the Bhägavatam we can see that he instructed Prahläda Mahäräja while he was in the womb of his mother, and he instructed Vasudeva, father of Kåñëa, as well as Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira."

He acted as the priest in many religious functions of the Päëòavas (saàskära), and also each of the Päëòavas was attended by him at the betrothal of Draupadé. He was present even during the exile of the Päëòavas and used to advise them in circumstances when they were perplexed. He instructed them how to live incognito for one year, and his instructions were strictly followed by the Päëòavas during that time. His name is mentioned also when the general funeral ceremony was performed after the Battle of Kurukñetra. In the Anuñäsana-parva of Mahäbhärata (127.15-16), he gave religious instructions very elaborately to Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. He was actually the right type of priest of a householder, for he could guide the Päëòavas on the right path of religion. A priest is meant for guiding the householder progressively in the right path of äçrama-dharma, or the occupational duty of a particular caste. There is practically no difference between the family priest and the spiritual master. The sages, saints and brähmaëas were especially meant for such functions."

He is a powerful incarnation of Näräyaëa, and he broadcasts the Vedic wisdom to the world. As such, Vyäsadeva is offered respects before one chants the Vedic literature, especially the Puräëas. Çukadeva Gosvämé was his son, and åñis like Vaiçampäyana were his disciples for different branches of the Vedas. He is the author of the great epic Mahäbhärata and the great transcendental literature Bhägavatam. The Brahma-sütras—the Vedänta-sütras, or Bädaräyaëa-sütras—were compiled by him. Amongst sages he is the most respected author by dint of severe penances. When he wanted to record the great epic Mahäbhärata for the welfare of all people in the age of Kali, he was feeling the necessity of a powerful writer who could take up his dictation. By the order of Brahmäjé, Çré Gaëeçajé took up the charge of noting down the dictation on the condition that Vyäsadeva would not stop dictation for a moment. The Mahäbhärata was thus compiled by the joint endeavor of Vyäsa and Gaëeça."

As a perfect brähmaëa he tolerated all the taunts of Viçvämitra. Once he tried to commit suicide on account of Viçvämitra's torture, but all his attempts were unsuccessful. He jumped from a hill, but the stones on which he fell became a stack of cotton, and thus he was saved. He jumped into the ocean, but the waves washed him ashore. He jumped into the river, but the river also washed him ashore. Thus all his suicide attempts were unsuccessful. He is also one of the seven åñis and husband of Arundhaté, the famous star."
