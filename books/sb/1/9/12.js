Bhéñmadeva could understand this, and therefore he spoke first of the terrible sufferings of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. He was put into difficulty by injustice only, and the Battle of Kurukñetra was fought just to counteract this injustice. Therefore, he should not regret the great massacre. He wanted to point out particularly that they were always protected by the brähmaëas, the Lord and religious principles. As long as they were protected by these three important items, there was no cause of disappointment. Thus Bhéñmadeva encouraged Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira to dissipate his despondency. As long as a person is fully in cooperation with the wishes of the Lord, guided by the bona fide brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas and strictly following religious principles, one has no cause for despondency, however trying the circumstances of life. Bhéñmadeva, as one of the authorities in the line, wanted to impress this point upon the Päëòavas."
