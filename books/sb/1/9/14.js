            "content": "There is control by time all over the space within the universe, as there is control by time all over the planets. All the big gigantic planets, including the sun, are being controlled by the force of air, as the clouds are carried by the force of air. Similarly, the inevitable käla, or time, controls even the action of the air and other elements. Everything, therefore, is controlled by the supreme käla, a forceful representative of the Lord within the material world. Thus Yudhiñöhira should not be sorry for the inconceivable action of time. Everyone has to bear the actions and reactions of time as long as one is within the conditions of the material world. Yudhiñöhira should not think that he had committed sins in his previous birth and is suffering the consequence. Even the most pious has to suffer the condition of material nature. But a pious man is faithful to the Lord, for he is guided by the bona fide brähmaëa and Vaiñëava following the religious principles. These three guiding principles should be the aim of life. One should not be disturbed by the tricks of eternal time. Even the great controller of the universe, Brahmäjé, is also under the control of that time; therefore, one should not grudge being thus controlled by time despite being a true follower of religious principles."
