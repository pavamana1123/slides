After the Battle of Kurukñetra, the celebrated couple, having lost all their sons and grandsons, were under the care of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. They were passing their days in great agony over such a heavy loss of life and were practically living the life of ascetics. The death news of Bhéñmadeva, uncle of Dhåtaräñöra, was another great shock for the King and the Queen, and therefore they required solace from Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was conscious of his duty, and he at once hurried to the spot with Lord Kåñëa and satisfied the bereaved Dhåtaräñöra with kind words, from both himself and the Lord also."

            "content": "Gändhäré was a powerful ascetic, although she was living the life of a faithful wife and a kind mother. It is said that Gändhäré also voluntarily closed her eyes because of the blindness of her husband. A wife's duty is to follow the husband cent percent. And Gändhäré was so true to her husband that she followed him even in his perpetual blindness. Therefore in her actions she was a great ascetic. Besides that, the shock she suffered because of the wholesale killing of her one hundred sons and her grandsons also was certainly too much for a woman. But she suffered all this just like an ascetic. Gändhäré, although a woman, is no less than Bhéñmadeva in character. They are both remarkable personalities in the Mahäbhärata."
