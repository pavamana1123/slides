            "content": "Bhéñmadeva, speaking in that appealing tone, convinced Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira that he was very soon passing away. And Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was inspired by Lord Çré Kåñëa to ask him of the principles of religion. Lord Çré Kåñëa inspired Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira to ask Bhéñmadeva in the presence of many great sages, indicating thereby that the Lord's devotee like Bhéñmadeva, although apparently living as a worldly man, is far superior to many great sages, even Vyäsadeva. Another point is that Bhéñmadeva at that time was not only lying on a deathbed of arrows, but was greatly aggrieved because of that state. One should not have asked him any question at that time, but Lord Çré Kåñëa wanted to prove that His pure devotees are always sound in body and mind by dint of spiritual enlightenment, and thus in any circumstances a devotee of the Lord is in perfect order to speak of the right way of life. Yudhiñöhira also preferred to solve his problematic questions by asking Bhéñmadeva rather than ask anyone else present there who was seemingly more learned than Bhéñmadeva. This is all due to the arrangement of the great wheel-carrier Lord Çré Kåñëa, who establishes the glories of His devotee. The father likes to see the son become more famous than himself. The Lord declares very emphatically that worship of His devotee is more valuable than the worship of the Lord Himself."
