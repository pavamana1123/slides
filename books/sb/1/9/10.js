He is present always in His eternal abode Goloka Våndävana, and still He is present in everyone's heart and even within every invisible atom. When He manifests His eternal transcendental form in the material world, He does so by His internal potency. The external potency, or the material energy, has nothing to do with His eternal form. All these truths were known to Çré Bhéñmadeva, who worshiped Him accordingly."
