    "translation": "O how wonderful is the influence of inevitable time. It is irreversible-otherwise, how can there be reverses in the presence of King Yudhiñöhira, the son of the demigod controlling religion; Bhéma, the great fighter with a club; the great bowman Arjuna with his mighty weapon Gäëòéva; and above all, the Lord, the direct well-wisher of the Päëòavas?",

Materially they were well equipped because two great warriors, namely Bhéma and Arjuna, were there. Spiritually the King himself was the symbol of religion, and above all of them the Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa, was personally concerned with their affairs as the well-wisher. And yet there were so many reverses on the side of the Päëòavas. Despite the power of pious acts, the power of personalities, the power of expert management and the power of weapons under the direct supervision of Lord Kåñëa, the Päëòavas suffered so many practical reverses, which can only be explained as due to the influence of käla, inevitable time. Käla is identical with the Lord Himself, and therefore the influence of käla indicates the inexplicable wish of the Lord Himself. There is nothing to be lamented when a matter is beyond the control of any human being."
