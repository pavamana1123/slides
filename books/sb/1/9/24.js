            "content": "Bhéñmadeva knew well that Lord Kåñëa is the original Näräyaëa. His worshipable Deity was four-handed Näräyaëa, but he knew that four-handed Näräyaëa is a plenary expansion of Lord Kåñëa. Indirectly he desired Lord Çré Kåñëa to manifest Himself in His four-handed feature of Näräyaëa. A Vaiñëava is always humble in his behavior. Although it was cent percent certain that Bhéñmadeva was approaching Vaikuëöha-dhäma just after leaving his material body, still as a humble Vaiñëava he desired to see the beautiful face of the Lord, for after quitting the present body he might not be in a position to see the Lord any more. A Vaiñëava is not puffed up, although the Lord guarantees His pure devotee entrance into His abode. Here Bhéñmadeva says, \"as long as I do not quit this body.\" This means that the great General would quit the body by his own will; he was not being forced by the laws of nature. He was so powerful that he could stay in his body as long as he desired. He got this benediction from his father. He desired that the Lord stay before him in His four-handed Näräyaëa feature so that he might concentrate upon Him and thus be in trance in that meditation. Then his mind might be sanctified with thinking of the Lord. Thus he did not mind wherever he might go. A pure devotee is never very anxious to go back to the kingdom of God. He entirely depends on the good will of the Lord. He is equally satisfied even if the Lord desires him to go to hell. The only desire that a pure devotee entertains is that he may always be in rapt attention with thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord, regardless. Bhéñmadeva wanted this much only: that his mind be absorbed in thinking of the Lord and that he pass away thus. That is the highest ambition of a pure devotee."
