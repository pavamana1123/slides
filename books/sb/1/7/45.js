A devoted wife, who is according to revealed scripture the better half of her husband, is justified in embracing voluntary death along with her husband if she is without issue. But in the case of the wife of Droëäcärya, she did not undergo such a trial because she had her son, the representative of her husband. A widow is a widow only in name if there is a son of her husband existing. So in either case Açvatthämä was the representative of Droëäcärya, and therefore killing Açvatthämä would be like killing Droëäcärya. That was the argument of Draupadé against the killing of Açvatthämä."
