            "content": "In the ultimate issue only, when there is no alternative, the nuclear weapon called the brahmästra is applied. The word dvijätmajaù is significant here because Açvatthämä, although the son of Droëäcärya, was not exactly a qualified brähmaëa. The most intelligent man is called a brähmaëa, and it is not a hereditary title. Açvatthämä was also formerly called the brahma-bandhu, or the friend of a brähmaëa. Being a friend of a brähmaëa does not mean that one is a brähmaëa by qualification. A friend or son of a brähmaëa, when fully qualified, can be called a brähmaëa and not otherwise. Since Açvatthämä's decision is immature, he is purposely called herein the son of a brähmaëa."
