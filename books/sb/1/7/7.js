One can protect himself from the hands of an enemy while awake, but while asleep one is protected by the ear only. The importance of hearing is mentioned here in connection with attaining the highest perfection of life, namely, getting free from three material pangs. Everyone is full of lamentation at every moment, he is after the mirage of illusory things, and he is always afraid of his supposed enemy. These are the primary symptoms of material disease. And it is definitely suggested herein that simply by hearing the message of Çrémad-Bhägavatam one gets attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa, and as soon as this is effected the symptoms of the material diseases disappear. Çréla Vyäsadeva saw the all-perfect Personality of Godhead, and in this statement the all-perfect Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa is clearly confirmed."

            "content": "The ultimate result of devotional service is to develop genuine love for the Supreme Personality. Love is a word which is often used in relation with man and woman. And love is the only word that can be properly used to indicate the relation between Lord Kåñëa and the living entities. The living entities are mentioned as prakåti in the Bhagavad-gétä, and in Sanskrit prakåti is a feminine object. The Lord is always described as the parama-puruña, or the supreme male personality. Thus the affection between the Lord and the living entities is something like that between the male and the female. Therefore the term love of Godhead is quite appropriate."

            "content": "Loving devotional service to the Lord begins with hearing about the Lord. There is no difference between the Lord and the subject matter heard about Him. The Lord is absolute in all respects, and thus there is no difference between Him and the subject matter heard about Him. Therefore, hearing about Him means immediate contact with Him by the process of vibration of the transcendental sound. And the transcendental sound is so effective that it acts at once by removing all material affections mentioned above. As mentioned before, a living entity develops a sort of complexity by material association, and the illusory encagement of the material body is accepted as an actual fact. Under such false complexity, the living beings under different categories of life become illusioned in different ways. Even in the most developed stage of human life, the same illusion prevails in the form of many isms and divides the loving relation with the Lord and thereby divides the loving relation between man and man. By hearing the subject matter of Çrémad-Bhägavatam this false complexity of materialism is removed, and real peace in society begins, which politicians aspire for so eagerly in so many political situations. The politicians want a peaceful situation between man and man, and nation and nation, but at the same time, because of too much attachment for material domination, there is illusion and fearfulness. Therefore the politicians' peace conferences cannot bring about peace in society. It can only be done by hearing the subject matter described in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam about the Supreme Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. The foolish politicians may go on holding peace and summit conferences for hundreds of years, but they will fail to achieve success. Until we reach the stage of reestablishing our lost relation with Kåñëa, the illusion of accepting the body as the self will prevail, and thus fearfulness will also prevail. As for the validity of Çré Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are hundreds and thousands of evidences from revealed scriptures, and there are hundreds and thousands of evidences from personal experiences of devotees in various places like Våndävana, Navadvépa and Puré. Even in the Kaumudé dictionary the synonyms of Kåñëa are given as the son of Yaçodä and the Supreme Personality of Godhead Parabrahman. The conclusion is that simply by hearing the Vedic literature Çrémad-Bhägavatam, one can have direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa, and thereby one can attain the highest perfection of life by transcending worldly miseries, illusion and fearfulness. These are practical tests for one who has actually given a submissive hearing to the readings of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam."
