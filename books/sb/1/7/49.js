One should not tolerate the humiliation of a member of a great family. Arjuna and his family were indebted to the family of Droëäcärya because of Arjuna's learning the military science from him. If ingratitude were shown to such a benevolent family, it would not be at all justified from the moral standpoint. The wife of Droëäcärya, who was the half body of the great soul, must be treated with compassion, and she should not be put into grief because of her son's death. That is compassion. Such statements by Draupadé are without duplicity because actions should be taken with full knowledge. The feeling of equality was there because Draupadé spoke out of her personal experience. A barren woman cannot understand the grief of a mother. Draupadé was herself a mother, and therefore her calculation of the depth of Kåpé's grief was quite to the point. And it was glorious because she wanted to show proper respect to a great family."
