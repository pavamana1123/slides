    "translation": "Çré Süta Gosvämé said: Draupadé then saw Açvatthämä, who was bound with ropes like an animal and silent for having enacted the most inglorious murder. Due to her female nature, and due to her being naturally good and well-behaved, she showed him due respects as a brähmaëa.",

But when he was brought before Çrématé Draupadé, she, although begrieved for the murder of her sons, and although the murderer was present before her, could not withdraw the due respect generally offered to a brähmaëa or to the son of a brähmaëa. This is due to her mild nature as a woman. Women as a class are no better than boys, and therefore they have no discriminatory power like that of a man. Açvatthämä proved himself to be an unworthy son of Droëäcärya or of a brähmaëa, and for this reason he was condemned by the greatest authority, Lord Çré Kåñëa, and yet a mild woman could not withdraw her natural courtesy for a brähmaëa."

But, anyway, we should not give up our reason and discriminatory power just to be gentle. One must have good discriminatory power to judge a thing on its merit. We should not follow the mild nature of a woman and thereby accept that which is not genuine. Açvatthämä may be respected by a good-natured woman, but that does not mean that he is as good as a genuine brähmaëa."
