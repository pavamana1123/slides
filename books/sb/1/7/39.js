Although he joined the enemy camp, the Päëòavas held him always in respect, and Arjuna saluted him before beginning the fight. There was nothing wrong in that way. But the son of Droëäcärya degraded himself by committing acts which are never done by the dvijas, or the twice-born higher castes. Açvatthämä, the son of Droëäcärya, committed murder by killing the five sleeping sons of Draupadé, by which he dissatisfied his master Duryodhana, who never approved of the heinous act of killing the five sleeping sons of the Päëòavas. This means that Açvatthämä became an assaulter of Arjuna's own family members, and thus he was liable to be punished by him. In the çästras, he who attacks without notice or kills from behind or sets fire to another's house or kidnaps one's wife is condemned to death. Kåñëa reminded Arjuna of these facts so that he might take notice of them and do the needful."
