According to Çrédhara Svämé, Arjuna was obliged to catch this son of a brähmaëa like an animal as a part of his duty (dharma). This suggestion by Çrédhara Svämé is also confirmed in the later statement of Çré Kåñëa. Açvatthämä was a bona fide son of Droëäcärya and Kåpé, but because he had degraded himself to a lower status of life, it was proper to treat him as an animal and not as a brähmaëa."
