            "content": "Lord Kåñëa is so kind to the fallen souls that He personally incarnates Himself amongst the different kinds of living entities and takes part with them in daily activities. Any historical fact old or new which has a connection with the activities of the Lord is to be understood as a transcendental narration of the Lord. Without Kåñëa, all the supplementary literatures like the Puräëas and Mahäbhärata are simply stories or historical facts. But with Kåñëa they become transcendental, and when we hear of them we at once become transcendentally related with the Lord. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is also a Puräëa, but the special significance of this Puräëa is that the activities of the Lord are central and not just supplementary historical facts. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is thus recommended by Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu as the spotless Puräëa. There is a class of less intelligent devotees of the Bhägavata Puräëa who desire to relish at once the activities of the Lord narrated in the Tenth Canto without first understanding the primary cantos. They are under the false impression that the other cantos are not concerned with Kåñëa, and thus more foolishly than intelligently they take to the reading of the Tenth Canto. These readers are specifically told herein that the other cantos of the Bhägavatam are as important as the Tenth Canto. No one should try to go into the matters of the Tenth Canto without having thoroughly understood the purport of the other nine cantos. Kåñëa and His pure devotees like the Päëòavas are on the same plane. Kåñëa is not without His devotees of all the rasas, and the pure devotees like the Päëòavas are not without Kåñëa. The devotees and the Lord are interlinked, and they cannot be separated. Therefore talks about them are all kåñëa-kathä, or topics of the Lord."
