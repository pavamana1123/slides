Such an aggressor, though he be a brähmaëa or a so-called son of a brähmaëa, has to be punished in all circumstances. When Arjuna promised to behead the aggressor named Açvatthämä, he knew well that Açvatthämä was the son of a brähmaëa, but because the so-called brähmaëa acted like a butcher, he was taken as such, and there was no question of sin in killing such a brähmaëa's son who proved to be a villain."
