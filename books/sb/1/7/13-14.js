    "translation": "When the respective warriors of both camps, namely the Kauravas and the Päëòavas, were killed on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra and the dead warriors obtained their deserved destinations, and when the son of Dhåtaräñöra fell down lamenting, his spine broken, being beaten by the club of Bhémasena, the son of Droëäcärya [Açvatthämä] beheaded the five sleeping sons of Draupadé and delivered them as a prize to his master, foolishly thinking that he would be pleased. Duryodhana, however, disapproved of the heinous act, and he was not pleased in the least.",

            "content": "Transcendental topics of the activities of Lord Çré Kåñëa in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam begin from the end of the battle at Kurukñetra, where the Lord Himself spoke about Himself in the Bhagavad-gétä. Therefore, both the Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam are transcendental topics of Lord Kåñëa. The Gétä is kåñëa-kathä, or topics of Kåñëa, because it is spoken by the Lord, and the Bhägavatam is also kåñëa-kathä because it is spoken about the Lord. Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu wanted everyone to be informed of both kåñëa-kathäs by His order. Lord Kåñëa Caitanya is Kåñëa Himself in the garb of a devotee of Kåñëa, and therefore the versions of both Lord Kåñëa and Çré Kåñëa Caitanya Mahäprabhu are identical. Lord Caitanya desired that all who are born in India seriously understand such kåñëa-kathäs and then after full realization preach the transcendental message to everyone in all parts of the world. That will bring about the desired peace and prosperity of the stricken world."
