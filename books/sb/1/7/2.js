The place on the western bank of the Sarasvaté is especially suitable for this purpose. And there is the äçrama of Vyäsadeva at Çamyäpräsa. Çréla Vyäsadeva was a householder, yet his residential place is called an äçrama. An äçrama is a place where spiritual culture is always foremost. It does not matter whether the place belongs to a householder or a mendicant. The whole varëäçrama system is so designed that each and every status of life is called an äçrama. This means that spiritual culture is the common factor for all. The brahmacärés, the gåhasthas, the vänaprasthas and the sannyäsés all belong to the same mission of life, namely, realization of the Supreme. Therefore none of them are less important as far as spiritual culture is concerned. The difference is a matter of formality on the strength of renunciation. The sannyäsés are held in high estimation on the strength of practical renunciation."
