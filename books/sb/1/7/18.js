Kaù means Brahmä, who once became allured by his daughter and began to follow her, which infuriated Çiva, who attacked Brahmä with his trident. Brahmäjé fled in fear of his life. As far as arkaù is concerned, there is a reference in the Vämana Puräëa. There was a demon by the name Vidyunmälé who was gifted with a glowing golden airplane which traveled to the back of the sun, and night disappeared because of the glowing effulgence of this plane. Thus the sun-god became angry, and with his virulent rays he melted the plane. This enraged Lord Çiva. Lord Çiva then attacked the sun-god, who fled away and at last fell down at Käçé (Väräëasé), and the place became famous as Lolärka."
