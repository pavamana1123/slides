He is encouraged herein personally by the Lord to kill the son of Droëa, but Arjuna considers that the son of his great teacher should be spared, for he happens to be the son of Droëäcärya, even though he is an unworthy son, having done all sorts of heinous acts whimsically for no one's benefit."

It is not that Arjuna was incomplete in the sense of his duty, nor was Lord Çré Kåñëa unaware of Arjuna's sense of duty. But Lord Çré Kåñëa put to test many of His pure devotees just to magnify the sense of duty. The gopés were put to such tests as well. Prahläda Mahäräja also was put to such a test. All pure devotees come out successful in the respective tests by the Lord."
