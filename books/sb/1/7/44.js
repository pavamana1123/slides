            "content": "Dhanur-veda, or military science, was taught by Droëäcärya with all its confidential secrets of throwing and controlling by Vedic hymns. Gross military science is dependent on material weapons, but finer than that is the art of throwing the arrows saturated with Vedic hymns, which act more effectively than gross material weapons like machine guns or atomic bombs. The control is by Vedic mantras, or the transcendental science of sound. It is said in the Rämäyaëa that Mahäräja Daçaratha, the father of Lord Çré Räma, used to control arrows by sound only. He could pierce his target with his arrow by only hearing the sound, without seeing the object. So this is a finer military science than that of the gross material military weapons used nowadays. Arjuna was taught all this, and therefore Draupadé wished that Arjuna feel obliged to Äcärya Droëa for all these benefits. And in the absence of Droëäcärya, his son was his representative. That was the opinion of the good lady Draupadé. It may be argued why Droëäcärya, a rigid brähmaëa, should be a teacher in military science. But the reply is that a brähmaëa should become a teacher, regardless of what his department of knowledge is. A learned brähmaëa should become a teacher, a priest and a recipient of charity. A bona fide brähmaëa is authorized to accept such professions."
