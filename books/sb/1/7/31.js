Although the brahmästra was released on this earth, the heat produced by the combination of both weapons covered all the universe, and all the populations on all the different planets began to feel the heat excessively and compared it to that of the säàvartaka fire. No planet, therefore, is without living beings, as less intelligent materialistic men think."
