But by subtle science the action of a brahmästra can be counteracted, and those who were expert in the military science in those days could counteract the brahmästra. The son of Droëäcärya did not know the art of counteracting the weapon, and therefore Arjuna was asked to counteract it by the power of his own weapon."
