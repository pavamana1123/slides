            "content": "The word brahma-bandhu is significant. A person who happens to take birth in the family of a brähmaëa but is not qualified to be called a brähmaëa is addressed as the relative of a brähmaëa, and not as a brähmaëa. The son of a high-court judge is not virtually a high-court judge, but there is no harm in addressing a high-court judge's son as a relative of the Honorable Justice. Therefore, as by birth only one does not become a high-court judge, so also one does not become a brähmaëa simply by birthright but by acquiring the necessary qualifications of a brähmaëa. As the high-court judgeship is a post for the qualified man, so also the post of a brähmaëa is attainable by qualification only. The çästra enjoins that even if good qualifications are seen in a person born in a family other than that of a brähmaëa, the qualified man has to be accepted as a brähmaëa, and similarly if a person born in the family of a brähmaëa is void of brahminical qualification, then he must be treated as a non-brähmaëa or, in better terms, a relative of a brähmaëa. Lord Çré Kåñëa, the supreme authority of all religious principles, the Vedas, has personally pointed out these differences, and He is about to explain the reason for this in the following çlokas."
