            "content": "Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the natural commentation on the Brahma-sütras compiled by the same author. This Brahma-sütra, or Vedänta-sütra, is meant for those who are already engaged in self-realization. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is so made that one becomes at once engaged in the path of self-realization simply by hearing the topics. Although it is especially meant for the paramahaàsas, or those who are totally engaged in self-realization, it works into the depths of the hearts of those who may be worldly men. Worldly men are all engaged in sense gratification. But even such men will find in this Vedic literature a remedial measure for their material diseases. Çukadeva Gosvämé was a liberated soul from the very beginning of his birth, and his father taught him Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Amongst mundane scholars, there is some diversity of opinion as to the date of compilation of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. It is, however, certain from the text of the Bhägavatam that it was compiled before the disappearance of King Parékñit and after the departure of Lord Kåñëa. When Mahäräja Parékñit was ruling the world as the King of Bhärata-varña, he chastised the personality of Kali. According to revealed scriptures and astrological calculation, the age of Kali is in its five thousandth year. Therefore, Çrémad-Bhägavatam was compiled not less than five thousand years ago. Mahäbhärata was compiled before Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and the Puräëas were compiled before Mahäbhärata. That is an estimation of the date of compilation of the different Vedic literatures. The synopsis of Çrémad-Bhägavatam was given before the detailed description under instruction of Närada. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the science for following the path of nivåtti-märga. The path of pravåtti-märga was condemned by Närada. That path is the natural inclination for all conditioned souls. The theme of Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the cure of the materialistic disease of the human being, or stopping completely the pangs of material existence."
