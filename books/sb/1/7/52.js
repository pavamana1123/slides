            "content": "Lord Çré Kåñëa had two arms, and why He is designated as four-armed is explained by Çrédhara Svämé. Both Bhéma and Draupadé held opposite views about killing Açvatthämä. Bhéma wanted him to be immediately killed, whereas Draupadé wanted to save him. We can imagine Bhéma ready to kill while Draupadé is obstructing him. And in order to prevent both of them, the Lord discovered another two arms. Originally, the primeval Lord Çré Kåñëa displays only two arms, but in His Näräyaëa feature He exhibits four. In His Näräyaëa feature He resides with His devotees in the Vaikuëöha planets, while in His original Çré Kåñëa feature He resides in the Kåñëaloka planet far, far above the Vaikuëöha planets in the spiritual sky. Therefore, if Çré Kåñëa is called caturbhujaù, there is no contradiction. If need be He can display hundreds of arms, as He exhibited in His viçva-rüpa shown to Arjuna. Therefore, one who can display hundreds and thousands of arms can also manifest four whenever needed."
