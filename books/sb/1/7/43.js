Kåñëa also knew him to be so, but both of them condemned the murderer without consideration of his being the son of a brähmaëa. According to revealed scriptures, a teacher or spiritual master is liable to be rejected if he proves himself unworthy of the position of a guru or spiritual master. A guru is called also an äcärya, or a person who has personally assimilated all the essence of çästras and has helped his disciples to adopt the ways. Açvatthämä failed to discharge the duties of a brähmaëa or teacher, and therefore he was liable to be rejected from the exalted position of a brähmaëa. On this consideration, both Lord Çré Kåñëa and Arjuna were right in condemning Açvatthämä. But to a good lady like Draupadé, the matter was considered not from the angle of çästric vision, but as a matter of custom. By custom, Açvatthämä was offered the same respect as offered to his father. It was so because generally the people accept the son of a brähmaëa as a real brähmaëa, by sentiment only. Factually the matter is different. A brähmaëa is accepted on the merit of qualification and not on the merit of simply being the son of a brähmaëa."

            "content": "But in spite of all this, Draupadé desired that Açvatthämä be at once released, and it was all the same a good sentiment for her. This means that a devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulation personally, but still such devotees are never unkind to others, even to the enemy. These are the characteristics of one who is a pure devotee of the Lord."
