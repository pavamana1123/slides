    "translation": "Çré Çaunaka asked Süta Gosvämé: Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé was already on the path of self-realization, and thus he was pleased with his own self. So why did he take the trouble to undergo the study of such a vast literature?",

            "content": "For the people in general the highest perfection of life is to cease from material activities and be fixed on the path of self-realization. Those who take pleasure in sense enjoyment, or those who are fixed in material bodily welfare work, are called karmés. Out of thousands and millions of such karmés, one may become an ätmäräma by self-realization. Ätmä means self, and äräma means to take pleasure. Everyone is searching after the highest pleasure, but the standard of pleasure of one may be different from the standard of another. Therefore, the standard of pleasure enjoyed by the karmés is different from that of the ätmärämas. The ätmärämas are completely indifferent to material enjoyment in every respect. Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé had already attained that stage, and still he was attracted to undergo the trouble of studying the great Bhägavatam literature. This means that Çrémad-Bhägavatam is a postgraduate study even for the ätmärämas, who have surpassed all the studies of Vedic knowledge."
