The Lord decided to stay especially to pacify the aggrieved King as well as to please Subhadrä, sister of Lord Çré Kåñëa. Subhadrä was especially to be pacified because she lost her only son, Abhimanyu, who was just married. The boy left his wife, Uttarä, mother of Mahäräja Parékñit. The Lord is always pleased to satisfy His devotees in any capacity. Only His devotees can play the parts of His relatives. The Lord is absolute."
