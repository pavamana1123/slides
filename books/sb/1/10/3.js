            "content": "The modern English law of primogeniture, or the law of inheritance by the firstborn, was also prevalent in those days when Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira ruled the earth and seas. In those days the King of Hastinäpura (now part of New Delhi) was the emperor of the world, including the seas, up to the time of Mahäräja Parékñit, the grandson of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira's younger brothers were acting as his ministers and commanders of state, and there was full cooperation between the perfectly religious brothers of the King. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was the ideal king or representative of Lord Çré Kåñëa to rule over the kingdom of earth and was comparable to King Indra, the representative ruler of the heavenly planets. The demigods like Indra, Candra, Sürya, Varuëa and Väyu are representative kings of different planets of the universe, and similarly Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was also one of them, ruling over the kingdom of the earth. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was not a typically unenlightened political leader of modern democracy. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was instructed by Bhéñmadeva and the infallible Lord also, and therefore he had full knowledge of everything in perfection."

            "content": "The modern elected executive head of a state is just like a puppet because he has no kingly power. Even if he is enlightened like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, he cannot do anything out of his own good will due to his constitutional position. Therefore, there are so many states over the earth quarreling because of ideological differences or other selfish motives. But a king like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira had no ideology of his own. He had but to follow the instructions of the infallible Lord and the Lord's representative and the authorized agent, Bhéñmadeva. It is instructed in the çästras that one should follow the great authority and the infallible Lord without any personal motive and manufactured ideology. Therefore, it was possible for Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira to rule the whole world, including the seas, because the principles were infallible and universally applicable to everyone. The conception of one world state can only be fulfilled if we can follow the infallible authority. An imperfect human being cannot create an ideology acceptable to everyone. Only the perfect and the infallible can create a program which is applicable at every place and can be followed by all in the world. It is the person who rules, and not the impersonal government. If the person is perfect, the government is perfect. If the person is a fool, the government is a fool's paradise. That is the law of nature. There are so many stories of imperfect kings or executive heads. Therefore, the executive head must be a trained person like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, and he must have the full autocratic power to rule over the world. The conception of a world state can take shape only under the regime of a perfect king like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. The world was happy in those days because there were kings like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira to rule over the world."
