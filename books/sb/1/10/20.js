            "content": "In the Bhagavad-gétä it is said that in all the Vedic literatures the goal is the Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. Factually the glories of the Lord are depicted in such literature as the Vedas, Rämäyaëa and Mahäbhärata. And in the Bhägavatam they are specifically mentioned in respect to the Supreme Lord. Therefore, while the ladies on the tops of the houses in the capital of the kings of the Kuru dynasty were talking about the Lord, their talk was more pleasing than the Vedic hymns. Anything sung in the praise of the Lord is Çruti-mantra. There are songs of Öhäkura Narottama däsa, one of the äcäryas in the Gauòéya-sampradäya, composed in simple Bengali language. But Öhäkura Viçvanätha Cakravarté, another very learned äcärya of the same sampradäya, has approved the songs by Öhäkura Narottama däsa to be as good as Vedic mantras. And this is so because of the subject matter. The language is immaterial, but the subject matter is important. The ladies, who were all absorbed in the thought and actions of the Lord, developed the consciousness of Vedic wisdom by the grace of the Lord. And therefore although such ladies might not have been very learned scholars in Sanskrit or otherwise, still whatever they spoke was more attractive than the Vedic hymns. The Vedic hymns in the Upaniñads are sometimes indirectly directed to the Supreme Lord. But the talks of the ladies were directly spoken of the Lord, and thus they were more pleasing to the heart. The ladies' talks appeared to be more valuable than the learned brähmaëas' benedictions."
