            "content": "At places there were sounds of Vedic benediction aiming at the Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. The benedictions were fitting in the sense that the Lord was playing the part of a human being, as if a cousin of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, but they were also unfitting because the Lord is absolute and has nothing to do with any kind of material relativities. He is nirguëa, or there are no material qualities in Him, but He is full of transcendental qualities. In the transcendental world there is nothing contradictory, whereas in the relative world everything has its opposite. In the relative world white is the opposite conception of black, but in the transcendental world there is no distinction between white and black. Therefore the sounds of benedictions uttered by the learned brähmaëas here and there appear to be contradictory in relation with the Absolute Person, but when they are applied to the Absolute Person they lose all contradiction and become transcendental. One example may clear this idea. Lord Çré Kåñëa is sometimes described as a thief. He is very famous amongst His pure devotees as the Mäkhana-cora. He used to steal butter from the houses of neighbors at Våndävana in His early age. Since then He is famous as a thief. But in spite of His being famous as a thief, He is worshiped as a thief, whereas in the mundane world a thief is punished and is never praised. Since He is the Absolute Personality of Godhead, everything is applicable to Him, and still in spite of all contradictions He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
