            "content": "As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, all the Vedic literatures are glorifying the greatness of Lord Çré Kåñëa. Here it is confirmed in the Bhägavatam also. The Vedas are expanded by many branches and subbranches by great devotees and empowered incarnations of the Lord like Vyäsa, Närada, Çukadeva Gosvämé, the Kumäras, Kapila, Prahläda, Janaka, Bali and Yamaräja, but in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam especially, the confidential parts of His activities are described by the confidential devotee Çukadeva Gosvämé. In the Vedänta-sütras or Upaniñads there is only a hint of the confidential parts of His pastimes. In such Vedic literatures as the Upaniñads, the Lord has expressively been distinguished from the mundane conception of His existence. His identity being fully spiritual, His form, name, quality, and paraphernalia, etc., have been elaborately distinguished from matter, and therefore He is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent persons as impersonal. But factually He is the Supreme Person, Bhagavän, and He is partially represented as Paramätmä or impersonal Brahman."
