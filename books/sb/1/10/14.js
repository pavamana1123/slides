            "content": "There were hundreds of ladies in the palace of Hastinäpura. All of them were affectionate to Kåñëa. All of them were relatives also. When they saw that Kåñëa was going away from the palace for His native place, they were very anxious for Him, and as usual tears began to roll down their cheeks. They thought, at the same time, that tears at that moment might be a cause of misfortune for Kåñëa; therefore they wanted to check them. This was very difficult for them because the tears could not be checked. Therefore, they smeared their tears in their eyes, and their hearts throbbed. Therefore ladies who were the wives and daughters-in-law of those who died in the battlefield never came in direct contact with Kåñëa. But all of them heard of Him and His great activities, and thus they thought of Him, talked of Him, His name, fame, etc., and became affectionate also, like those who were in direct contact. Therefore directly or indirectly anyone who thinks of Kåñëa, talks of Kåñëa or worships Kåñëa becomes attached to Him. Because Kåñëa is absolute, there is no difference between His name, form, quality, etc. Our intimate relation with Kåñëa can be confidentially revived by our talking of, hearing of, or remembering Him. It is so done due to spiritual potency."
