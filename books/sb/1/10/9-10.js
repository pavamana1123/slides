            "content": "Lord Çré Kåñëa is so attractive for the living beings, especially for the devotees, that it is impossible for them to tolerate separation. The conditioned soul under the spell of illusory energy forgets the Lord, otherwise he cannot. The feeling of such separation cannot be described, but it can simply be imagined by devotees only. After His separation from Våndävana and the innocent rural cowherd boys, girls, ladies and others, they all felt shock throughout their lives, and the separation of Rädhäräëé, the most beloved cowherd girl, is beyond expression. Once they met at Kurukñetra during a solar eclipse, and the feeling which was expressed by them is heartrending. There is, of course, a difference in the qualities of the transcendental devotees of the Lord, but none of them who have ever contacted the Lord by direct communion or otherwise can leave Him for a moment. That is the attitude of the pure devotee."
