    "translation": "O Çaunaka, the Lord then proceeded towards Kurujäìgala, Päïcälä, Çürasenä, the land on the bank of the River Yamunä, Brahmävarta, Kurukñetra, Matsyä, Särasvatä, the province of the desert and the land of scanty water. After crossing these provinces He gradually reached the Sauvéra and Äbhéra provinces, then west of these, reached Dvärakä at last.",

            "content": "The provinces passed over by the Lord in those days were differently named, but the direction given is sufficient to indicate that He traveled through Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Saurastra and Gujarat and at last reached His home province at Dvärakä. We do not gain any profit simply by researching the analogous provinces of those days up to now, but it appears that the desert of Rajasthan and the provinces of scanty water like Madhya Pradesh were present even five thousand years ago. The theory of soil experts that the desert developed in recent years is not supported by the statements of Bhägavatam. We may leave the matter for expert geologists to research because the changing universe has different phases of geological development. We are satisfied that the Lord has now reached His own province, Dvärakädhäma, from the Kuru provinces. Kurukñetra continues to exist since the Vedic age, and it is sheer foolishness when interpreters ignore or deny the existence of Kurukñetra."
