            "content": "Exceptionally qualified daughters of powerful kings were allowed to make a choice of their own bridegrooms in open competition, and such ceremonies were called svayaàvara, or selection of the bridegroom. Because the svayaàvara was an open competition between the rival and valiant princes, such princes were invited by the father of the princess, and usually there were regular fights between the invited princely order in a sporting spirit. But it so happened that sometimes the belligerent princes were killed in such marriage-fighting, and the victorious prince was offered the trophy princess for whom so many princes died. Rukmiëé, the principal queen of Lord Kåñëa, was the daughter of the King of Vidarbha, who wished that his qualified and beautiful daughter be given away to Lord Kåñëa. But her eldest brother wanted her to be given away to King Çiçupäla, who happened to be a cousin of Kåñëa. So there was open competition, and as usual Lord Kåñëa emerged successful, after harassing Çiçupäla and other princes by His unrivalled prowess. Rukmiëé had ten sons, like Pradyumna. There were other queens also taken away by Lord Kåñëa in a similar way. Full description of this beautiful booty of Lord Kåñëa will be given in the Tenth Canto. There were 16,100 beautiful girls who were daughters of many kings and were forcibly stolen by Bhaumäsura, who kept them captive for his carnal desire. These girls prayed piteously to Lord Kåñëa for their deliverance, and the merciful Lord, called by their fervent prayer, released them all by fighting and killing Bhaumäsura. All these captive princesses were then accepted by the Lord as His wives, although in the estimation of society they were all fallen girls. The all-powerful Lord Kåñëa accepted the humble prayers of these girls and married them with the adoration of queens. So altogether Lord Kåñëa had 16,108 queens at Dvärakä, and in each of them He begot ten children. All these children grew up, and each had as many children as the father. The aggregate of the family numbered 10,000,000."
