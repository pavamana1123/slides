He was the son of Mahäräja Avikñit and was a great devotee of the son of the sun-god, known as Yamaräja. His brother Samvarta was a rival priest of the great Båhaspati, the learned priest of the demigods. He conducted one sacrifice called Saìkära-yajïa by which the Lord was so satisfied that He was pleased to hand over to him the charge of a mountain peak of gold. This peak of gold is somewhere in the Himalaya Mountains, and modern adventurers may try to find it there. He was so powerful an emperor that at the day's end of sacrifice, the demigods from the other planets like Indra, Candra and Båhaspati used to visit his palace. And because he had the gold peak at his disposal, he had sufficient gold in his possession. The canopy of the sacrificial altar was completely made of gold. in his daily performances of the sacrificial ceremonies, some of the inhabitants of the Väyuloka (airy planets) were invited to expedite the cooking work of the ceremony. And the assembly of the demigods in the ceremony was led by Viçvadeva."

All the inhabitants of higher planets like Devaloka and Pitåloka were pleased with him for his great sacrificial ceremonies. Every day he used to give in charity to the learned brähmaëas such things as beddings, seats, conveyances and sufficient quantities of gold. Because of munificent charities and performances of innumerable sacrifices, the King of heaven, Indradeva, was fully satisfied with him and always wished for his welfare. Due to his pious activities, he remained a young man throughout his life and reigned over the world for one thousand years, surrounded by his satisfied subjects, ministers, legitimate wife, sons and brothers. Even Lord Çré Kåñëa praised his spirit of pious activities. He handed over his only daughter to Maharñi Aìgirä, and by his good blessings, he was elevated to the kingdom of heaven. First of all, he wanted to offer the priesthood of his sacrifices to learned Båhaspati, but the demigod refused to accept the post because of the King's being a human being, a man of this earth. He was very sorry for this, but on the advice of Närada Muni he appointed Samvarta to the post, and he was successful in his mission."

            "content": "The success of a particular type of sacrifice completely depends on the priest in charge. In this age, all kinds of sacrifice are forbidden because there is no learned priest amongst the so-called brähmaëas, who go by the false notion of becoming sons of brähmaëas without brahminical qualifications. In this age of Kali, therefore, only one kind of sacrifice is recommended, saìkértana-yajïa, as inaugurated by Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu."
