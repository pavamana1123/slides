He therefore took all the responsibility for sins committed in the warfare, and to get rid of all these sins, he wanted to perform three sacrifices in which horses are offered at the altar. Such a sacrifice is very costly. Even Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira had to collect the necessary heaps of gold left by Mahäräja Marutta and the brähmaëas who were given gold in charity by King Marutta. The learned brähmaëas could not take away all the loads of gold given by Mahäräja Marutta, and therefore they left behind the major portion of the gift. And Mahäräja Marutta also did not again collect such heaps of gold given away in charity. Besides that, all the golden plates and utensils which were used in the sacrifice were also thrown in the dustbins, and all such heaps of gold remained unclaimed property for a long time, till Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira collected them for his own purposes. Lord Çré Kåñëa advised the brothers of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira to collect the unclaimed property because it belonged to the King. The more astonishing thing is that no subject of the state also collected such unclaimed gold for industrial enterprise or anything like that. This means that the state citizens were completely satisfied with all necessities of life and therefore not inclined to accept unnecessary productive enterprises for sense gratification. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira also requisitioned the heaps of gold for performing sacrifices and for pleasing the Supreme Hari Personality of Godhead. Otherwise he had no desire to collect them for the state treasury."

This indicates that unintentional sins are also committed in our daily occupational discharge of duties, and to counteract even such unintentional crimes, one must perform sacrifices as they are recommended in the revealed scriptures. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (yajïärthät karmaëo 'nyatra loko 'yaà karma-bandhanaù ) that one must perform sacrifices recommended in the scriptures in order to get rid of commitments of all unauthorized work, or even unintentional crimes which we are apt to commit. By doing so, one shall be freed from all kinds of sins. And those who do not do so but work for self-interest or sense gratification have to undergo all tribulations accrued from committed sins. Therefore, the main purpose of performing sacrifices is to satisfy the Supreme Personality Hari. The process of performing sacrifices may be different in terms of different times, places and persons, but the aim of such sacrifices is one and the same at all times and in all circumstances, viz. , satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Hari. That is the way of pious life, and that is the way of peace and prosperity in the world at large. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira did all these as the ideal pious king in the world."

The Bhägavatam says, therefore, that the prime duty of the human being is to satisfy the Supreme Lord by the performance of one's occupational duty ."

In the Vedic literatures it is recommended that in Kali-yuga people engage in glorifying the Lord by chanting the holy name of Kåñëa (kértanäd eva kåñëasya mukta-saìgaù paraà vrajet ) without offense. By doing so one can be freed from all sins and thus can attain the highest perfection of life by returning home, back to Godhead. We have already discussed this more than once in this great literature in different places, especially in the introductory portion by sketching the life of Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, and still we are repeating the same with a view to bring about peace and prosperity in society."

At the present moment we have heaps of papers and promises of their being converted into gold by economic development of modern civilization, and still there is no possibility of spending riches like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, either individually or collectively or by state patronization. Just suitable, therefore, for the age, is the method recommended by Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu in terms of the çästra. Such a method requires no expenditure at all and yet can award more benefit than other expensive methods of yajïa performances."
