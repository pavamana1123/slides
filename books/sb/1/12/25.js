Bali Mahäräja is a great authority in devotional service because he sacrificed everything to please the Lord and relinquished the connection of his so-called spiritual master who obstructed him on the path of risking everything for the service of the Lord. The highest perfection of religious life is to attain to the stage of unqualified devotional service of the Lord without any cause or without being obstructed by any kind of worldly obligation. Bali Mahäräja was determined to give up everything for the satisfaction of the Lord, and he did not care for any obstruction whatsoever. He is the grandson of Prahläda Mahäräja, another authority in the devotional service of the Lord. Bali Mahäräja and the history of his dealings with Viñëu Vämanadeva are described in the Eighth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam ."

His father, Hiraëyakaçipu, chastised him severely when he was only five years old for his becoming an unalloyed devotee of the Lord. He was the first son of Hiraëyakaçipu, and his mother's name was Kayädhu. Prahläda Mahäräja was an authority in the devotional service of the Lord because he had his father killed by Lord Nåsiàhadeva, setting the example that even a father should be removed from the path of devotional service if such a father happens to be an obstacle. He had four sons, and the eldest son, Virocana, is the father of Bali Mahäräja, mentioned above. The history of Prahläda Mahäräja's activities is described in the Seventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam."
