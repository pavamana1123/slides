            "content": "A king becomes famous by his acts of charity, performances of yajïas, protection of the surrendered, etc. A kñatriya king is proud to give protection to the surrendered souls. This attitude of a king is called éçvara-bhava, or factual power to give protection in a righteous cause. In the Bhagavad-gétä the Lord instructs living beings to surrender unto Him, and He promises all protection. The Lord is all-powerful and true to His word, and therefore He never fails to give protection to His different devotees. The king, being the representative of the Lord, must possess this attitude of giving protection to the surrendered souls at all risk. Mahäräja Çibi, the King of Uçénara, was an intimate friend of Mahäräja Yayäti, who was able to reach the heavenly planets along with Mahäräja Çibi. Mahäräja Çibi was aware of the heavenly planet where he was to be transferred after his death, and the description of this heavenly planet is given in the Mahäbhärata (Adi-parva 96.6-9). Mahäräja Çibi was so charitably disposed that he wanted to give over his acquired position in the heavenly kingdom to Yayäti, but he did not accept it. Yayäti went to the heavenly planet along with great åñis like Añöaka and others. On inquiry from the åñis, Yayäti gave an account of Çibi's pious acts when all of them were on the path to heaven. He has become a member of the assembly of Yamaräja, who has become his worshipful deity. As confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä, the worshiper of the demigods goes to the planets of the demigods (yänti deva-vratä devän ); so Mahäräja Çibi has become an associate of the great Vaiñëava authority Yamaräja on that particular planet. While he was on the earth he became very famous as a protector of surrendered souls and a donor of charities. The King of heaven once took the shape of a pigeon-hunter bird (eagle), and Agni, the fire-god, took the shape of a pigeon. The pigeon, while being chased by the eagle, took shelter on the lap of Mahäräja Çibi, and the hunter eagle wanted the pigeon back from the King. The King wanted to give it some other meat to eat and requested the bird not to kill the pigeon. The hunter bird refused to accept the King's offer, but it was settled later on that the eagle would accept flesh from the body of the King of the pigeon's equivalent weight. The King began to cut flesh from his body to weigh in the balance equivalent to the weight of the pigeon, but the mystic pigeon always remained heavier. The King then put himself on the balance to equate with the pigeon, and the demigods were pleased with him. The King of heaven and the fire-god disclosed their identity, and the King was blessed by them. Devarñi Närada also glorified Mahäräja Çibi for his great achievements, specifically in charity and protection. Mahäräja Çibi sacrificed his own son for the satisfaction of human beings in his kingdom. And thus child Parékñit was to become a second Çibi in charity and protection."

And all these Bharatas are historically known to the universe. This earth planet is known as Bhärata, or Bhärata-varña, due to King Bharata the son of Åñabha, but according to some this land is known as Bhärata due to the reign of the son of Duñyanta. So far as we are convinced, this land's name Bhärata-varña was established from the reign of Bharata the son of King Åñabha. Before him the land was known as Ilävati-varña, but just after the coronation of Bharata, the son of Åñabha, this land became famous as Bhärata-varña."

            "content": "But despite all this, Bharata, the son of Mahäräja Duñyanta was not less important. He is the son of the famous beauty Çakuntalä. Mahäräja Duñyanta fell in love with Çakuntalä in the forest, and Bharata was conceived. After that, Mahäräja forgot his wife Çakuntalä by the curse of Kaëva Muni, and the child Bharata was brought up in the forest by his mother. Even in his childhood he was so powerful that he challenged the lions and elephants in the forest and would fight with them as little children play with cats and dogs. Because of the boy's becoming so strong, more than the so-called modern Tarzan, the åñis in the forest called him Sarvadaman, or one who is able to control everyone. A full description of Mahäräja Bharata is given in the Mahäbhärata, Adi-parva. The Päëòavas, or the Kurus, are sometimes addressed as Bhärata due to being born in the dynasty of the famous Mahäräja Bharata, the son of King Duñyanta."
