In other words, the Vedas are the guides for the civilized man in every respect. Since human life is the opportunity to get free from all material miseries, it is properly guided by the knowledge of the Vedas, in the matters of both material needs and spiritual salvation. The specific intelligent class of men who were devoted particularly to the knowledge of the Vedas were called the vipras, or the graduates of the Vedic knowledge. There are different branches of knowledge in the Vedas, of which astrology and pathology are two important branches necessary for the common man. So the intelligent men, generally known as the brähmaëas, took up all the different branches of Vedic knowledge to guide society. Even the department of military education (Dhanur-veda) was also taken up by such intelligent men, and the vipras were also teachers of this section of knowledge, as were Droëäcärya, Kåpäcärya, etc."

            "content": "The word vipra mentioned herein is significant. There is a little difference between the vipras and the brähmaëas. The vipras are those who are expert in karma-käëòa, or fruitive activities, guiding the society towards fulfilling the material necessities of life, whereas the brähmaëas are expert in spiritual knowledge of transcendence. This department of knowledge is called jïäna-käëòa, and above this there is the upäsanä-käëòa. The culmination of upäsanä-käëòa is the devotional service of the Lord Viñëu, and when the brähmaëas achieve perfection, they are called Vaiñëavas. Viñëu worship is the highest of the modes of worship. Elevated brähmaëas are Vaiñëavas engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, and thus Çrémad-Bhägavatam, which is the science of devotional service, is very dear to the Vaiñëavas. And as explained in the beginning of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, it is the mature fruit of Vedic knowledge and is superior subject matter, above the three käëòas, namely karma, jïäna and upäsanä."

Such expert jätaka-vipras were present during the birth of Mahäräja Parékñit, and his grandfather, Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, awarded the vipras sufficiently with gold, land, villages, grains and other valuable necessaries of life, which also include cows. There is a need of such vipras in the social structure, and it is the duty of the state to maintain them comfortably, as designed in the Vedic procedure. Such expert vipras, being sufficiently paid by the state, could give free service to the people in general, and thus this department of Vedic knowledge could be available for all."
