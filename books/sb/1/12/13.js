            "content": "There is a need for a good and intelligent class of brähmaëas who are expert in performing the purificatory processes prescribed in the system of varëäçrama-dharma. Unless such purificatory processes are performed, there is no possibility of good population, and in the age of Kali the population all over the world is of çüdra quality or lower for want of this purificatory process. It is not possible, however, to revive the Vedic process of purification in this age, for want of proper facilities and good brähmaëas, but there is the Päïcarätrika system also recommended for this age. The Päïcarätrika system acts on the çüdra class of men, supposedly the population of the Kali-yuga, and it is the prescribed purificatory process suitable to the age and time. Such a purificatory process is allowed only for spiritual upliftment and not for any other purpose. Spiritual upliftment is never conditioned by higher or lower parentage."

            "content": "After the garbhädhäna purificatory process, there are certain other saàskäras like sémantonnayana, sadhabhakñaëam, etc., during the period of pregnancy, and when the child is born the first purificatory process is jätakarman. This was performed duly by Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira with the help of good and learned brähmaëas like Dhaumya, the royal priest, and Kåpäcärya, who was not only a priest but also a great general. Both these learned and perfect priests, assisted by other good brähmaëas, were employed by Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira to perform the ceremony. Therefore all the saàskäras, purificatory processes, are not mere formalities or social functions only, but they are all for practical purposes and can be successfully performed by expert brähmaëas like Dhaumya and Kåpa. Such brähmaëas are not only rare, but also not available in this age, and therefore, for the purpose of spiritual upliftment in this fallen age, the Gosvämés prefer the purificatory processes under Päïcarätrika formulas to the Vedic rites."

            "content": "Kåpäcärya is the son of the great Åñi Sardban and was born in the family of Gautama. The birth is said to be accidental. By chance, the great Åñi Sardban met Janapadé, a famous society girl of heaven, and the Åñi Sardban discharged semina in two parts. By one part immediately a male child and by the other part a female child were born as twins. The male child was later on known as Kåpa, and the female child was known as Kåpé. Mahäräja Çantanu, while engaged in chase in the jungle, picked up the children and brought them up to the brahminical status by the proper purificatory process. Kåpäcärya later became a great general like Droëäcärya, and his sister was married to Droëäcärya. Kåpäcärya later on took part in the Battle of Kurukñetra and joined the party of Duryodhana. Kåpäcärya helped kill Abhimanyu, the father of Mahäräja Parékñit, but he was still held in esteem by the family of the Päëòavas due to his being as great a brähmaëa as Droëäcärya. When the Päëòavas were sent to the forest after being defeated in the gambling game with Duryodhana, Dhåtaräñöra entrusted the Päëòavas to Kåpäcärya for guidance. After the end of the battle, Kåpäcärya again became a member of the royal assembly, and he was called during the birth of Mahäräja Parékñit for recitation of auspicious Vedic hymns to make the ceremony successful. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, while quitting the palace for his great departure to the Himalayas, entrusted Kåpäcärya with Mahäräja Parékñit as his disciple, and he left home satisfied because of Kåpäcärya's taking charge of Mahäräja Parékñit. The great administrators, kings and emperors were always under the guidance of learned brähmaëas like Kåpäcärya and thus were able to act properly in the discharge of political responsibilities."
