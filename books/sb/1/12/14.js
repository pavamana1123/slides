In all the different occasions of saàskäras, especially during the time of birth, marriage and death, wealth is distributed to the brähmaëas because the brähmaëas give the highest quality of service in regard to the prime necessity of humankind. The charity was substantial in the shape of gold, land, villages, horses, elephants and food grains, with other materials for cooking complete foodstuff. The brähmaëas were not, therefore, poor in the actual sense of the term. On the contrary, because they possessed gold, land, villages, horses, elephants and sufficient grains, they had nothing to earn for themselves. They would simply devote themselves to the well-being of the entire society."

            "content": "The word térthavit is significant because the King knew well where and when charity has to be given. Charity is never unproductive or blind. In the çästras charity was offered to persons who deserve to accept charity by dint of spiritual enlightenment. The so-called daridra-näräyaëa, a misconception of the Supreme Lord by unauthorized persons, is never to be found in the çästras as the object of charity. Nor can a wretched poor man receive much munificent charity in the way of horses, elephants, land and villages. The conclusion is that the intelligent men, or the brähmaëas specifically engaged in the service of the Lord, were properly maintained without anxiety for the needs of the body, and the King and other householders gladly looked after all their comforts."

The administrative demigods and past forefathers of the family come to see a newly born child, and such an occasion is specifically accepted as the proper time for distributing wealth to the right persons productively for the spiritual advancement of society."
