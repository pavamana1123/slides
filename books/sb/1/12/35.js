Simply taking birth in the family of a brähmaëa does not make one qualified to perform yajïas. One must be twice-born by proper training and initiation from the bona fide äcärya. The once-born scions of brähmaëa families are equal with the once-born çüdras, and such brahma-bandhus, or unqualified once-born scions, must be rejected for any purpose of religious or Vedic function. Lord Çré Kåñëa was entrusted to look after this arrangement, and perfect as He is, He caused the yajïas to be performed by the bona fide twice-born brähmaëas for successful execution."
