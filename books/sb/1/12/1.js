His arrival at Dvärakä and residing with the sixteen thousand queens, etc., were narrated. The sages were absorbed in hearing such descriptions, but now they wanted to turn to the original topic, and thus the inquiry was made by Çaunaka Åñi. So the subject of the release of the brahmästra weapon by Açvatthämä is renewed."
