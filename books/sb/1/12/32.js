After the Battle of Kurukñetra the state treasury was exhausted, and therefore there was no surplus fund except the fund from tax collection and fines. Such funds were sufficient only for the state budget, and having no excess fund, the King was anxious to get more wealth in some other way in order to perform the horse sacrifice. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira wanted to perform this sacrifice under the instruction of Bhéñmadeva."
