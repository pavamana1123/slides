    "translation": "This child will be like his grandfather Yudhiñöhira or Brahmä in equanimity of mind. He will be munificent like the lord of the Kailäsa Hill, Çiva. And he will be the resort of everyone, like the Supreme Personality of Godhead Näräyaëa, who is even the shelter of the goddess of fortune.",

            "content": "Mental equanimity refers both to Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and to Brahmä, the grandfather of all living beings. According to Çrédhara Svämé, the grandfather referred to is Brahmä, but according to Viçvanätha Cakravarté, the grandfather is Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira himself. But in both cases the comparison is equally good because both of them are recognized representatives of the Supreme Lord, and thus both of them have to maintain mental equanimity, being engaged in welfare work for the living being. Any responsible executive agent at the top of administration has to tolerate different types of onslaughts from the very persons for whom he works. Brahmäjé was criticized even by the gopés, the highest perfectional devotees of the Lord. The gopés were dissatisfied with the work of Brahmäjé because Lord Brahmä, as creator of this particular universe, created eyelids which obstructed their seeing Lord Kåñëa. They could not tolerate a moment's blinking of the eyes, for it kept them from seeing their beloved Lord Kåñëa. So what to speak of others, who are naturally very critical of every action of a responsible man? Similarly, Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira had to cross over many difficult situations created by his enemies, and he proved to be the most perfect maintainer of mental equanimity in all critical circumstances. Therefore the example of both grandfathers for maintaining equanimity of mind is quite fitting."

            "content": "Lord Çiva is a celebrated demigod who awards gifts to beggars. His name is therefore Äçutoña, or one who is pleased very easily. He is also called the Bhütanätha, or the lord of the common folk, who are mainly attached to him because of his munificent gifts, even without consideration of the aftereffects. Rävaëa was very attached to Lord Çiva, and by easily pleasing him, Rävaëa became so powerful that he wanted to challenge the authority of Lord Räma. Of course, Rävaëa was never helped by Lord Çiva when he fought with Räma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Lord of Lord Çiva. To Våkäsura, Lord Çiva awarded a benediction which was not only awkward, but also disturbing. Våkäsura became empowered, by the grace of Lord Çiva, to vanish anyone's head simply by touching it. Although this was awarded by Lord Çiva, the cunning fellow wanted to make an experiment of the power by touching the head of Lord Çiva. Thus the lord had to take shelter of Viñëu to save himself from trouble, and the Lord Viñëu, by His illusory potency, asked Våkäsura to make an experiment with his own head. The fellow did it and was finished himself, and so the world was saved from all sorts of trouble by such a cunning beggar of the demigods. The excellent point is that Lord Çiva never denies anyone any sort of gift. He is therefore the most generous, although sometimes some kind of a mistake is made."

            "content": "Ramä means the goddess of fortune. And her shelter is Lord Viñëu. Lord Viñëu is the maintainer of all living beings. There are innumerable living beings, not only on the surface of this planet but also in all other hundreds of thousands of planets. All of them are provided with all necessities of life for the progressive march towards the end of self-realization, but on the path of sense gratification they are put into difficulty by the agency of mäyä, the illusory energy, and so travel the path of a false plan of economic development. Such economic development is never successful because it is illusory. These men are always after the mercy of the illusory goddess of fortune, but they do not know that the goddess of fortune can live only under the protection of Viñëu. Without Viñëu, the goddess of fortune is an illusion. We should therefore seek the protection of Viñëu instead of directly seeking the protection of the goddess of fortune. Only Viñëu and the devotees of Viñëu can give protection to all, and because Mahäräja Parékñit was himself protected by Viñëu, it was quite possible for him to give complete protection to all who wanted to live under his rule."
