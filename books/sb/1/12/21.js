Both the Arjunas are famous for their bowmanship, and the child Parékñit is foretold to be equal to both of them, particularly in fighting. A short description of the Päëòava Arjuna is given below:"

Queen Kuntédevé could call for any one of the demigods, and thus she called Indra, and Arjuna was born by him. Arjuna is therefore a plenary part of the heavenly King Indra. He was born in the month of Phalguna (February-March), and therefore he is also called Phalguni. When he appeared as the son of Kunté, his future greatness was proclaimed by air messages, and all the important personalities from different parts of the universe, such as the demigods, the Gandharvas, the Adityas (from the sun globe), the Rudras, the Vasus, the Nägas, the different åñis (sages) of importance, and the Apsaräs (the society girls of heaven), all attended the ceremony. The Apsaräs pleased everyone by their heavenly dances and songs. Vasudeva, the father of Lord Kåñëa and the maternal uncle of Arjuna, sent his priest representative Kaçyapa to purify Arjuna by all the prescribed saàskäras, or reformatory processes. His saàskära of being given a name was performed in the presence of the åñis, residents of Çatasåìga. He married four wives, Draupadé, Subhadrä, Citräìgadä and Ulüpé, from whom he got four sons of the names Çrutakérti, Abhimanyu, Babhruvähana and Irävän respectively."

But he excelled everyone by his studious intensity, and Droëäcärya was especially attracted by his disciplinary affection. Droëäcärya accepted him as a first-grade scholar and loved heartily to bestow upon him all the blessings of military science. He was so ardent a student that he used to practice bowmanship even at night, and for all these reasons Professor Droëäcärya was determined to make him the topmost bowman of the world. He passed very brilliantly the examination in piercing the target, and Droëäcärya was very pleased. Royal families at Maëipur and Tripura are descendants of Arjuna's son Babhruvähana. Arjuna saved Droëäcärya from the attack of a crocodile, and the Äcärya, being pleased with him, rewarded him with a weapon of the name brahmaçira. Mahäräja Drupada was inimical toward Droëäcärya, and thus when he attacked the Äcärya, Arjuna got him arrested and brought him before Droëäcärya. He besieged a city of the name Ahichhatra, belonging to Mahäräja Drupada, and after taking it over he gave it to Droëäcärya. The confidential treatment of the weapon brahmaçira was explained to Arjuna, and Droëäcärya was promised by Arjuna that he would use the weapon if necessary when he (Droëäcärya) personally became an enemy of Arjuna. By this, the Äcärya forecasted the future battle of Kurukñetra, in which Droëäcärya was on the opposite side. Mahäräja Drupada, although defeated by Arjuna on behalf of his professor Droëäcärya, decided to hand over his daughter Draupadé to his young combatant, but he was disappointed when he heard the false news of Arjuna's death in the fire of a shellac house intrigued by Duryodhana. He therefore arranged for Draupadé's personal selection of a groom who could pierce the eye of a fish hanging on the ceiling. This trick was especially made because only Arjuna could do it, and he was successful in his desire to hand over his equally worthy daughter to Arjuna. Arjuna's brothers were at that time living incognito under agreement with Duryodhana, and Arjuna and his brothers attended the meeting of Draupadé's selection in the dress of brähmaëas. When all the kñatriya kings assembled saw that a poor brähmaëa had been garlanded by Draupadé for her lord, Çré Kåñëa disclosed his identity to Balaräma."

Similarly, he met Citräìgadä, a daughter of the King of Maëipura, and thus Babhruvähana was born. Lord Çré Kåñëa made a plan to help Arjuna to kidnap Subhadrä, sister of Çré Kåñëa, because Baladeva was inclined to hand her over to Duryodhana. Yudhiñöhira also agreed with Çré Kåñëa, and thus Subhadrä was taken by force by Arjuna and then married to him. Subhadrä's son is Abhimanyu, the father of Parékñit Mahäräja, the posthumous child. Arjuna satisfied the fire-god by setting fire to the Khäëòava Forest, and thus the fire-god gave him one weapon. Indra was angry when the fire was set in the Khäëòava Forest, and thus Indra, assisted by all other demigods, began fighting with Arjuna for his great challenge. They were defeated by Arjuna, and Indradeva returned to his heavenly kingdom. Arjuna also promised all protection to one Mayäsura, and the latter presented him one valuable conchshell celebrated as the Devadatta. Similarly, he received many other valuable weapons from Indradeva when he was satisfied to see his chivalry."

When he went out to bring all other kings of the world under the subjection of the Päëòavas, as was usual after the coronation of every emperor, he conquered the country named Kelinda and brought in subjugation King Bhagdutt. Then he traveled through countries like Antagiri, Ulukpur and Modapur and brought under subjugation all the rulers."

Lord Çiva also wanted to try the strength of Arjuna, and in the form of an aborigine, Lord Çiva met him. There was a great fight between the two, and at last Lord Çiva was satisfied with him and disclosed his identity. Arjuna prayed to the lord in all humbleness, and the lord, being pleased with him, presented him the paçupata weapon. He acquired many other important weapons from different demigods. He received daëòästra from Yamaräja, paçästra from Varuëa, and antardhana-astra from Kuvera, the treasurer of the heavenly kingdom. Indra wanted him to come to the heavenly kingdom, the Indraloka planet beyond the moon planet. In that planet he was cordially received by the local residents, and he was awarded reception in the heavenly parliament of Indradeva. Then he met Indradeva, who not only presented him with his vajra weapon, but also taught him the military and musical science as used in the heavenly planet. In one sense, Indra is the real father of Arjuna, and therefore indirectly he wanted to entertain Arjuna with the famous society girl of heaven, Urvaçé, the celebrated beauty. The society girls of heaven are lusty, and Urvaçé was very eager to contact Arjuna, the strongest human being. She met him in his room and expressed her desires but Arjuna sustained his unimpeachable character by closing his eyes before Urvaçé, addressing her as mother of the Kuru dynasty and placing her in the category of his mothers Kunté, Mädré and Çacédevé, wife of Indradeva. Disappointed, Urvaçé cursed Arjuna and left. In the heavenly planet he also met the great celebrated ascetic Lomasa and prayed to him for the protection of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira."

When all the Päëòavas lived incognito, he presented himself in the court of King Viräöa as a eunuch and was employed as the musical teacher of Uttarä, his future daughter-in-law, and was known in the Viräöa court as the Båhannala. As Båhannala, he fought on behalf of Uttara, the son of King Viräöa, and thus defeated the Kurus in the fight incognito. His secret weapons were safely kept in the custody of a somi tree, and he ordered Uttara to get them back. His identity and his brothers' identity were later on disclosed to Uttara. Droëäcärya was informed of Arjuna's presence in the fight of the Kurus and the Viräöas. Later, on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, Arjuna killed many great generals like Karëa and others. After the Battle of Kurukñetra, he punished Açvatthämä, who had killed all the five sons of Draupadé. Then all the brothers went to Bhéñmadeva."

His wonderful acts on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra are vividly described in the Mahäbhärata. Arjuna was defeated, however, by his son Babhruvähana at Maëipura and fell unconscious when Ulüpé saved him. After the disappearance of Lord Kåñëa, the message was brought by Arjuna to Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. Again, Arjuna visited Dvärakä, and all the widow wives of Lord Kåñëa lamented before him. He took them all in the presence of Vasudeva and pacified all of them. Later on, when Vasudeva passed away, he performed his funeral ceremony in the absence of Kåñëa. While Arjuna was taking all the wives of Kåñëa to Indraprastha, he was attacked on the way, and he could not protect the ladies in his custody. At last, advised by Vyäsadeva, all the brothers headed for Mahäprasthan. On the way, at the request of his brother, he gave up all important weapons as useless, and he dropped them all in the water."
