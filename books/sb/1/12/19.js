            "content": "Prajä means the living being who has taken his birth in the material world. Actually the living being has no birth and no death, but because of his separation from the service of the Lord and due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is offered a suitable body to satisfy his material desires. In doing so, one becomes conditioned by the laws of material nature, and the material body is changed in terms of his own work. The living entity thus transmigrates from one body to another in 8,400,000 species of life. But due to his being the part and parcel of the Lord, he not only is maintained with all necessaries of life by the Lord, but also is protected by the Lord and His representatives, the saintly kings. These saintly kings give protection to all the prajäs, or living beings, to live and to fulfill their terms of imprisonment. Mahäräja Parékñit was actually an ideal saintly king because while touring his kingdom he happened to see that a poor cow was about to be killed by the personified Kali, whom he at once took to task as a murderer. This means that even the animals were given protection by the saintly administrators, not from any sentimental point of view, but because those who have taken their birth in the material world have the right to live. All the saintly kings, beginning from the King of the sun globe down to the King of the earth, are so inclined by the influence of the Vedic literatures. The Vedic literatures are taught in higher planets also, as there is reference in the Bhagavad-gétä  about the teachings to the sun-god (Vivasvän) by the Lord, and such lessons are transferred by disciplic succession, as it was done by the sun-god to his son Manu, and from Manu to Mahäräja Ikñväku. There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahmä, and the Manu referred to herein is the seventh Manu, who is one of the prajäpatis (those who create progeny), and he is the son of the sun-god. He is known as the Vaivasvata Manu. He had ten sons, and Mahäräja Ikñväku is one of them. Mahäräja Ikñväku also learned bhakti-yoga as taught in the Bhagavad-gétä from his father, Manu, who got it from his father, the sun-god. Later on the teaching of the Bhagavad-gétä came down by disciplic succession from Mahäräja Ikñväku, but in course of time the chain was broken by unscrupulous persons, and therefore it again had to be taught to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra. So all the Vedic literatures are current from the very beginning of creation of the material world, and thus the Vedic literatures are known as apauruñeya (not made by man). The Vedic knowledge was spoken by the Lord and first heard by Brahmä, the first created living being within the universe."

Mankind is the descendant of Manu. This Vaivasvata Manu had ten sons, named Ikñväku, Nabhaga, Dhåñöa, Çaryäti, Nariñyanta, Näbhäga, Diñöa, Karüña, Påñadhra and Vasumän. The Lord's incarnation Matsya (the gigantic fish) was advented during the beginning of Vaivasvata Manu's reign. He learned the principles of Bhagavad-gétä from his father, Vivasvän, the sun-god, and he reinstructed the same to his son Mahäräja Ikñväku. In the beginning of the Tretä-yuga the sun-god instructed devotional service to Manu, and Manu in his turn instructed it to Ikñväku for the welfare of the whole human society."

Lord Räma descended along with His plenary portions, and all of them appeared as His younger brothers. In the month of Caitra on the ninth day of the growing moon in the Tretä-yuga, the Lord appeared, as usual, to establish the principles of religion and to annihilate the disturbing elements. When He was just a young boy, He helped the great sage Viçvämitra by killing Subahu and striking Märéca, the she-demon, who was disturbing the sages in their daily discharge of duties. The brähmaëas and kñatriyas are meant to cooperate for the welfare of the mass of people. The brähmaëa sages endeavor to enlighten the people by perfect knowledge, and the kñatriyas are meant for their protection. Lord Rämacandra is the ideal king for maintaining and protecting the highest culture of humanity, known as brahmaëya-dharma. The Lord is specifically the protector of the cows and the brähmaëas, and hence He enhances the prosperity of the world. He rewarded the administrative demigods by effective weapons to conquer the demons through the agency of Viçvämitra. He was present in the bow sacrifice of King Janaka, and by breaking the invincible bow of Çiva, He married Sétädevé, daughter of Mahäräja Janaka."

To help the administration of the demigods, He killed fourteen thousand demons, and by the intrigues of the demons, His wife, Sétädevé, was kidnapped by Rävaëa. He made friendship with Sugréva, who was helped by the Lord to kill Vali, brother of Sugréva. By the help of Lord Räma, Sugréva became the king of the Väëaras (a race of gorillas). The Lord built a floating bridge of stones on the Indian Ocean and reached Laìkä, the kingdom of Rävaëa, who had kidnapped Sétä. Later on Rävaëa was killed by Him, and Rävaëa's brother Vibhéñaëa was installed on the throne of Laìkä. Vibhéñaëa was one of the brothers of Rävaëa, a demon, but Lord Räma made him immortal by His blessings. On the expiry of fourteen years, after settling the affairs at Laìkä, the Lord came back to His kingdom, Ayodhyä, by flower plane. He instructed His brother Çatrughna to attack Lavëäsura, who reigned at Mathurä, and the demon was killed. He performed ten Açvamedha sacrifices, and later on He disappeared while taking a bath in the Çarayu River. The great epic Rämäyaëa is the history of Lord Räma's activities in the world, and the authoritative Rämäyaëa was written by the great poet Välméki."
