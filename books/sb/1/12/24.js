            "content": "The last instruction of Lord Çré Kåñëa in the Bhagavad-gétä is that one should give up everything and should follow in the footsteps of the Lord alone. Less intelligent persons do not agree to this great instruction of the Lord, as ill luck would have it, but one who is actually intelligent catches up this sublime instruction and is immensely benefited. Foolish people do not know that association is the cause of acquiring qualities. Association with fire makes an object hot, even in the material sense. Therefore, association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead makes one qualified like the Lord. As we have discussed previously, one can achieve seventy-eight percent of the godly qualities by the Lord's intimate association. To follow the instructions of the Lord is to associate with the Lord. The Lord is not a material object whose presence one has to feel for such association. The Lord is present everywhere and at all times. It is quite possible to have His association simply by following His instruction because the Lord and His instruction and the Lord and His name, fame, attributes and paraphernalia are all identical with Him, being absolute knowledge. Mahäräja Parékñit associated with the Lord even from the womb of his mother up to the last day of his valuable life, and thus he acquired all the essential good qualities of the Lord in all perfection."

            "content": "Rantideva: An ancient king prior to the Mahäbhärata period, referred to by Närada Muni while instructing Saïjaya, as mentioned in Mahäbhärata (Droëa-parva 67). He was a great king, liberal for hospitality and distribution of foodstuff. Even Lord Çré Kåñëa praised his acts of charity and hospitality. He was blessed by the great Vasiñöha Muni for supplying him cold water, and thus he achieved the heavenly planet. He used to supply fruits, roots and leaves to the åñis, and thus he was blessed by them with fulfillment of his desires. Although a kñatriya by birth, he never ate flesh in his life. He was especially hospitable to Vasiñöha Muni, and by his blessings only he attained the higher planetary residence. He is one of those pious kings whose names are remembered in the morning and evening."

            "content": "Yayäti: The great emperor of the world and the original forefather of all great nations of the world who belong to the Äryan and Indo-European stock. He is the son of Mahäräja Nabuña, and he became the emperor of the world due to his elder brother's becoming a great and liberated saintly mystic. He ruled over the world for several thousands of years and performed many sacrifices and pious activities recorded in history, although his early youth was very lustful and full of romantic stories. He fell in love with Devayäné, the most beloved daughter of Çukräcärya. Devayäné wished to marry him, but at first he refused to accept her because of her being a daughter of a brähmaëa. According to çästras, a brähmaëa could marry the daughter of a kñatriya but a kñatriya could not marry the daughter of a brähmaëa. They were very much cautious about varëa-saìkara population in the world. Çukräcärya amended this law of forbidden marriage and induced Emperor Yayäti to accept Devayäné. Devayäné had a girl friend named Çarmiñöhä, who also fell in love with the emperor and thus went with her friend Devayäné. Çukräcärya forbade Emperor Yayäti to call Çarmiñöhä into his bedroom, but Yayäti could not strictly follow his instruction. He secretly married Çarmiñöhä also and begot sons by her. When this was known by Devayäné, she went to her father and lodged a complaint. Yayäti was much attached to Devayäné, and when he went to his father-in-law's place to call her, Çukräcärya was angry with him and cursed him to become impotent. Yayäti begged his father-in-law to withdraw his curse, but the sage asked Yayäti to ask youthfulness from his sons and let them become old as the condition of his becoming potent. He had five sons, two from Devayäné and three from Çarmiñöhä. From his five sons, namely (1) Yadu, (2) Turvasu, (3) Druhyu, (4) Anu and (5) Püru, five famous dynasties, namely (1) the Yadu dynasty, (2) the Yavana (Turk) dynasty, (3) the Bhoja dynasty, (4) the Mleccha dynasty (Greek) and (5) the Paurava dynasty, all emanated to spread all over the world. He reached the heavenly planets by dint of his pious acts, but he fell down from there because of his self-advertisement and criticizing other great souls. After his fall, his daughter and grandson bestowed upon him their accumulated virtues, and by the help of his grandson and friend Çibi, he was again promoted to the heavenly kingdom, becoming one of the assembly members of Yamaräja, with whom he is staying as a devotee. He performed more than one thousand different sacrifices, gave in charity very liberally and was a very influential king. His majestic power was felt all over the world. His youngest son agreed to award him his youthfulness when he was troubled with lustful desires, even for one thousand years. Finally he became detached from worldly life and returned the youthfulness again to his son Püru. He wanted to hand over the kingdom to Püru, but his noblemen and the subjects did not agree. But when he explained to his subjects the greatness of Püru, they agreed to accept Püru as the King, and thus Emperor Yayäti retired from family life and left home for the forest."
