By the grace of the Lord, the recovery was executed, and the unscrupulous kings who joined with Duryodhana were killed by Him. Others also died, their duration of life having decreased for their rough handling of the hair of Queen Draupadé.",

The killing of the above-mentioned innocent creatures is totally forbidden because even by insulting them one loses one's duration of life. In the age of Kali they are not properly protected, and therefore the duration of life of the present generation has shortened considerably. In the Bhagavad-gétä it is stated that when the women become unchaste for want of proper protection, there are unwanted children called varëa-saìkara. To insult a chaste woman means to bring about disaster in the duration of life. Duùçäsana, a brother of Duryodhana, insulted Draupadé, an ideal chaste lady, and therefore the miscreants died untimely. These are some of the stringent laws of the Lord mentioned above."
