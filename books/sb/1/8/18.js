            "content": "Çrématé Kuntédevé was quite aware that Kåñëa is the original Personality of Godhead, although He was playing the part of her nephew. Such an enlightened lady could not commit a mistake by offering obeisances unto her nephew. Therefore, she addressed Him as the original puruña beyond the material cosmos. Although all living entities are also transcendental, they are neither original nor infallible. The living entities are apt to fall down under the clutches of material nature, but the Lord is never like that. In the Vedas, therefore, He is described as the chief among all living entities (nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13)). Then again He is addressed as éçvara, or the controller. The living entities or the demigods like Candra and Sürya are also to some extent éçvara, but none of them is the supreme éçvara, or the ultimate controller. He is the parameçvara, or the Supersoul. He is both within and without. Although He was present before Çrématé Kunté as her nephew, He was also within her and everyone else. In the Bhagavad-gétä  the Lord says, \"I am situated in everyone's heart, and only due to Me one remembers, forgets and is cognizant, etc. Through all the Vedas I am to be known because I am the compiler of the Vedas and I am the teacher of the Vedänta.\" Queen Kunté affirms that the Lord, although both within and without all living beings, is still invisible. The Lord is, so to speak, a puzzle for the common man. Queen Kunté experienced personally that Lord Kåñëa was present before her yet He entered within the womb of Uttarä to save her embryo from the attack of Açvatthämä's brahmästra. Kunté herself was puzzled about whether Çré Kåñëa is all-pervasive or localized. In fact, He is both, but He reserves the right of not being exposed to persons who are not surrendered souls. This checking curtain is called the mäyä energy of the Supreme Lord, and it controls the limited vision of the rebellious soul. It is explained as follows."
