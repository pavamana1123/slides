The Päëòavas are undoubtedly well established in name and fame and are guided by the great King Yudhiñöhira, who is morality personified, and the Yadus are undoubtedly great allies, but without the guidance of Lord Kåñëa all of them are nonentities, as much as the senses of the body are useless without the guidance of consciousness. No one should be proud of his prestige, power and fame without being guided by the favor of the Supreme Lord. The living beings are always dependent, and the ultimate dependable object is the Lord Himself. We may, therefore, invent by our advancement of material knowledge all sorts of counteracting material resources, but without being guided by the Lord all such inventions end in fiasco, however strong and stout the reactionary elements may be."
