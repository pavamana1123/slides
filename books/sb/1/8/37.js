            "content": "The Päëòavas are most fortunate because with all good luck they were entirely dependent on the mercy of the Lord. In the material world, to be dependent on the mercy of someone else is the utmost sign of misfortune, but in the case of our transcendental relation with the Lord, it is the most fortunate case when we can live completely dependent on Him. The material disease is due to thinking of becoming independent of everything. But the cruel material nature does not allow us to become independent. The false attempt to become independent of the stringent laws of nature is known as material advancement of experimental knowledge. The whole material world is moving on this false attempt of becoming independent of the laws of nature. Beginning from Rävaëa, who wanted to prepare a direct staircase to the planets of heaven, down to the present age, they are trying to overcome the laws of nature. They are trying now to approach distant planetary systems by electronic mechanical power. But the highest goal of human civilization is to work hard under the guidance of the Lord and become completely dependent on Him. The highest achievement of perfect civilization is to work with valor but at the same time depend completely on the Lord. The Päëòavas were the ideal executors of this standard of civilization. Undoubtedly they were completely dependent on the good will of Lord Çré Kåñëa, but they were not idle parasites of the Lord. They were all highly qualified both by personal character and by physical activities. Still they always looked for the mercy of the Lord because they knew that every living being is dependent by constitutional position. The perfection of life is, therefore, to become dependent on the will of the Lord, instead of becoming falsely independent in the material world. Those who try to become falsely independent of the Lord are called anätha, or without any guardian, whereas those who are completely dependent on the will of the Lord are called sanätha, or those having someone to protect them. Therefore we must try to be sanätha so that we can always be protected from the unfavorable condition of material existence. By the deluding power of the external material nature we forget that the material condition of life is the most undesirable perplexity. The Bhagavad-gétä therefore directs us (7.19) that after many, many births one fortunate person becomes aware of the fact that Väsudeva is all in all and that the best way of leading one's life is to surrender unto Him completely. That is the sign of a mahätmä. All the members of the Päëòava family were mahätmäs in household life. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was the head of these mahätmäs, and Queen Kuntédevé was the mother. The lessons of the Bhagavad-gétä and all the Puräëas, specifically the Bhägavata Puräëa, are therefore inevitably connected with the history of the Päëòava mahätmäs. For them, separation from the Lord was just like the separation of a fish from water. Çrématé Kuntédevé, therefore, felt such separation like a thunderbolt, and the whole prayer of the Queen is to try to persuade the Lord to stay with them. After the Battle of Kurukñetra, although the inimical kings were killed, their sons and grandsons were still there to deal with the Päëòavas. It is not only the Päëòavas who were put into the condition of enmity, but all of us are always in such a condition, and the best way of living is to become completely dependent on the will of the Lord and thereby overcome all difficulties of material existence."
