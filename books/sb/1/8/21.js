Queen Kunté specifically adores the incarnation or descent of Lord Kåñëa above all other incarnations because in this particular incarnation He is more approachable. In the Räma incarnation He remained a king's son from His very childhood, but in the incarnation of Kåñëa, although He was the son of a king, He at once left the shelter of His real father and mother (King Vasudeva and Queen Devaké) just after His appearance and went to the lap of Yaçodämäyé to play the part of an ordinary cowherd boy in the blessed Vrajabhümi, which is very sanctified because of His childhood pastimes. Therefore Lord Kåñëa is more merciful than Lord Räma. He was undoubtedly very kind to Kunté's brother Vasudeva and the family. Had He not become the son of Vasudeva and Devaké, Queen Kunté could not claim Him to be her nephew and thus address Kåñëa in parental affection. But Nanda and Yaçodä are more fortunate because they could relish the Lord's childhood pastimes, which are more attractive than all other pastimes. There is no parallel to His childhood pastimes as exhibited at Vrajabhümi, which are the prototypes of His eternal affairs in the original Kåñëaloka described as the cintämaëi-dhäma in the Brahma-saàhitä. Lord Çré Kåñëa descended Himself at Vrajabhümi with all His transcendental entourage and paraphernalia. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu therefore confirmed that no one is as fortunate as the residents of Vrajabhümi, and specifically the cowherd girls, who dedicated their everything for the satisfaction of the Lord. His pastimes with Nanda and Yaçodä and His pastimes with the cowherd men and especially with the cowherd boys and the cows have caused Him to be known as Govinda. Lord Kåñëa as Govinda is more inclined to the brähmaëas and the cows, indicating thereby that human prosperity depends more on these two items, namely brahminical culture and cow protection. Lord Kåñëa is never satisfied where these are lacking."
