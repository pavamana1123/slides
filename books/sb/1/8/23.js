            "content": "Devaké, the mother of Kåñëa and sister of King Kaàsa, was put into prison along with her husband, Vasudeva, because the envious King was afraid of being killed by Devaké's eighth son (Kåñëa). He killed all the sons of Devaké who were born before Kåñëa, but Kåñëa escaped the danger of child-slaughter because He was transferred to the house of Nanda Mahäräja, Lord Kåñëa's foster father. Kuntédevé, along with her children, was also saved from a series of dangers. But Kuntédevé was shown far more favor because Lord Kåñëa did not save the other children of Devaké whereas He saved the children of Kuntédevé. This was done because Devaké's husband, Vasudeva, was living whereas Kuntédevé was a widow and there was none to help her except Kåñëa. The conclusion is that Kåñëa endows more favor to a devotee who is in greater dangers. Sometimes He puts His pure devotees in such dangers because in that condition of helplessness the devotee becomes more attached to the Lord. The more the attachment is there for the Lord, the more success is there for the devotee."
