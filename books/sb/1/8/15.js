In other words, the glowing effulgence known as brahma-tejas is nothing but the rays of the Lord, just as the sun rays are rays of the sun disc. So this Brahma weapon also, although materially irresistible, could not surpass the supreme strength of the Lord. The weapon called brahmästra, released by Açvatthämä, was neutralized and foiled by Lord Çré Kåñëa by His own energy; that is to say, He did not wait for any other's help because He is absolute."
