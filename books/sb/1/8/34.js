            "content": "Brahmä, or the first living being born just after the creation, is the direct son of Näräyaëa. Näräyaëa, as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, first of all entered the material universe. Without spiritual contact, matter cannot create. This principle was followed from the very beginning of the creation. The Supreme Spirit entered the universe, and the first living being, Brahmä, was born on a lotus flower grown out of the transcendental abdomen of Viñëu. Viñëu is therefore known as Padmanäbha. Brahmä is known as ätma-bhü because he was begotten directly from the father without any contact of mother Lakñméjé. Lakñméjé was present near Näräyaëa, engaged in the service of the Lord, and still, without contact with Lakñméjé, Näräyaëa begot Brahmä. That is the omnipotency of the Lord. One who foolishly considers Näräyaëa like other living beings should take a lesson from this. Näräyaëa is not an ordinary living being. He is the Personality of Godhead Himself, and He has all the potencies of all the senses in all parts of His transcendental body. An ordinary living being begets a child by sexual intercourse, and he has no other means to beget a child other than the one designed for him. But Näräyaëa, being omnipotent, is not bound to any condition of energy. He is complete and independent to do anything and everything by His various potencies, very easily and perfectly. Brahmä is therefore directly the son of the father and was not put into the womb of a mother. Therefore he is known as ätma-bhü. This Brahmä is in charge of further creations in the universe, secondarily reflected by the potency of the Omnipotent. Within the halo of the universe there is a transcendental planet known as Çvetadvépa, which is the abode of the Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, the Paramätmä feature of the Supreme Lord. Whenever there is trouble in the universe that cannot be solved by the administrative demigods, they approach Brahmäjé for a solution, and if it is not to be solved even by Brahmäjé, then Brahmäjé consults and prays to the Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu for an incarnation and solution to the problems. Such a problem arose when Kaàsa and others were ruling over the earth and the earth became too much overburdened by the misdeeds of the asuras. Brahmäjé, along with other demigods, prayed at the shore of the Kñérodaka Ocean, and they were advised of the descent of Kåñëa as the son of Vasudeva and Devaké. So some people say that the Lord appeared because of the prayers of Brahmäjé."
