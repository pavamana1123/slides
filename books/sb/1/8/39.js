The marks of a flag, thunderbolt, and instrument to drive an elephant, umbrella, lotus, disc, etc., are on the bottom of the Lord's feet. These marks are impressed upon the soft dust of the land where the Lord traverses. The land of Hastinäpura was thus marked while Lord Çré Kåñëa was there with the Päëòavas, and the kingdom of the Päëòavas thus flourished by such auspicious signs. Kuntédevé pointed out these distinguished features and was afraid of ill luck in the absence of the Lord."
