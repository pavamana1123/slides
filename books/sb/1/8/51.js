Such material prosperity is sometimes hampered by sinful activities, for the materialist is sure to commit sins, even unintentionally, in the course of discharging material duties. To get relief from such sinful reactions, the Vedas prescribe several kinds of sacrifices. It is said in the Vedas that by performing the Açvamedha-yajïa (horse sacrifice) one can get relief from even brahma-hatyä (killing of a brähmaëa)."

In war either the husband or the brother or even the father or sons go to fight. And when they are killed, a fresh enmity is created, and thus a chain of actions and reactions increases which is not possible to be counteracted even by thousands of Açvamedha-yajïas."

It creates one action and another reaction simultaneously and thus increases the chain of material activities, binding the performer in material bondage. In the Bhagavad-gétä  the remedy is suggested that such actions and reactions of the path of work can be checked only when work is done on behalf of the Supreme Lord. The Battle of Kurukñetra was actually fought by the will of the Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa, as it is evident from His version, and only by His will was Yudhiñöhira placed on the throne of Hastinäpura. Therefore, factually no sin whatsoever touched the Päëòavas, who were only the order carriers of the Lord. For others, who declare war out of personal interest, the whole responsibility lies on them."
