    "translation": "Lord Çré Kåñëa caused three well-performed Açvamedha-yajïas [horse sacrifices] to be conducted by Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and thus caused his virtuous fame to be glorified in all directions, like that of Indra, who had performed one hundred such sacrifices.",

            "content": "This is something like the preface to the performances of Açvamedha-yajïa by Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. The comparison of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira to the King of heaven is significant. The King of heaven is thousands and thousands of times greater than Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira in opulence, yet the fame of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was not less. The reason is that Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was a pure devotee of the Lord, and by His grace only was King Yudhiñöhira on the level of the King of heaven, even though he performed only three yajïas whereas the King of heaven performed hundreds. That is the prerogative of the devotee of the Lord. The Lord is equal to everyone, but a devotee of the Lord is more glorified because he is always in touch with the all-great. The sun rays are equally distributed, but still there are some places which are always dark. This is not due to the sun but to the receptive power. Similarly, those who are cent percent devotees of the Lord get the full-fledged mercy of the Lord, which is always equally distributed everywhere."
