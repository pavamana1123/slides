            "content": "Açvamedha-yajïas or Gomedha-yajïas, sacrifices in which a horse or a bull is sacrificed, were not, of course, for the purpose of killing the animals. Lord Caitanya said that such animals sacrificed on the altar of yajïa were rejuvenated and a new life was given to them. It was just to prove the efficacy of the hymns of the Vedas. By recitation of the hymns of the Vedas in the proper way, certainly the performer gets relief from the reactions of sins, but in case of such sacrifices improperly done under inexpert management, surely one has to become responsible for animal sacrifice. In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy there is no possibility of performing the yajïas perfectly for want of expert brähmaëas who are able to conduct such yajïas. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira therefore gives a hint to performing sacrifices in the age of Kali. In the Kali-yuga the only sacrifice recommended is the performance of hari-näma-yajïa inaugurated by Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. But one should not indulge in animal killing and counteract it by performing the hari-näma yajïa. Those who are devotees of the Lord never kill an animal for self-interest, and (as the Lord ordered Arjuna) they do not refrain from performing the duty of a kñatriya. The whole purpose, therefore, is served when everything is done for the will of the Lord. This is possible only for the devotees."
