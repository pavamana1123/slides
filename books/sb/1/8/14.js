Therefore, from within the body of Uttarä He covered the embryo to save Mahäräja Parékñit and protect the progeny of Mahäräja Kuru, of whom King Päëòu was also a descendant. Both the sons of Dhåtaräñöra and those of Päëòu belonged to the same dynasty of Mahäräja Kuru; therefore both of them were generally known as Kurus. But when there were differences between the two families, the sons of Dhåtaräñöra were known as Kurus whereas the sons of Päëòu were known as Päëòavas. Since the sons and grandsons of Dhåtaräñöra were all killed in the Battle of Kurukñetra, the last son of the dynasty is designated as the son of the Kurus."
