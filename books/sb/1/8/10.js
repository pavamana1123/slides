Abhimanyu's widow, Uttarä, should have followed the path of her husband, but because she was pregnant, and Mahäräja Parékñit, a great devotee of the Lord, was lying in embryo, she was responsible for his protection. The mother of a child has a great responsibility in giving all protection to the child, and therefore Uttarä was not ashamed to express this frankly before Lord Kåñëa. Uttarä was the daughter of a great king, the wife of a great hero, and student of a great devotee, and later she was the mother of a good king also. She was fortunate in every respect."
