Duryodhana was there on the throne, and he was doing well in his administration, and in one sense there was no need of fighting. But on the principle of justice Yudhiñöhira was to replace him. The whole clique of politics centered around this point, and all the kings and residents of the whole world became involved in this fight between the rival brothers. Lord Kåñëa was also there on the side of King Yudhiñöhira. It is said in the Mahäbhärata, Adi-parva (20) that 640,000,000 men were killed in the eighteen days of the Battle of Kurukñetra, and some hundreds of thousands were missing. Practically this was the greatest battle in the world within five thousand years."

            "content": "This mass killing simply to enthrone Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was too mortifying, so he tried to be convinced with evidences from histories by great sages like Vyäsa and the Lord Himself that the fight was just because the cause was just. But Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira would not be satisfied, even though he was instructed by the greatest personalities of the time. Kåñëa is designated herein as the performer of superhuman actions, but in this particular instance neither He nor Vyäsa could convince King Yudhiñöhira. Does it mean that He failed to be a superhuman actor? No, certainly not. The interpretation is that the Lord as éçvara, or the Supersoul in the hearts of both King Yudhiñöhira and Vyäsa, performed still more superhuman action because the Lord desired it. As Supersoul of King Yudhiñöhira, He did not allow the King to be convinced by the words of Vyäsa and others, including Himself, because He desired that the King hear instructions from the dying Bhéñmadeva, who was another great devotee of the Lord. The Lord wanted that at the last stage of his material existence the great warrior Bhéñmadeva see Him personally and see his beloved grandchildren, King Yudhiñöhira, etc., now situated on the throne, and thus pass away very peacefully. Bhéñmadeva was not at all satisfied to fight against the Päëòavas, who were his beloved fatherless grandchildren. But the kñatriyas are also very stern people, and therefore he was obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because he was maintained at the expense of Duryodhana. Besides this, the Lord also desired that King Yudhiñöhira be pacified by the words of Bhéñmadeva so that the world could see that Bhéñmadeva excelled all in knowledge, including the Lord Himself."
