They are all innocent creatures, and in all circumstances killing of them is forbidden in the scriptures. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was aware of these mass killings. Similarly, there were friends, parents and preceptors also on both sides, and all of them were killed. It was simply horrible for him to think of such killing, and therefore he was thinking of residing in hell for millions and billions of years."
