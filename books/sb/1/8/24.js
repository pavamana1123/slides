But Kuntédevé and her sons were put into one difficulty after another for years and years together. They were put into trouble by Duryodhana and his party due to the kingdom, and each and every time the sons of Kunté were saved by the Lord. Once Bhéma was administered poison in a cake, once they were put into the house made of shellac and set afire, and once Draupadé was dragged out, and attempts were made to insult her by stripping her naked in the vicious assembly of the Kurus. The Lord saved Draupadé by supplying an immeasurable length of cloth, and Duryodhana's party failed to see her naked. Similarly, when they were exiled in the forest, Bhéma had to fight with the man-eater demon Hiòimbä Räkñasa, but the Lord saved him. So it was not finished there. After all these tribulations, there was the great Battle of Kurukñetra, and Arjuna had to meet such great generals as Droëa, Bhéñma and Karëa, all powerful fighters. And at last, even when everything was done away with, there was the brahmästra released by the son of Droëäcärya to kill the child within the womb of Uttarä, and so the Lord saved the only surviving descendant of the Kurus, Mahäräja Parékñit."
