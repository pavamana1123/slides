The Päëòava family was a family of devotees, and therefore the Lord wanted them to rule the world. That was the reason He vanquished the rule of the company of Duryodhana and established the rule of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. Therefore, He also wanted to protect Mahäräja Parékñit, who was lying in embryo. He did not like the idea that the world should be without the Päëòavas, the ideal family of devotees."
