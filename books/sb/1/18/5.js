But he could not do so satisfactorily due to the presence of Mahäräja Parékñit. That is the way of good government. The disturbing elements like the personality of Kali will always try to extend their nefarious activities, but it is the duty of the able state to check them by all means. Although Mahäräja Parékñit allotted places for the personality of Kali, at the same time he gave no chance for the citizens to be swayed by the personality of Kali."
