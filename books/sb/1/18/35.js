Mahäräja Parékñit gave license to Kali to live in four places as mentioned hereinbefore, but by his very expert government the personality of Kali could hardly find the places allotted him. The personality of Kali-yuga, therefore, was seeking the opportunity to establish authority, and by the grace of the Lord he found a hole in the puffed-up, inexperienced son of a brähmaëa. The little brähmaëa wanted to show his prowess in destruction, and he had the audacity to punish such a great king as Mahäräja Parékñit. He wanted to take the place of Lord Kåñëa after His departure. These are the principal signs of upstarts who want to take the place of Çré Kåñëa under the influence of the age of Kali. An upstart with a little power wants to become an incarnation of the Lord. There are many false incarnations after the departure of Lord Kåñëa from the face of the globe, and they are misleading the innocent public by accepting the spiritual obedience of the general mass of people to maintain false prestige. In other words, the personality of Kali got the opportunity to reign through this son of a brähmaëa, Çåìgi."
