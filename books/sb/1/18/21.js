    "translation": "Who can be worthy of the name of the Supreme Lord but the Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa? Brahmäjé collected the water emanating from the nails of His feet in order to award it to Lord Çiva as a worshipful welcome. This very water [the Ganges] is purifying the whole universe, including Lord Çiva.",

            "content": "The conception of many gods in the Vedic literatures by the ignorant is completely wrong. The Lord is one without a second, but He expands Himself in many ways, and this is confirmed in the Vedas. Such expansions of the Lord are limitless, but some of them are the living entities. The living entities are not as powerful as the Lord's plenary expansions, and therefore there are two different types of expansions. Lord Brahmä is generally one of the living entities, and Lord Çiva is the via medium between the Lord and the living entities. In other words, even demigods like Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, who are the chief amongst all demigods, are never equal to or greater than Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, and all-powerful demigods like Brahmä and Çiva are engaged in the worship of Viñëu or Lord Kåñëa; therefore who can be more powerful than Mukunda (Lord Kåñëa) to be factually called the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The goddess of fortune, Lakñméjé, Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva are not independently powerful; they are powerful as expansions of the Supreme Lord, and all of them are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, and so also are the living entities. There are four sects of worshipful devotees of the Lord, and the chief amongst them are the Brahma-sampradäya, Rudra-sampradäya and Çré-sampradäya, descending directly from Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and the goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, respectively. Besides the above-mentioned three sampradäyas, there is the Kumära-sampradäya, descending from Sanat-kumära. All of the four original sampradäyas are still scrupulously engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord up to date, and they all declare that Lord Kåñëa, Mukunda, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no other personality is equal to Him or greater than Him."
