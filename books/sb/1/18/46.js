    "translation": "The Emperor Parékñit is a pious king. He is highly celebrated and is a first-class devotee of the Personality of Godhead. He is a saint amongst royalty, and he has performed many horse sacrifices. When such a king is tired and fatigued, being stricken with hunger and thirst, he does not at all deserve to be cursed.",

            "content": "After explaining the general codes relating to the royal position and asserting that the king can do no wrong and therefore is never to be condemned, the sage Çaméka wanted to say something about Emperor Parékñit specifically. The specific qualification of Mahäräja Parékñit is summarized herein. The King, even calculated as a king only, was most celebrated as a ruler who administered the religious principles of the royal order. In the çästras the duties of all castes and orders of society are prescribed. All the qualities of a kñatriya mentioned in the Bhagavad-gétä  were present in the person of the Emperor. He was also a great devotee of the Lord and a self-realized soul. Cursing such a king, when he was tired and fatigued with hunger and thirst, was not at all proper. Çaméka Åñi thus admitted from all sides that Mahäräja Parékñit was cursed most unjustly. Although all the brähmaëas were aloof from the incident, still for the childish action of a brähmaëa boy the whole world situation was changed. Thus Åñi Çaméka, a brähmaëa, took responsibility for all deterioration of the good orders of the world."
