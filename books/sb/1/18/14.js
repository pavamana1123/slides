    "translation": "The Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa [Govinda], is the exclusive shelter for all great living beings, and His transcendental attributes cannot even be measured by such masters of mystic powers as Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä. Can anyone who is expert in relishing nectar [rasa] ever be fully satiated by hearing topics about Him?",

            "content": "Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä are two chiefs of the demigods. They are full of mystic powers. For example, Lord Çiva drank an ocean of poison of which one drop was sufficient to kill an ordinary living being. Similarly, Brahmä could create many powerful demigods, including Lord Çiva. So they are éçvaras, or lords of the universe. But they are not the supreme powerful. The supreme powerful is Govinda, Lord Kåñëa. He is the Transcendence, and His transcendental attributes cannot be measured even by such powerful éçvaras as Çiva and Brahmä. Therefore Lord Kåñëa is the exclusive shelter of the greatest of all living beings. Brahmä is counted amongst the living beings, but he is the greatest of all of us. And why is the greatest of all the living beings so much attached to the transcendental topics of Lord Kåñëa? Because He is the reservoir of all enjoyment. Everyone wants to relish some kind of taste in everything, but one who is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord can derive unlimited pleasure from such engagement. The Lord is unlimited, and His name, attributes, pastimes, entourage, variegatedness, etc. are unlimited, and those who relish them can do so unlimitedly and still not feel satiated. This fact is confirmed in the Padma Puräëa:"

Süta Gosvämé desired to continue the topics of Lord Kåñëa before the sages of Naimiñäraëya, and the sages also expressed their readiness to hear from him continuously. Since the Lord is transcendence and His attributes are transcendental, such discourses increase the receptive mood of the purified audience."
