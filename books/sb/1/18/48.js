The Lord can only give direction to take shelter of the devotee. He thought within himself that if Mahäräja Parékñit would countercurse the boy, he might be saved. But he knew also that a pure devotee is callous about worldly advantages or reverses. As such, the devotees are never inclined to counteract personal defamation, curses, negligence, etc. As far as such things are concerned, in personal affairs the devotees do not care for them. But in the case of their being performed against the Lord and His devotees, then the devotees take very strong action. It was a personal affair, and therefore Çaméka Åñi knew that the King would not take counteraction. Thus there was no alternative than to place an appeal to the Lord for the immature boy."

But a powerful devotee never misuses the power for personal benefit. Whatever power the devotee may have is always utilized in service towards the Lord and His devotees only."
