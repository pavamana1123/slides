Mahäräja Parékñit's garlanding the sage with a dead snake was not at all a very serious offense, but Çåìgi's cursing the King was a serious offense. The serious offense was committed by a foolish child only; therefore he deserved to be pardoned by the Supreme Lord, although it was not possible to get free from the sinful reaction. Mahäräja Parékñit also did not mind the curse offered to him by a foolish brähmaëa. On the contrary, he took full advantage of the awkward situation, and by the great will of the Lord, Mahäräja Parékñit achieved the highest perfection of life through the grace of Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé. Actually it was the desire of the Lord, and Mahäräja Parékñit, Åñi Çaméka and his son Çåìgi were all instrumental in fulfilling the desire of the Lord. So none of them were put into difficulty because everything was done in relation with the Supreme Person."
