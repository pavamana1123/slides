            "content": "A self-surrendered devotee of the Lord is called näräyaëa-paräyaëa. Such a person is never afraid of any place or person, not even of death. For him nothing is as important as the Supreme Lord, and thus he gives equal importance to heaven and hell. He knows well that both heaven and hell are creations of the Lord, and similarly life and death are different conditions of existence created by the Lord. But in all conditions and in all circumstances, remembrance of Näräyaëa is essential. The näräyaëa-paräyaëa practices this constantly. Mahäräja Parékñit was such a pure devotee. He was wrongfully cursed by an inexperienced son of a brähmaëa, who was under the influence of Kali, and Mahäräja Parékñit took this to be sent by Näräyaëa. He knew that Näräyaëa (Lord Kåñëa) had saved him when he was burned in the womb of his mother, and if he were to be killed by a snake bite, it would also take place by the will of the Lord. The devotee never goes against the will of the Lord; anything sent by God is a blessing for the devotee. Therefore Mahäräja Parékñit was neither afraid of nor bewildered by such things. That is the sign of a pure devotee of the Lord."
