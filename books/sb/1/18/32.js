This boy was known as Çåìgi, and he achieved good training in brahmacarya by his father so that he could be as powerful as a brähmaëa, even at that age. But because the age of Kali was seeking an opportunity to spoil the cultural heritage of the four orders of life, the inexperienced boy gave a chance for the age of Kali to enter into the field of Vedic culture. Hatred of the lower orders of life began from this brähmaëa boy, under the influence of Kali, and thus cultural life began to dwindle day after day. The first victim of brahminical injustice was Mahäräja Parékñit, and thus the protection given by the King against the onslaught of Kali was slackened."
