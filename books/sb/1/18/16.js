            "content": "There is some controversy amongst the students on the path of liberation. Such transcendental students are known as impersonalists and devotees of the Lord. The devotee of the Lord worships the transcendental form of the Lord, whereas the impersonalist meditates upon the glaring effulgence, or the bodily rays of the Lord, known as the brahmajyoti. Here in this verse it is said that Mahäräja Parékñit attained the lotus feet of the Lord by instructions in knowledge delivered by the son of Vyäsadeva, Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé. Çukadeva Gosvämé was also an impersonalist in the beginning, as he himself has admitted in the Bhägavatam , but later on he was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord and thus became a devotee. Such devotees with perfect knowledge are called mahä-bhägavatas, or first-class devotees. There are three classes of devotees, namely the präkåta, madhyama, and mahä-bhägavata. The präkåta, or third-class devotees, are temple worshipers without specific knowledge of the Lord and the Lord's devotees. The madhyama, or the second-class devotee, knows well the Lord, the Lord's devotees, the neophytes, and the nondevotees also. But the mahä-bhägavata, or the first-class devotee, sees everything in relation with the Lord and the Lord present in everyone's relation. The mahä-bhägavata, therefore, does not make any distinction, particularly between a devotee and nondevotee. Mahäräja Parékñit was such a mahä-bhägavata devotee because he was initiated by a mahä-bhägavata devotee, Çukadeva Gosvämé. He was equally kind, even to the personality of Kali, and what to speak of others."

            "content": "So there are many instances in the transcendental histories of the world of an impersonalist who has later become a devotee. But a devotee has never become an impersonalist. This very fact proves that on the transcendental steps, the step occupied by a devotee is higher than the step occupied by an impersonalist. It is also stated in the Bhagavad-gétä , and perfect knowledge, as delivered by Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé, results in the attainment of the transcendental service of the Lord."
