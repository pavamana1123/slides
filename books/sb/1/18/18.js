    "translation": "Çré Süta Gosvämé said: O God, although we are born in a mixed caste, we are still promoted in birthright simply by serving and following the great who are advanced in knowledge. Even by conversing with such great souls, one can without delay cleanse oneself of all disqualifications resulting from lower births.",

            "content": "Süta Gosvämé did not take his birth in a brähmaëa family. He was born in a family of mixed caste, or an uncultured low family. But because of higher association, like Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé and the great åñis of Naimiñäraëya, certainly the disqualification of inferior birth was washed off. Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu followed this principle in pursuance of the Vedic usages, and by His transcendental association He elevated many lowborn, or those disqualified by birth or action, to the status of devotional service and established them in the position of äcäryas, or authorities. He clearly stated that any man, whatever he may be, whether a brähmaëa or çüdra by birth, or a householder or mendicant in the order of society, if he is conversant with the science of Kåñëa, he can be accepted as an äcärya or guru, a spiritual master."

            "content": "Süta Gosvämé learned the science of Kåñëa from great åñis and authorities like Çukadeva and Vyäsadeva and he was so qualified that even the sages of Naimiñäraëya eagerly wanted to hear from him the science of Kåñëa in the form of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. So he had the double association of great souls by hearing and preaching. Transcendental science, or the science of Kåñëa, has to be learned from the authorities, and when one preaches the science, he becomes still more qualified. So Süta Gosvämé had both the advantages, and thus undoubtedly he was completely freed from all disqualifications of low birth and mental agonies. This verse definitely proves that Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé did not refuse to teach Süta Gosvämé about the transcendental science nor did the sages of Naimiñäraëya refuse to hear lessons from him because of his inferior birth. This means that thousands of years ago there was no bar to learning or preaching the transcendental science because of inferior birth. The rigidity of the so-called caste system in Hindu society became prominent within only one hundred years or so when the number of dvija-bandhus, or disqualified men in the families of higher castes, increased. Lord Çré Caitanya revived the original Vedic system, and He elevated Öhäkura Haridäsa to the position of nämäcärya, or the authority in preaching the glories of the holy name of the Lord, although His Holiness Çréla Haridäsa Öhäkura was pleased to appear in a family of Mohammedans."

            "content": "Such is the power of pure devotees of the Lord. The Ganges water is accepted as pure, and one can become purified after taking a bath in the waters of the Ganges. But as far as the great devotees of the Lord are concerned, they can purify a degraded soul even by being seen by the lowborn, and what to speak of association. Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu wanted to purify the whole atmosphere of the polluted world by sending qualified preachers all over the world, and it remains with the Indians to take up this task scientifically and thus do the best kind of humanitarian work. The mental diseases of the present generation are more acute than bodily diseases; it is quite fit and proper to take up the preaching of Çrémad-Bhägavatam all over the world without delay. Mahattamänäm abhidhäna also means dictionary of great devotees, or a book full of the words of great devotees. Such a dictionary of the words of great devotees and those of the Lord are in the Vedas and allied literatures, specifically the Çrémad-Bhägavatam."
