Çåìgi was showing his impudency amongst his playmates, who were innocent. Any sane man would have prevented him from doing such great harm to all human society. By killing a king like Mahäräja Parékñit, just to make a show of acquired brahminical power, the inexperienced son of a brähmaëa committed a great mistake."
