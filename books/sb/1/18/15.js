            "content": "The speaker on the transcendental activities of the Lord should have only one object of worship and service, Lord Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And the audience for such topics should be anxious to hear about Him. When such a combination is possible, namely a qualified speaker and a qualified audience, it is then and there very much congenial to continue discourses on the Transcendence. Professional speakers and a materially absorbed audience cannot derive real benefit from such discourses. Professional speakers make a show of Bhägavata-saptäha for the sake of family maintenance, and the materially disposed audience hears such discourses of Bhägavata-saptäha for some material benefit, namely religiosity, wealth, gratification of the senses, or liberation. Such Bhägavatam discourses are not purified from the contamination of the material qualities. But the discourses between the saints of Naimiñäraëya and Çré Süta Gosvämé are on the transcendental level. There is no motive for material gain. In such discourses, unlimited transcendental pleasure is relished both by the audience and by the speaker, and therefore they can continue the topics for many thousands of years. Now Bhägavata-saptähas are held for seven days only, and after finishing the show, both the audience and the speaker become engaged in material activities as usual. They can do so because the speaker is not bhagavat-pradhäna and the audience is not çuçrüñatäm, as explained above."
