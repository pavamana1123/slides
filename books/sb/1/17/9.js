            "content": "Protection of bulls and cows and all other animals can be possible only when there is a state ruled by an executive head like Mahäräja Parékñit. Mahäräja Parékñit addresses the cow as mother, for he is a cultured, twice-born, kñatriya king. Surabhi is the name of the cows which exist in the spiritual planets and are especially reared by Lord Çré Kåñëa Himself. As men are made after the form and features of the Supreme Lord, so also the cows are made after the form and features of the surabhi cows in the spiritual kingdom. In the material world the human society gives all protection to the human being, but there is no law to protect the descendants of Surabhi, who can give all protection to men by supplying the miracle food, milk. But Mahäräja Parékñit and the Päëòavas were fully conscious of the importance of the cow and bull, and they were prepared to punish the cow-killer with all chastisement, including death. There has sometimes been agitation for the protection of the cow, but for want of pious executive heads and suitable laws, the cow and the bull are not given protection. The human society should recognize the importance of the cow and the bull and thus give all protection to these important animals, following in the footsteps of Mahäräja Parékñit. For protecting the cows and brahminical culture, the Lord, who is very kind to the cow and the brähmaëas (go-brähmaëa-hitäya), will be pleased with us and will bestow upon us real peace."
