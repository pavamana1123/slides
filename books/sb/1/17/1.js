In the Bhagavad-gétä , it is said that the vaiçyas are meant to deal in agriculture, cow protection and trade. In the age of Kali, the degraded vaiçyas, the mercantile men, are engaged in supplying cows to slaughterhouses. The kñatriyas are meant to protect the citizens of the state, whereas the vaiçyas are meant to protect the cows and bulls and utilize them to produce grains and milk. The cow is meant to deliver milk, and the bull is meant to produce grains. But in the age of Kali, the çüdra class of men are in the posts of administrators, and the cows and bulls, or the mothers and the fathers, unprotected by the vaiçyas, are subjected to the slaughterhouses organized by the çüdra administrators."
