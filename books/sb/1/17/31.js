The Päëòavas were entrusted representatives of the Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, who practically brought into being the Battle of Kurukñetra, but not for any personal interest. He wanted an ideal king like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and his descendants like Mahäräja Parékñit to rule the world, and therefore a responsible king like Mahäräja Parékñit could not allow the friend of irreligiosity to flourish in his kingdom at the cost of the good fame of the Päëòavas. That is the way of wiping out corruption in the state, and not otherwise. The friends of irreligiosity should be banished from the state, and that will save the state from corruption."
