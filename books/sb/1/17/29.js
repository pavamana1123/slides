The royal dress is suitable for a king or kñatriya, but when a lower-class man artificially dresses himself as a king, his real identity is disclosed by the challenge of a bona fide kñatriya like Mahäräja Parékñit. A real kñatriya never surrenders. He accepts the challenge of his rival kñatriya, and he fights either to die or to win. Surrender is unknown to a real kñatriya. In the age of Kali there are so many pretenders dressed and posed like administrators or executive heads, but their real identity is disclosed when they are challenged by a real kñatriya. Therefore when the artificially dressed personality of Kali saw that to fight Mahäräja Parékñit was beyond his ability, he bowed down his head like a subordinate and gave up his royal dress."
