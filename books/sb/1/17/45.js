Both of them are the pillars of all happiness, and therefore they are meant for full cooperation for common welfare. Mahäräja Parékñit was experienced enough to drive away Kali from his field of activities and thereby make the state receptive to spiritual enlightenment. If the common people are not receptive, it is very difficult to impress upon them the necessity of spiritual enlightenment. Austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, the basic principles of religion, prepare the ground for the reception of advancement in spiritual knowledge, and Mahäräja Parékñit made this favorable condition possible. Thus the åñis of Naimiñäraëya were able to perform the sacrifices for a thousand years. In other words, without state support, no doctrines of philosophy or religious principles can progressively advance. There should be complete cooperation between the brähmaëas and the kñatriyas for this common good. Even up to Mahäräja Açoka, the same spirit was prevailing. Lord Buddha was sufficiently supported by King Açoka, and thus his particular cult of knowledge was spread all over the world."
