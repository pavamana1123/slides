It is simply horrible for a pure-hearted soul to see organized animal-killing by the state in this age of Kali. Mahäräja Parékñit was lamenting for the tears in the eyes of the bull, and he was astonished to see such an unprecedented thing in his good kingdom. Men and animals were equally protected as far as life was concerned. That is the way in God's kingdom."
