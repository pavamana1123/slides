One who knows the codes of Lord Kåñëa can achieve this end without any difficulty. In the Bhagavad-gétä, in a synopsis, we can understand the codes of Godhead, and in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam the same codes are explained further."

Where such codes are not followed, the first sign is that three legs of the representative of religion are cut off, and thereby all miseries follow. When Kåñëa was personally present, the codes of Kåñëa were being followed without question, but in His absence such codes are presented in the pages of Çrémad-Bhägavatam for the guidance of the blind persons who happen to be at the helm of all affairs."
