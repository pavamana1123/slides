            "content": "The present city of Delhi was formerly known as Hastinäpura because it was first established by King Hasté. Gosvämé Çukadeva, after leaving his paternal home, was roaming like a madman, and therefore it was very difficult for the citizens to recognize him in his exalted position. A sage is not, therefore, recognized by sight, but by hearing. One should approach a sädhu or great sage not to see but to hear him. If one is not prepared to hear the words of a sädhu, there is no profit. Çukadeva Gosvämé was a sädhu who could speak on the transcendental activities of the Lord. He did not satisfy the whims of ordinary citizens. He was recognized when he spoke on the subject of Bhägavatam, and he never attempted jugglery like a magician. Outwardly he appeared to be a retarded, dumb madman, but in fact he was the most elevated transcendental personality."
