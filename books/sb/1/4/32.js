The monist is not counted amongst the paramahaàsas (the most perfect of the renounced order of life). Çrémad-Bhägavatam is full of narrations of the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead. Although Vyäsadeva was an empowered divinity, he still felt dissatisfaction because in none of his works were the transcendental activities of the Lord properly explained. The inspiration was infused by Çré Kåñëa directly in the heart of Vyäsadeva, and thus he felt the vacuum as explained above. It is definitely expressed herewith that without the transcendental loving service of the Lord, everything is void; but in the transcendental service of the Lord, everything is tangible without any separate attempt at fruitive work or empiric philosophical speculation."
