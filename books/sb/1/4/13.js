The brähmaëas are meant to administer some fruitive sacrifices mentioned in the Vedas, but the parivräjakäcäryas, or learned preachers, are meant to disseminate transcendental knowledge to one and all. As such, the parivräjakäcäryas are not always expert in pronouncing the Vedic mantras, which are practiced systematically by accent and meter by the brähmaëas who are meant for administering Vedic rites. Yet it should not be considered that the brähmaëas are more important than the itinerant preachers. They are one and different simultaneously because they are meant for the same end, in different ways."

            "content": "There is no difference also between the Vedic mantras and what is explained in the Puräëas and Itihäsa. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, it is mentioned in the Mädhyandina-çruti that all the Vedas, namely the Säma, Atharva, Åg, Yajur, Puräëas, Itihäsas, Upaniñads, etc., are emanations from the breathing of the Supreme Being. The only difference is that the Vedic mantras are mostly begun with praëava oàkära, and it requires some training to practice the metric pronunciation of the Vedic mantras. But that does not mean that Çrémad-Bhägavatam is of less importance than the Vedic mantras. On the contrary, it is the ripened fruit of all the Vedas, as stated before. Besides that, the most perfectly liberated soul, Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé, is absorbed in the studies of the Bhägavatam, although he is already self-realized. Çréla Süta Gosvämé is following his footsteps, and therefore his position is not the least less important because he was not expert in chanting Vedic mantras with metric pronunciation, which depends more on practice than actual realization. Realization is more important than parrotlike chanting."
