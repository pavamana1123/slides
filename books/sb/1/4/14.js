During the regime of Vaivasvata Manu, there was an overlapping of the twenty-eighth round of the four millenniums, and the third millennium appeared prior to the second. In that particular millennium, Lord Çré Kåñëa also descends, and because of this there was some particular alteration. The mother of the great sage was Satyavaté the daughter of the Vasu (fisherman), and the father was the great Paräçara Muni. That is the history of Vyäsadeva's birth. Every millennium is divided into three periods, and each period is called a sandhyä. Vyäsadeva appeared in the third sandhyä of that particular age."
