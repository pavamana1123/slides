They were not interested in hearing it from a bogus person who would interpret in his own way to suit his own purpose. Generally the so-called Bhägavatam reciters are either professional readers or so-called learned impersonalists who cannot enter into the transcendental personal activities of the Supreme Person. Such impersonalists twist some meanings out of Bhägavatam to suit and support impersonalist views, and the professional readers at once go to the Tenth Canto to misexplain the most confidential part of the Lord's pastimes. Neither of these reciters are bona fide persons to recite Bhägavatam. Only one who is prepared to present Bhägavatam in the light of Çukadeva Gosvämé and only those who are prepared to hear Çukadeva Gosvämé and his representative are bona fide participants in the transcendental discussion of Çrémad-Bhägavatam."
