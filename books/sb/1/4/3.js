It was known to them that Çréla Vyäsadeva had already explained the text of the Vedas in various ways up to the Mahäbhärata for the understanding of less intelligent women, çüdras and fallen members of the family of twice-born men. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is transcendental to all of them because it has nothing to do with anything mundane. So the inquiries are very intelligent and relevant."
