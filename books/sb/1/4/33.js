So Närada is the second äcärya in the line of spiritual disciplic succession. He is the representative of Brahmä, and therefore he is respected exactly like Brahmä, the father of all vidhis (regulations); similarly all other successive disciples in the chain are also equally respected as representatives of the original spiritual master."
