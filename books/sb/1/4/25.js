Such descendants are not recognized as such, for want of purificatory achievements. The purificatory activities begin even before the birth of a child, and the seed-giving reformatory process is called Garbhädhäna-saàskära. One who has not undergone such Garbhädhäna-saàskära, or spiritual family planning, is not accepted as being of an actual twice-born family. The Garbhädhäna-saàskära is followed by other purificatory processes, out of which the sacred thread ceremony is one. This is performed at the time of spiritual initiation. After this particular saàskära, one is rightly called twice-born. One birth is calculated during the seed-giving saàskära, and the second birth is calculated at the time of spiritual initiation. One who has been able to undergo such important saàskäras can be called a bona fide twice-born."

These dvija-bandhus are certainly not as intelligent as the children of the regular twice-born families. The dvija-bandhus are classified with the çüdras and the woman class, who are by nature less intelligent. The çüdras and the woman class do not have to undergo any saàskära save and except the ceremony of marriage."

            "content": "The less intelligent classes of men, namely women, çüdras and unqualified sons of the higher castes, are devoid of necessary qualifications to understand the purpose of the transcendental Vedas. For them the Mahäbhärata was prepared. The purpose of the Mahäbhärata is to administer the purpose of the Vedas, and therefore within this Mahäbhärata the summary Veda of Bhagavad-gétä is placed. The less intelligent are more interested in stories than in philosophy, and therefore the philosophy of the Vedas in the form of the Bhagavad-gétä is spoken by the Lord Çré Kåñëa. Vyäsadeva and Lord Kåñëa are both on the transcendental plane, and therefore they collaborated in doing good to the fallen souls of this age. The Bhagavad-gétä is the essence of all Vedic knowledge. It is the first book of spiritual values, as the Upaniñads are. The Vedänta philosophy is the subject matter for study by the spiritual graduates. Only the post-graduate spiritual student can enter into the spiritual or devotional service of the Lord. It is a great science, and the great professor is the Lord Himself in the form of Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. And persons who are empowered by Him can initiate others in the transcendental loving service of the Lord."
