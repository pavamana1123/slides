            "content": "Formerly there was only the Veda of the name Yajur, and the four divisions of sacrifices were there specifically mentioned. But to make them more easily performable, the Veda was divided into four divisions of sacrifice, just to purify the occupational service of the four orders. Above the four Vedas, namely Åg, Yajur, Säma, and Atharva, there are the Puräëas, the Mahäbhärata, Saàhitäs, etc., which are known as the fifth Veda. Çré Vyäsadeva and his many disciples were all historical personalities, and they were very kind and sympathetic toward the fallen souls of this age of Kali. As such, the Puräëas and Mahäbhärata were made from related historical facts which explained the teaching of the four Vedas. There is no point in doubting the authority of the Puräëas and Mahäbhärata as parts and parcels of the Vedas. In the Chändogya Upaniñad (7.1.4), the Puräëas and Mahäbhärata, generally known as histories, are mentioned as the fifth Veda. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, that is the way of ascertaining the respective values of the revealed scriptures."
