The history of the birth of Dattätreya as an incarnation of the Lord is mentioned in the Brahmäëòa Puräëa in connection with the story of the devoted wife. It is said there that Anasüyä, the wife of Åñi Atri, prayed before the Lords Brahmä, Viñëu and Çiva as follows: \"My lords, if you are pleased with me, and if you desire me to ask from you some sort of blessings, then I pray that you combine together to become my son.\" This was accepted by the lords, and as Dattätreya the Lord expounded the philosophy of the spirit soul and especially instructed Alarka, Prahläda, Yadu, Haihaya, etc."
