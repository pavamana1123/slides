But Çréla Vyäsadeva divided the original Veda into four, namely Säma, Yajur, Åg, Atharva, and then again they were explained in different branches like the Puräëas and the Mahäbhärata. Vedic language and the subject matter are very difficult for ordinary men. They are understood by the highly intelligent and self-realized brähmaëas. But the present age of Kali is full of ignorant men. Even those who are born by a brähmaëa father are, in the present age, no better than the çüdras or the women. The twice-born men, namely the brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas, are expected to undergo a cultural purificatory process known as saàskäras, but because of the bad influence of the present age the so-called members of the brähmaëa and other high-order families are no longer highly cultured. They are called the dvija-bandhus, or the friends and family members of the twice-born. But these dvija-bandhus are classified amongst the çüdras and the women. Çréla Vyäsadeva divided the Vedas into various branches and subbranches for the sake of the less intelligent classes like the dvija-bandhus, çüdras and women."
