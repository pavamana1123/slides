That is not a fact. All the stories mentioned in the Puräëas and Mahäbhärata, etc., are actual histories, not only of this planet but also of millions of other planets within the universe. Sometimes the history of planets beyond this world appear to such men to be unbelievable. But they do not know that different planets are not equal in all respects and that therefore some of the historical facts derived from other planets do not correspond with the experience of this planet. Considering the different situation of different planets and also time and circumstances, there is nothing wonderful in the stories of the Puräëas, nor are they imaginary. We should always remember the maxim that one man's food is another man's poison. We should not, therefore, reject the stories and histories of the Puräëas as imaginary. The great åñis like Vyäsa had no business putting some imaginary stories in their literatures."

            "content": "In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam historical facts selected from the histories of different planets have been depicted. It is therefore accepted by all the spiritual authorities as the Mahä-Puräëa. The special significance of these histories is that they are all connected with activities of the Lord in a different time and atmosphere. Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé is the topmost personality of all the self-realized souls, and he accepted this as the subject of studies from his father, Vyäsadeva. Çréla Vyäsadeva is the great authority, and the subject matter of Çrémad-Bhägavatam being so important, he delivered the message first to his great son Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé. It is compared to the cream of the milk. Vedic literature is like the milk ocean of knowledge. Cream or butter is the most palatable essence of milk, and so also is Çrémad-Bhägavatam, for it contains all palatable, instructive and authentic versions of different activities of the Lord and His devotees. There is no gain, however, in accepting the message of Bhägavatam from the unbelievers, atheists and professional reciters who make a trade of Bhägavatam for the laymen. It was delivered to Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé, and he had nothing to do with the Bhägavata business. He did not have to maintain family expenses by such trade. Çrémad-Bhägavatam should therefore be received from the representative of Çukadeva, who must be in the renounced order of life without family encumbrance. Milk is undoubtedly very good and nourishing, but when it is touched by the mouth of a snake it is no longer nourishing; rather, it becomes a source of death. Similarly, those who are not strictly in the Vaiñëava discipline should not make a business of this Bhägavatam and become a cause of spiritual death for so many hearers. In the Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says that the purpose of all the Vedas is to know Him (Lord Kåñëa), and Çrémad-Bhägavatam is Lord Çré Kåñëa Himself in the form of recorded knowledge. Therefore, it is the cream of all the Vedas, and it contains all historical facts of all times in relation with Çré Kåñëa. It is factually the essence of all histories."
