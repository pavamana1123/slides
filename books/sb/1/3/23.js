Lord Kåñëa is not an incarnation of the puruña, as we learned from the beginning of this chapter. He is directly the original Personality of Godhead, and Balaräma is the first plenary manifestation of the Lord. From Baladeva the first phalanx of plenary expansions, Väsudeva, Saìkarñaëa, Aniruddha and Pradyumna, expands. Lord Çré Kåñëa is Väsudeva, and Baladeva is Saìkarñaëa."
