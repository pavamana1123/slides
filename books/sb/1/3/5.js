            "content": "The puruña, after creating innumerable universes in the mahat-tattva, entered in each of them as the second puruña, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu. When He saw that within the universe there was only darkness and space, without a resting place, He filled half of the universe with water from His own perspiration and laid Himself down on the same water. This water is called Garbhodaka. Then from His navel the stem of the lotus flower sprouted, and on the flower petals the birth of Brahmä, or the master engineer of the universal plan, took place. Brahmä became the engineer of the universe, and the Lord Himself took charge of the maintenance of the universe as Viñëu. Brahmä was generated from rajo-guëa of prakåti, or the mode of passion in nature, and Viñëu became the Lord of the mode of goodness. Viñëu, being transcendental to all the modes, is always aloof from materialistic affection. This has already been explained. From Brahmä there is Rudra (Çiva), who is in charge of the mode of ignorance or darkness. He destroys the whole creation by the will of the Lord. Therefore all three, namely Brahmä, Viñëu and Çiva, are incarnations of the Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu. From Brahmä the other demigods like Dakña, Maréci, Manu and many others become incarnated to generate living entities within the universe. This Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu is glorified in the Vedas in the hymns of Garbha-stuti, which begin with the description of the Lord as having thousands of heads, etc. The Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu is the Lord of the universe, and although He appears to be lying within the universe, He is always transcendental. This also has already been explained. The Viñëu who is the plenary portion of the Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu is the Supersoul of the universal life, and He is known as the maintainer of the universe or Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. So the three features of the original puruña are thus understood. And all the incarnations within the universe are emanations from this Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu."

His power is like the power of the sun reflected in valuable stones and jewels. When there is no such living being to take charge of the post of Brahmä, the Lord Himself becomes a Brahmä and takes charge of the post."

He is the plenary portion of the Lord, but because Lord Çiva is in direct touch with material nature, he is not exactly in the same transcendental position as Lord Viñëu. The difference is like that between milk and curd. Curd is nothing but milk, and yet it cannot be used in place of milk."

Within one day's duration of the life of Brahmä (which is calculated by our solar year as 4,300,000 x 1,000 years) there are fourteen Manus. Therefore there are 420 Manus in one month of Brahmä and 5,040 Manus in one year of Brahmä. Brahmä lives for one hundred years of his age, and therefore there are 5,040 x 100 or 504,000 Manus in the duration of Brahmä's life. There are innumerable universes, with one Brahmä in each of them, and all of them are created and annihilated during the breathing time of the puruña. Therefore one can simply imagine how many millions of Manus there are during one breath of the puruña."

Directly empowered incarnations are the Kumäras, Närada, Påthu, Çeña, Ananta, etc. As far as vibhütis are concerned, they are very explicitly described in the Bhagavad-gétä in the Vibhüti-yoga chapter. And for all these different types of incarnations, the fountainhead is the Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu."
