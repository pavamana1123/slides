There are selected histories of great devotees who are in direct contact with the Personality of Godhead. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the literary incarnation of Lord Çré Kåñëa and is therefore nondifferent from Him. Çrémad-Bhägavatam should be worshiped as respectfully as we worship the Lord. Thereby we can derive the ultimate blessings of the Lord through its careful and patient study. As God is all light, all bliss and all perfection, so also is Çrémad-Bhägavatam. We can have all the transcendental light of the Supreme Brahman, Çré Kåñëa, from the recitation of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, provided it is received through the medium of the transparent spiritual master. Lord Caitanya's private secretary Çréla Svarüpa Dämodara Gosvämé advised all intending visitors who came to see the Lord at Puré to make a study of the Bhägavatam from the person Bhägavatam. Person Bhägavatam is the self-realized bona fide spiritual master, and through him only can one understand the lessons of Bhägavatam in order to receive the desired result. One can derive from the study of the Bhägavatam all benefits that are possible to be derived from the personal presence of the Lord. It carries with it all the transcendental blessings of Lord Çré Kåñëa that we can expect from His personal contact."
