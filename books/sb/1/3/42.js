Unless therefore Bhägavatam or any other Vedic literatures are received through the paramparä system, the reception of knowledge is not bona fide. Vyäsadeva delivered the message to Çukadeva Gosvämé, and from Çukadeva Gosvämé, Süta Gosvämé received the message. One should therefore receive the message of Bhägavatam from Süta Gosvämé or from his representative and not from any irrelevant interpreter."

All great sages, åñis, philosophers, mystics, etc., went there due to his imperial position. They offered many suggestions about his immediate duty, and at last it was settled that he would hear from Çukadeva Gosvämé about Lord Kåñëa. Thus the Bhägavatam was spoken to him."

Indirectly Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya admitted that what he had preached in the flowery grammatical interpretations of the Vedänta-sütra cannot help one at the time of death. At the critical hour of death one must recite the name of Govinda. This is the recommendation of all great transcendentalists. Çukadeva Gosvämé had long ago stated the same truth, that at the end one must remember Näräyaëa. That is the essence of all spiritual activities. In pursuance of this eternal truth, Çrémad-Bhägavatam was heard by Emperor Parékñit, and it was recited by the able Çukadeva Gosvämé. And both the speaker and the receiver of the messages of Bhägavatam were duly delivered by the same medium."
