And yet this inundation after the period of Cäkñuña Manu took place in order to show some wonders to Satyavrata. But Çré Jéva Gosvämé has given definite proofs from authoritative scriptures (like Viñëu-dharmottara, Märkaëòeya Puräëa, Harivaàça, etc.) that there is always a devastation after the end of each and every Manu. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté has also supported Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, and he (Çré Cakravarté) has also quoted from Bhägavatämåta about this inundation after each Manu. Apart from this, the Lord, in order to show special favor to Satyavrata, a devotee of the Lord, in this particular period, incarnated Himself."
