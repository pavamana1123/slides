When there is a scarcity of such pious living beings, the Lord incarnates Himself as Brahmä, Prajäpati, Indra, etc., and takes up the charge. During the period of Sväyambhuva Manu (the present period is of Vaivasvata Manu) there was no suitable living being who could occupy the post of Indra, the King of the Indraloka (heaven) planet. The Lord Himself at that time became Indra. Assisted by His own sons like Yama and other demigods, Lord Yajïa ruled the administration of the universal affairs."
