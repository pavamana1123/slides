So there are different names of the creations in terms of the particular types of Brahmä, the father of the living beings in the creation. The Kumäras, as above mentioned, appeared in the Kaumära creation of the material world, and to teach us the process of Brahman realization, they underwent a severe type of disciplinary action as bachelors. These Kumäras are empowered incarnations. And before executing the severe type of disciplinary actions, all of them became qualified brähmaëas. This example suggests that one must first acquire the qualifications of a brähmaëa, not simply by birth but also by quality, and then one can undergo the process of Brahman realization."
