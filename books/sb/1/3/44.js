    "translation": "O learned brähmaëas, when Çukadeva Gosvämé recited Bhägavatam there [in the presence of Emperor Parékñit], I heard him with rapt attention, and thus, by his mercy, I learned the Bhägavatam from that great and powerful sage. Now I shall try to make you hear the very same thing as I learned it from him and as I have realized it.",

            "content": "One can certainly see directly the presence of Lord Çré Kåñëa in the pages of Bhägavatam if one has heard it from a self-realized great soul like Çukadeva Gosvämé. One cannot, however, learn Bhägavatam from a bogus hired reciter whose aim of life is to earn some money out of such recitation and employ the earning in sex indulgence. No one can learn Çrémad-Bhägavatam who is associated with persons engaged in sex life. That is the secret of learning Bhägavatam Nor can one learn Bhägavatam from one who interprets the text by his mundane scholarship. One has to learn Bhägavatam from the representative of Çukadeva Gosvämé, and no one else, if one at all wants to see Lord Çré Kåñëa in the pages. That is the process, and there is no alternative. Süta Gosvämé is a bona fide representative of Çukadeva Gosvämé because he wants to present the message which he received from the great learned brähmaëa. Çukadeva Gosvämé presented Bhägavatam as he heard it from his great father, and so also Süta Gosvämé is presenting Bhägavatam as he had heard it from Çukadeva Gosvämé. Simple hearing is not all; one must realize the text with proper attention. The word niviñöa means that Süta Gosvämé drank the juice of Bhägavatam through his ears. That is the real process of receiving Bhägavatam. One should hear with rapt attention from the real person, and then he can at once realize the presence of Lord Kåñëa in every page. The secret of knowing Bhägavatam is mentioned here. No one can give rapt attention who is not pure in mind. No one can be pure in mind who is not pure in action. No one can be pure in action who is not pure in eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. But somehow or other if someone hears with rapt attention from the right person, at the very beginning one can assuredly see Lord Çré Kåñëa in person in the pages of Bhägavatam."
