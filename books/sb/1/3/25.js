            "content": "Here is another foretelling of the advent of Lord Kalki, the incarnation of Godhead. He is to appear at the conjunction of the two yugas, namely at the end of Kali-yuga and the beginning of Satya-yuga. The cycle of the four yugas, namely Satya, Tretä, Dväpara and Kali, rotates like the calendar months. The present Kali-yuga lasts 432,000 years, out of which we have passed only 5,000 years after the Battle of Kurukñetra and the end of the regime of King Parékñit. So there are 427,000 years balance yet to be finished. Therefore at the end of this period, the incarnation of Kalki will take place, as foretold in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The name of His father, Viñëu Yaçä, a learned brähmaëa, and the village Çambhala are also mentioned. As above mentioned, all these foretellings will prove to be factual in chronological order. That is the authority of Çrémad-Bhägavatam."
