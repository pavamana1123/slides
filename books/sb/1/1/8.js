Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has sung in his famous eight stanzas on the spiritual master as follows: \"I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master. Only by his satisfaction can one please the Personality of Godhead, and when he is dissatisfied there is only havoc on the path of spiritual realization.\" It is essential, therefore, that a disciple be very much obedient and submissive to the bona fide spiritual master. Çréla Süta Gosvämé fulfilled all these qualifications as a disciple, and therefore he was endowed with all favors by his learned and self-realized spiritual masters such as Çréla Vyäsadeva and others. The sages of Naimiñäraëya were confident that Çréla Süta Gosvämé was bona fide. Therefore they were anxious to hear from him."
