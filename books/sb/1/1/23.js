Whenever there is gross misuse or neglect of the principles of religion, the Supreme Lord appears Himself to restore religious principles. This is stated in Bhagavad-gétä . Here the sages of Naimiñäraëya are inquiring about these principles. The reply to this question is given later. The Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the transcendental sound representation of the Personality of Godhead, and thus it is the full representation of transcendental knowledge and religious principles."
