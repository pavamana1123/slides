There is no one in creation who is not afraid of the rage of the Almighty. Great asuras like Rävaëa, Hiraëyakaçipu, Kaàsa, and others who were very powerful living entities were all killed by the Personality of Godhead. And the almighty Väsudeva has empowered His name with the powers of His personal Self. Everything is related to Him, and everything has its identity in Him. It is stated herein that the name of Kåñëa is feared even by fear personified. This indicates that the name of Kåñëa is nondifferent from Kåñëa. Therefore, the name of Kåñëa is as powerful as Lord Kåñëa Himself. There is no difference at all. Anyone, therefore, can take advantage of the holy names of Lord Çré Kåñëa even in the midst of greatest dangers. The transcendental name of Kåñëa, even though uttered unconsciously or by force of circumstances, can help one obtain freedom from the hurdle of birth and death."
