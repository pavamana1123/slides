The great sages offered the speaker of the Bhägavatam an elevated seat of respect called the vyäsäsana, or the seat of Çré Vyäsadeva. Çré Vyäsadeva is the original spiritual preceptor for all men. And all other preceptors are considered to be his representatives. A representative is one who can exactly present the viewpoint of Çré Vyäsadeva. Çré Vyäsadeva impregnated the message of Bhägavatam unto Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé, and Çré Süta Gosvämé heard it from him (Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé). All bona fide representatives of Çré Vyäsadeva in the chain of disciplic succession are to be understood to be gosvämés. These gosvämés restrain all their senses, and they stick to the path made by the previous äcäryas. The gosvämés do not deliver lectures on the Bhägavatam capriciously. Rather, they execute their services most carefully, following their predecessors who delivered the spiritual message unbroken to them."

            "content": "Those who listen to the Bhägavatam may put questions to the speaker in order to elicit the clear meaning, but this should not be done in a challenging spirit. One must submit questions with a great regard for the speaker and the subject matter. This is also the way recommended in Bhagavad-gétä. One must learn the transcendental subject by submissive aural reception from the right sources. Therefore these sages addressed the speaker Süta Gosvämé with great respect."
