            "content": "A gosvämé, or the bona fide representative of Çré Vyäsadeva, must be free from all kinds of vices. The four major vices of Kali-yuga are (1) illicit connection with women, (2) animal slaughter, (3) intoxication, (4) speculative gambling of all sorts. A gosvämé must be free from all these vices before he can dare sit on the vyäsäsana. No one should be allowed to sit on the vyäsäsana who is not spotless in character and who is not freed from the above-mentioned vices. He not only should be freed from all such vices, but must also be well versed in all revealed scriptures or in the Vedas. The Puräëas are also parts of the Vedas. And histories like the Mahäbhärata or Rämäyaëa are also parts of the Vedas. The äcärya or the gosvämé must be well acquainted with all these literatures. To hear and explain them is more important than reading them. One can assimilate the knowledge of the revealed scriptures only by hearing and explaining. Hearing is called çravaëa, and explaining is called kértana. The two processes of çravaëa and kértana are of primary importance to progressive spiritual life. Only one who has properly grasped the transcendental knowledge from the right source by submissive hearing can properly explain the subject."
