            "content": "This age of Kali is not at all suitable for self-realization as was Satya-yuga, the golden age, or Tretä- or Dväpara-yugas, the silver and copper ages. For self-realization, the people in Satya-yuga, living a lifetime of a hundred thousand years, were able to perform prolonged meditation. And in Tretä-yuga, when the duration of life was ten thousand years, self-realization was attained by performance of great sacrifice. And in the Dväpara-yuga, when the duration of life was one thousand years, self-realization was attained by worship of the Lord. But in the Kali-yuga, the maximum duration of life being one hundred years only and that combined with various difficulties, the recommended process of self-realization is that of hearing and chanting of the holy name, fame, and pastimes of the Lord. The sages of Naimiñäraëya began this process in a place meant specifically for the devotees of the Lord. They prepared themselves to hear the pastimes of the Lord over a period of one thousand years. By the example of these sages one should learn that regular hearing and recitation of the Bhägavatam is the only way for self-realization. Other attempts are simply a waste of time, for they do not give any tangible results. Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu preached this system of Bhägavata-dharma, and He recommended that all those who were born in India should take the responsibility of broadcasting the messages of Lord Çré Kåñëa, primarily the message of Bhagavad-gétä. And when one is well established in the teachings of Bhagavad-gétä, he can take up the study of Çrémad-Bhägavatam for further enlightenment in self-realization."
