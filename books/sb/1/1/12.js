Although God is equally disposed to everyone, He is especially inclined to His devotees. Sat means the Absolute Truth. And persons who are servitors of the Absolute Truth are called sätvatas. And the Personality of Godhead who protects such pure devotees is known as the protector of the sätvatas. Bhadraà te, or \"blessings upon you,\" indicates the sages' anxiety to know the Absolute Truth from the speaker. Lord Çré Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared to Devaké, the wife of Vasudeva. Vasudeva is the symbol of the transcendental position wherein the appearance of the Supreme Lord takes place."
