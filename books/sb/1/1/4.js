The hub of this great circle was fixed at a particular place known as Naimiñäraëya. Similarly, there is another reference to the forest of Naimiñäraëya in the Varäha Puräëa, where it is stated that by performance of sacrifice at this place, the strength of demoniac people is curtailed. Thus brähmaëas prefer Naimiñäraëya for such sacrificial performances."

The devotees are always attached to the service of the Lord, whereas fallen souls are attached to the pleasures of material existence. In Bhagavad-gétä, it is said that anything performed in the material world for any reason other than for the pleasure of Lord Viñëu causes further bondage for the performer. It is enjoined therefore that all acts must be performed sacrificially for the satisfaction of Viñëu and His devotees. This will bring everyone peace and prosperity."

Forgetful men do not know the right path for peace and prosperity. However, the sages know it well, and therefore for the good of all men they are always anxious to perform acts which may bring about peace in the world. They are sincere friends to all living entities, and at the risk of great personal inconvenience they are always engaged in the service of the Lord for the good of all people. Lord Viñëu is just like a great tree, and all others, including the demigods, men, Siddhas, Cäraëas, Vidyädharas and other living entities, are like branches, twigs and leaves of that tree. By pouring water on the root of the tree, all the parts of the tree are automatically nourished. Only those branches and leaves which are detached cannot be so satisfied. Detached branches and leaves dry up gradually despite all watering attempts. Similarly, human society, when it is detached from the Personality of Godhead like detached branches and leaves, is not capable of being watered, and one attempting to do so is simply wasting his energy and resources."

Çrémad-Bhägavatam is also presented for the same purpose, and this will be explained more specifically later in the text."
