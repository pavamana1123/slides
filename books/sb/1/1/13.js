            "content": "The conditions for hearing the transcendental message of the Absolute Truth are set forth herein. The first condition is that the audience must be very sincere and eager to hear. And the speaker must be in the line of disciplic succession from the recognized äcärya. The transcendental message of the Absolute is not understandable by those who are materially absorbed. Under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, one becomes gradually purified. Therefore, one must be in the chain of disciplic succession and learn the spiritual art of submissive hearing. In the case of Süta Gosvämé and the sages of Naimiñäraëya, all these conditions are fulfilled because Çréla Süta Gosvämé is in the line of Çréla Vyäsadeva, and the sages of Naimiñäraëya are all sincere souls who are anxious to learn the truth. Thus the transcendental topics of Lord Çré Kåñëa's superhuman activities, His incarnation, His birth, appearance or disappearance, His forms, His names and so on are all easily understandable because all requirements are fulfilled. Such discourses help all men on the path of spiritual realization."
