    "translation": "All the great sages who were assembled there also praised the decision of Mahäräja Parékñit and they expressed their approval by saying, \"Very good.\" Naturally the sages are inclined to do good to common men, for they have all the qualitative powers of the Supreme Lord. Therefore they were very much pleased to see Mahäräja Parékñit, a devotee of the Lord, and they spoke as follows.",

Seeing this, the great sages assembled were very pleased, and they expressed their approval by saying, \"Very good.\" Such sages are naturally inclined to do good to the common man, and when they see a personality like Mahäräja Parékñit advance in devotional service, their pleasure knows no bounds, and they offer all blessings in their power. The devotional service of the Lord is so auspicious that all demigods and sages, up to the Lord Himself, became pleased with the devotee, and therefore the devotee finds everything auspicious. All inauspicious matters are removed from the path of a progressive devotee. Meeting all the great sages at the time of death was certainly auspicious for Mahäräja Parékñit, and thus he was blessed by the so-called curse of a brähmaëa's boy."
