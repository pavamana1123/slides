Any decision, however important, should be confirmed by some authority. That makes the matter perfect. This means that the monarchs who ruled the earth in those days were not irresponsible dictators. They scrupulously followed the authoritative decisions of the saints and sages in terms of Vedic injunction. Mahäräja Parékñit, as a perfect king, followed the principles by consulting the authorities, even up to the last days of his life."
