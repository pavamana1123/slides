A spiritual master is not a kind of decoration for a householder. Generally a fashionable materialist engages a so-called spiritual master without any profit. The pseudo spiritual master flatters the so-called disciple, and thereby both the master and his ward go to hell without a doubt. Mahäräja Parékñit is the right type of disciple because he puts forward questions vital to the interest of all men, particularly for the dying men. The question put forward by Mahäräja Parékñit is the basic principle of the complete thesis of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Now let us see how intelligently the great master replies."
