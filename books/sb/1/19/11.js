Even the first-grade offender is excused simply by this process, and Mahäräja Parékñit, although honored by all the åñis and kings, welcomed all the big men in that humble etiquette in order to be excused from any offenses. Generally at the last stage of one's life this humble method is adopted by every sensible man in order to be excused before departure. In this way Mahäräja Parékñit implored everyone's good will for going back home, back to Godhead."
