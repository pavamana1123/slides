            "content": "For a devotee like Mahäräja Parékñit, none of the material planets, even the topmost Brahmaloka, is as desirable as Goloka Våndävana, the abode of Lord Çré Kåñëa, the primeval Lord and original Personality of Godhead. This earth is one of the innumerable material planets within the universe, and there are innumerable universes also within the compass of the mahat-tattva. The devotees are told by the Lord and His representatives, the spiritual masters or äcäryas, that not one of the planets within all the innumerable universes is suitable for the residential purposes of a devotee. The devotee always desires to go back home, back to Godhead, just to become one of the associates of the Lord in the capacity of servitor, friend, parent or conjugal lover of the Lord, either in one of the innumerable Vaikuëöha planets or in Goloka Våndävana, the planet of Lord Çré Kåñëa. All these planets are eternally situated in the spiritual sky, the paravyoma, which is on the other side of the Causal Ocean within the mahat-tattva. Mahäräja Parékñit was already aware of all this information due to his accumulated piety and birth in a high family of devotees, Vaiñëavas, and thus he was not at all interested in the material planets. Modern scientists are very eager to reach the moon by material arrangements, but they cannot conceive of the highest planet of this universe. But a devotee like Mahäräja Parékñit does not care a fig for the moon or, for that matter, any of the material planets. So when he was assured of his death on a fixed date, he became more determined in the transcendental loving service of Lord Kåñëa by complete fasting on the bank of the transcendental River Yamunä, which flows down by the capital of Hastinäpura (in the Delhi state). Both the Ganges and the Yamunä are amartyä (transcendental) rivers, and Yamunä is still more sanctified for the following reasons."
