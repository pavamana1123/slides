Such direct action is taken by the Lord in the case of a special devotee. Mahäräja Parékñit could understand this by the presence of the topmost transcendentalists in the universe. The Lord resides with His devotees, and therefore the presence of the great saints indicated the presence of the Lord. The King therefore welcomed the presence of the great åñis as a mark of favor of the Supreme Lord."
