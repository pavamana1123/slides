    "translation": "The river [Ganges, by which the King sat to fast] carries the most auspicious water, which is mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord and tulasé leaves. Therefore that water sanctifies the three worlds inside and outside and even sanctifies Lord Çiva and other demigods. Consequently everyone who is destined to die must take shelter of this river.",

            "content": "Mahäräja Parékñit, just after receiving the news of his death within seven days, at once retired from family life and shifted himself to the sacred bank of the Yamunä River. Generally it is said that the King took shelter on the bank of the Ganges, but according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the King took shelter on the bank of the Yamunä. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé's statement appears to be more accurate because of the geographical situation. Mahäräja Parékñit resided in his capital Hastinäpura, situated near present Delhi, and the River Yamunä flows down past the city. Naturally the King would take shelter of the River Yamunä because she was flowing past his palace door. And as far as sanctity is concerned, the River Yamunä is more directly connected with Lord Kåñëa than the Ganges. The Lord sanctified the River Yamunä from the beginning of His transcendental pastimes in the world. While His father Vasudeva was crossing the Yamunä with the baby Lord Kåñëa for a safe place at Gokula on the other bank of the river from Mathurä, the Lord fell down in the river, and by the dust of His lotus feet the river at once became sanctified. It is especially mentioned herein that Mahäräja Parékñit took shelter of that particular river which is beautifully flowing, carrying the dust of the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa, mixed with tulasé leaves. Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet are always besmeared with the tulasé leaves, and thus as soon as His lotus feet contact the water of the Ganges and the Yamunä, the rivers become at once sanctified. The Lord, however, contacted the River Yamunä more than the Ganges. According to the Varäha Puräëa, as quoted by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, there is no difference between the water of the Ganges and the Yamunä, but when the water of the Ganges is sanctified one hundred times, it is called the Yamunä. Similarly, it is said in the scriptures that one thousand names of Viñëu are equal to one name of Räma, and three names of Lord Räma are equal to one name of Kåñëa."
