He was a great sage, and his very dear wife was Pulomä. He could travel in space like Durväsä, Närada and others, and he used to visit all the planets of the universe. Before the Battle of Kurukñetra, he tried to stop the battle. Sometimes he instructed Bhäradväja Muni about astronomical evolution, and he is the author of the great Bhågu-saàhitä, the great astrological calculation. He explained how air, fire, water and earth are generated from ether. He explained how the air in the stomach works and regulates the intestines. As a great philosopher, he logically established the eternity of the living entity (Mahäbhärata). He was also a great anthropologist, and the theory of evolution was long ago explained by him. He was a scientific propounder of the four divisions and orders of human society known as the varëäçrama institution. He converted the kñatriya king Vétahavya into a brähmaëa."

He was in the womb of his mother when she was only twelve years old. And from within the womb of his mother he learned the Vedas. His father was killed by a demon, Kalmäñapäda, and to avenge this he wanted to annihilate the whole world. He was restrained, however, by his grandfather Vasiñöha. He then performed a Räkñasa-killing yajïa, but Maharñi Pulastya restrained him. He begot Vyäsadeva, being attracted by Satyavaté, who was to become the wife of Mahäräja Çäntanu. By the blessings of Paräçara, Satyavaté became fragrant for miles. He was present also during the time of Bhéñma's death. He was spiritual master of Mahäräja Janaka and a great devotee of Lord Çiva. He is the author of many Vedic scriptures and sociological directions."

He is famous as Gädhi-suta because his father was Gädhi, a powerful king of the province of Kanyäkubja (part of Uttara Pradesh). Although he was a kñatriya by birth, he became a brähmaëa in the very same body by the power of his spiritual achievements. He picked a quarrel with Vasiñöha Muni when he was a kñatriya king and performed a great sacrifice in cooperation with Maöaìga Muni and thus was able to vanquish the sons of Vasiñöha. He became a great yogé, and yet he failed to check his senses and thus was obliged to become the father of Çakuntalä, the beauty queen of world history. Once, when he was a kñatriya king, he visited the hermitage of Vasiñöha Muni, and he was given a royal reception. Viçvämitra wanted from Vasiñöha a cow named Nandiné, and the Muni refused to deliver it. Viçvämitra stole the cow, and thus there was a quarrel between the sage and the King. Viçvämitra was defeated by the spiritual strength of Vasiñöha, and thus the King decided to become a brähmaëa. Before becoming a brähmaëa he underwent severe austerity on the bank of the Kauçika. He was also one who tried to stop the Kurukñetra war."
