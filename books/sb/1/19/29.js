Çukadeva Gosvämé also exchanged the greetings and reception by embrace, shaking of hands, nodding and bowing down, especially before his father and Närada Muni. Thus he was offered the presidential seat at the meeting. When he was so received by the king and sages, the street boys and less intelligent women who followed him were struck with wonder and fear. So they retired from their frivolous activities, and everything was full of gravity and calm."
