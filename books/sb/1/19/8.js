Actually they came to meet Mahäräja Parékñit and not to take a bath of pilgrimage because all of them were competent enough to sanctify the places of pilgrimage. Common men go to pilgrimage sites to get themselves purified of all sins. Thus the places of pilgrimage become overburdened with the sins of others. But when such sages visit overburdened places of pilgrimage, they sanctify the places by their presence. Therefore the sages who came to meet Mahäräja Parékñit were not very much interested in getting themselves purified like common men, but on the plea of taking a bath in that place they came to meet Mahäräja Parékñit because they could foresee that Çrémad-Bhägavatam would be spoken by Çukadeva Gosvämé. All of them wanted to take advantage of the great occasion."
