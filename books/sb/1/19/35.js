Generally people are attached to family matters, and the whole economic impetus of human society is moving under the influence of family affection. Such deluded persons have no information that one can render better service to the family by becoming a devotee of the Lord. The Lord gives special protection to the family members and descendants of a devotee, even though such members are themselves nondevotees! Mahäräja Prahläda was a great devotee of the Lord, but his father, Hiraëyakaçipu, was a great atheist and declared enemy of the Lord. But despite all this, Hiraëyakaçipu was awarded salvation due to his being the father of Mahäräja Prahläda. The Lord is so kind that he gives all protection to the family members of His devotee, and thus the devotee has no need to bother about his family members, even if one leaves such family members aside to discharge devotional service. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and his brothers were the sons of Kunté, the paternal aunt of Lord Kåñëa, and Mahäräja Parékñit admits the patronage of Lord Kåñëa because of his being the only grandson of the great Päëòavas."
