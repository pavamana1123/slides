            "content": "The gesture now adopted by Mahäräja Parékñit of questioning a master is quite befitting in terms of scriptural injunctions. The scriptural injunction is that one should humbly approach a spiritual master to understand the transcendental science. Mahäräja Parékñit was now prepared for meeting his death, and within the very short time of seven days he was to know the process of entering the kingdom of God. In such important cases, one is required to approach a spiritual master. There is no necessity of approaching a spiritual master unless one is in need of solving the problems of life. One who does not know how to put questions before the spiritual master has no business seeing him. And the qualification of the spiritual master is perfectly manifested in the person of Çukadeva Gosvämé. Both the spiritual master and the disciple, namely Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé and Mahäräja Parékñit, attained perfection through the medium of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Çukadeva Gosvämé learned Çrémad-Bhägavatam from his father, Vyäsadeva, but he had no chance to recite it. Before Mahäräja Parékñit he recited Çrémad-Bhägavatam and answered the questions of Mahäräja Parékñit unhesitatingly, and thus both the master and the disciple got salvation."
