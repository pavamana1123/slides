Such Vaikuëöha planets are also differently known as the Puruñottamaloka, Acyutaloka, Trivikramaloka, Håñékeçaloka, Keçavaloka, Aniruddhaloka, Mädhavaloka, Pradyumnaloka, Saìkarñaëaloka, Çrédharaloka, Väsudevaloka, Ayodhyäloka, Dvärakäloka and many other millions of spiritual lokas wherein the Personality of Godhead predominates; all the living entities there are liberated souls with spiritual bodies as good as that of the Lord. There is no material contamination; everything there is spiritual, and therefore there is nothing objectively lamentable. They are full of transcendental bliss, and are without birth, death, old age and disease. And amongst all the above-mentioned Vaikuëöhalokas, there is one supreme loka called Goloka Våndävana, which is the abode of the Lord Çré Kåñëa and His specific associates. Mahäräja Parékñit was destined to achieve this particular loka, and the great åñis assembled there could foresee this. All of them consulted among themselves about the great departure of the great King, and they wanted to see him up to the last moment because they would no more be able to see such a great devotee of the Lord. When a great devotee of the Lord passes away, there is nothing to be lamented because the devotee is destined to enter into the kingdom of God. But the sorry plight is that such great devotees leave our sight, and therefore there is every reason to be sorry. As the Lord is rarely to be seen by our present eyes, so also are the great devotees. The great åñis, therefore, correctly decided to remain on the spot till the last moment."
