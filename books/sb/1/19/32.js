Mahäräja Pratäparudra was a follower of Lord Caitanya, but when he wanted to see the Lord, the Lord refused to see him because he was a king. For a devotee who desires to go back to Godhead, two things are strictly prohibited: worldly enjoyers and women. Therefore, devotees of the standard of Çukadeva Gosvämé are never interested in seeing kings. Mahäräja Parékñit was, of course, a different case. He was a great devotee, although a king, and therefore Çukadeva Gosvämé came to see him in his last stage of life. Mahäräja Parékñit, out of his devotional humility, felt himself an unworthy descendant of his great kñatriya forefathers, although he was as great as his predecessors. The unworthy sons of the royal orders are called kñatra-bandhavas, as the unworthy sons of the brähmaëas are called dvija-bandhus or brahma-bandhus. Mahäräja Parékñit was greatly encouraged by the presence of Çukadeva Gosvämé. He felt himself sanctified by the presence of the great saint whose presence turns any place into a place of pilgrimage."
