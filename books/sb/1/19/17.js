The seat of kuça straw is considered to be sanctified if the straw is taken out of the earth complete with root, and if the root is pointed toward the east it is considered to be auspicious. Facing the north is still more favorable for attaining spiritual success. Mahäräja Parékñit handed over the charge of administration to his son before leaving home. He was thus fully equipped for all favorable conditions."
