Çukadeva Gosvämé was not known as brahmarñi, räjarñi or devarñi, nor was he an incarnation like Närada, Vyäsa or Paraçuräma. And yet he excelled them in respects paid. This means that the devotee of the Lord is more honored in the world than the Lord Himself. One should therefore never minimize the importance of a devotee like Çukadeva Gosvämé."
