He marked his flag with the mark of a lion, and his grandfather marked his with the mark of Hanumänjé. A royal procession like that of Mahäräja Parékñit surrounded by well-decorated chariots, cavalry, elephants, infantry and band not only is pleasing to the eyes, but also is a sign of a civilization that is aesthetic even on the fighting front."
