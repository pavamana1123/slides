The distinction between human life and animal life therefore begins with the scientific system of varëa and äçrama, guided by the experience of the sages in relation with the demigods, gradually rising to the summit of reestablishing our eternal relation with the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa. When God-made varëäçrama-dharma, which is strictly meant for developing animal consciousness into human consciousness and human consciousness into godly consciousness, is broken by advancement of foolishness, the whole system of peaceful and progressive life is at once disturbed. In the age of Kali, the first attack of the venomous snake strikes against the God-made varëäçrama-dharma, and thus a person properly qualified as a brähmaëa is called a çüdra, and a çüdra by qualification is passing as a brähmaëa, all on a false birthright claim. To become a brähmaëa by a birthright claim is not at all bona fide, although it may be a fulfillment of one of the conditions. But the real qualification of a brähmaëa is to control the mind and the senses, and to cultivate tolerance, simplicity, cleanliness, knowledge, truthfulness, devotion and faith in the Vedic wisdom. In the present age, consideration of the necessary qualification is being neglected, and the false birthright claim is being supported even by a popular, sophisticated poet, the author of Räma-carita-mänasa."
