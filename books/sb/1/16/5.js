            "content": "Çaunaka and the åñis were astonished to hear that the pious Mahäräja Parékñit simply punished the culprit and did not kill him. This suggests that a pious king like Mahäräja Parékñit should have at once killed an offender who wanted to cheat the public by dressing like a king and at the same time daring to insult the purest of the animals, a cow. The åñis in those days, however, could not even imagine that in the advanced days of the age of Kali the lowest of the çüdras will be elected as administrators and will open organized slaughterhouses for killing cows. Anyway, although hearing about a çüdraka who was a cheat and insulter of a cow was not very interesting to the great åñis, they nevertheless wanted to hear about it to see if the event had any connection with Lord Kåñëa. They were simply interested in the topics of Lord Kåñëa, for anything that is dovetailed with the narration of Kåñëa is worth hearing. There are many topics in the Bhägavatam about sociology, politics, economics, cultural affairs, etc., but all of them are in relation with Kåñëa, and therefore all of them are worth hearing. Kåñëa is the purifying ingredient in all matters, regardless of what they are. In the mundane world, everything is impure due to its being a product of the three mundane qualities. The purifying agent, however, is Kåñëa."
