The surest remedy for avoiding death is to accustom oneself to hearing the nectarean pastimes of the Lord as they are systematically narrated in the text of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. It is advised herein, therefore, that any human being who desires freedom from death should take to this course of life as recommended by the åñis headed by Çaunaka."
