The Battle of Kurukñetra is full of politics and diplomacy, but because the topics are related with Lord Kåñëa, the Bhagavad-gétä is therefore adored all over the world. There is no need to eradicate politics, economics, sociology, etc., which are mundane to the mundaners. To a pure devotee, who is actually related with the Lord, such mundane things are transcendental if dovetailed with the Lord or with His pure devotees. We have heard and talked about the activities of the Päëòavas, and we now are dealing with the topics of Mahäräja Parékñit, but because all these topics are related to the Lord Çré Kåñëa, they are all transcendental, and pure devotees have great interest in hearing them. We have already discussed this matter in connection with the prayers of Bhéñmadeva."

Thus it is our duty to see that not a moment of our life is wasted in topics which are not related with Lord Kåñëa. Any topic, however pleasant, is not worth hearing if it is devoid of its relation to Kåñëa."

Even when the Lord descends to any one of the mundane planets, He does so by manifesting His own abode as it is. Thus His feet remain always on the same big whorl of the lotus flower. His feet are also as beautiful as the lotus flower. Therefore it is said that Lord Kåñëa has lotus feet."

Freed from such material energy, a living entity is liberated and is eligible to return home, back to Godhead. Those who want to live forever without changing their material bodies should not waste valuable time with topics other than those relating to Lord Kåñëa and His devotees."
