Irävaté, being the daughter of Mahäräja Uttara, was the cousin-sister of Mahäräja Parékñit, but cousin-brothers and -sisters were allowed to get married if they did not belong to the same gotra, or family. In the Vedic system of marriage, the importance of the gotra, or family, was stressed. Arjuna also married Subhadrä, although she was his maternal cousin-sister."

            "content": "<br/>Janamejaya: One of the räjarñi kings and the famous son of Mahäräja Parékñit. His mother's name was Irävaté, or according to some, Mädravaté. Mahäräja Janamejaya begot two sons of the names Jïätänéka and Çaìkukarëa. He celebrated several sacrifices in the Kurukñetra pilgrimage site, and he had three younger brothers named Çrutasena, Ugrasena and Bhémasena II. He invaded Takñaçilä (Ajanta), and he decided to avenge the unlawful curse upon his great father, Mahäräja Parékñit. He performed a great sacrifice called Sarpa-yajïa, to kill the race of serpents, including the takñaka, which had bitten his father to death. On request from many influential demigods and sages, he had to change his decision to kill the race of snakes, but despite stopping the sacrifice, he satisfied everyone concerned in the sacrifice by rewarding them properly. In the ceremony, Mahämuni Vyäsadeva also was present, and he personally narrated the history of the Battle of Kurukñetra before the King. Later on by the order of Vyäsadeva, his disciple Vaiçampäyana narrated before the King the subject matter of Mahäbhärata. He was much affected by his great father's untimely death and was very anxious to see him again, and he expressed his desire before the great sage Vyäsadeva. Vyäsadeva also fulfilled his desire. His father was present before him, and he worshiped both his father and Vyäsadeva with great respect and pomp. Being fully satisfied, he most munificently gave charities to the brähmaëas present at the sacrifice."
