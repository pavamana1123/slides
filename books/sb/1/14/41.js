Similarly, the children of the state, the cow, the diseased person, the woman and the old man specifically require the protection of the state or a kñatriya king. If such living beings do not get protection by the kñatriya, or the royal order, or by the state, it is certainly shameful for the kñatriya or the state. If such things had actually happened to Arjuna, Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was anxious to know about these discrepancies."
