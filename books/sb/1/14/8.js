In Bhagavad-gétä there are different statements by the Lord, and each of these statements is meant for different plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions. For example, Çré Kåñëa, the Lord, says in Bhagavad-gétä:"

            "content": "All the above statements by the Lord apply to different plenary portions of the Lord, namely His expansions such as Saìkarñaëa, Väsudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Näräyaëa. These are all He Himself in different transcendental expansions, and still the Lord as Çré Kåñëa functions in a different sphere of transcendental exchange with different grades of devotees. And yet Lord Kåñëa as He is appears once every twenty-four hours of Brahmä's time (or after a lapse of 8,640,000,000 solar years) in each and every universe, and all His transcendental pastimes are displayed in each and every universe in a routine spool. But in that routine spool the functions of Lord Kåñëa, Lord Väsudeva, etc., are complex problems for the layman. There is no difference between the Lord's Self and the Lord's transcendental body. The expansions execute differential activities. When the Lord, however, appears in His person as Lord Çré Kåñëa, His other plenary portions also join in Him by His inconceivable potency called yogamäyä, and thus the Lord Kåñëa of Våndävana is different from the Lord Kåñëa of Mathurä or the Lord Kåñëa of Dvärakä. The viräö-rüpa of Lord Kåñëa is also different from Him, by His inconceivable potency. The viräö-rüpa exhibited on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra is the material conception of His form. Therefore it should be understood that when Lord Kåñëa was apparently killed by the bow and arrow of the hunter, the Lord left His so-called material body in the material world. The Lord is kaivalya, and for Him there is no difference between matter and spirit because everything is created from Him. Therefore His quitting one sort of body or accepting another body does not mean that He is like the ordinary living being. All such activities are simultaneously one and different by His inconceivable potency. When Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was lamenting the possibility of His disappearance, it was just in pursuance of a custom of lamenting the disappearance of a great friend, but factually the Lord never quits His transcendental body, as is misconceived by less intelligent persons. Such less intelligent persons have been condemned by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä, and they are known as the müòhas. That the Lord left His body means that He left again His plenary portions in the respective dhämas (transcendental abodes), as He left His viräö-rüpa in the material world."
