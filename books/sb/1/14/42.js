            "content": "It appears from this verse that during the time of the Päëòavas free contact between man and woman was allowed in certain conditions only. The higher-caste men, namely the brähmaëas and kñatriyas, could accept a woman of the vaiçya or the çüdra community, but a man from the lower castes could not contact a woman of the higher caste. Even a kñatriya could not contact a woman of the brähmaëa caste. The wife of a brähmaëa is considered one of the seven mothers (namely one's own mother, the wife of the spiritual master or teacher, the wife of a brähmaëa, the wife of a king, the cow, the nurse, and the earth). Such contact between man and woman was known as uttama and adhama. Contact of a brähmaëa with a kñatriya woman is uttama, but the contact of a kñatriya with a brähmaëa woman is adhama and therefore condemned. A woman approaching a man for contact should never be refused, but at the same time the discretion as above mentioned may also be considered. Bhéma was approached by Hiòimbé from a community lower than the çüdras, and Yayäti refused to marry the daughter of Çukräcärya because of Çukräcärya's being a brähmaëa. Vyäsadeva, a brähmaëa, was called to beget Päëòu and Dhåtaräñöra. Satyavaté belonged to a family of fishermen, but Paräçara, a great brähmaëa, begot in her Vyäsadeva. So there are so many examples of contacts with woman, but in all cases the contacts were not abominable nor were the results of such contacts bad. Contact between man and woman is natural, but that also must be carried out under regulative principles so that social consecration may not be disturbed or unwanted worthless population be increased for the unrest of the world."

            "content": "<br/>It is abominable for a kñatriya to be defeated by one who is inferior in strength or equal in strength. If one is defeated at all, he should be defeated by some superior power. Arjuna was defeated by Bhéñmadeva, and Lord Kåñëa saved him from the danger. This was not an insult for Arjuna because Bhéñmadeva was far superior to Arjuna in all ways, namely age, respect and strength. But Karëa was equal to Arjuna, and therefore Arjuna was in crisis when fighting with Karëa. It was felt by Arjuna, and therefore Karëa was killed even by crooked means. Such are the engagements of the kñatriyas, and Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira inquired from his brother whether anything undesirable happened on the way home from Dvärakä."
