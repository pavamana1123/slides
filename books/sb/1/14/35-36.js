            "content": "As we have discussed many times, the Personality of Godhead Viñëu resides within each and every universe in two capacities, namely as the Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and the Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. The Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu has His own planet on the northern top of the universe, and there is a great ocean of milk where the Lord resides on the bed of the Ananta incarnation of Baladeva. Thus Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira has compared the Yadu dynasty to the ocean of milk and Çré Balaräma to the Ananta where Lord Kåñëa resides. He has compared the citizens of Dvärakä to the liberated inhabitants of the Vaikuëöhalokas. Beyond the material sky, further than we can see with our eyes and beyond the sevenfold coverings of the universe, there is the Causal Ocean in which all the universes are floating like footballs, and beyond the Causal Ocean there is an unlimited span of spiritual sky generally known as the effulgence of Brahman. Within this effulgence there are innumerable spiritual planets, and they are known as the Vaikuëöha planets. Each and every Vaikuëöha planet is many, many times bigger than the biggest universe within the material world, and in each of them there are innumerable inhabitants who look exactly like Lord Viñëu. These inhabitants are known as the Mahä-pauruñikas, or persons directly engaged in the service of the Lord. They are happy in those planets and are without any kind of misery, and they live perpetually in full youthfulness, enjoying life in full bliss and knowledge without fear of birth, death, old age or disease, and without the influence of käla, eternal time. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira has compared the inhabitants of Dvärakä to the Mahä-pauruñikas of Vaikuëöhaloka because they are so happy with the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gétä there are many references to the Vaikuëöhalokas, and they are mentioned there as mad-dhäma, or the kingdom of the Lord."
