Thus the queens enjoy things which are prerogatives of the wives of the controller of thunderbolts.",

            "content": "Satyabhämä: One of the principal queens of Lord Çré Kåñëa at Dvärakä. After killing Narakäsura, Lord Kåñëa visited the palace of Narakäsura accompanied by Satyabhämä. He went to Indraloka also with Satyabhämä, and she was received by Çacédevé, who introduced her to the mother of the demigods, Aditi. Aditi was very much pleased with Satyabhämä, and she blessed her with the benediction of permanent youth as long as Lord Kåñëa remained on the earth. Aditi also took her with her to show her the special prerogatives of the demigods in the heavenly planets. When Satyabhämä saw the pärijäta flower, she desired to have it in her palace at Dvärakä. After that, she came back to Dvärakä along with her husband and expressed her willingness to have the pärijäta flower at her palace. Satyabhämä's palace was especially bedecked with valuable jewels, and even in the hottest season of summer the inside of the palace remained cool, as if air-conditioned. She decorated her palace with various flags, heralding the news of her great husband's presence there. Once, along with her husband, she met Draupadé, and she was anxious to be instructed by Draupadé in the ways and means of pleasing her husband. Draupadé was expert in this affair because she kept five husbands, the Päëòavas, and all were very much pleased with her. On receipt of Draupadé's instructions, she was very much pleased and offered her good wishes and returned to Dvärakä. She was the daughter of Saträjit. After the departure of Lord Kåñëa, when Arjuna visited Dvärakä, all the queens, including Satyabhämä and Rukmiëé, lamented for the Lord with great feeling. At the last stage of her life, she left for the forest to undergo severe penance."

            "content": "Satyabhämä instigated her husband to get the pärijäta flower from the heavenly planets, and the Lord got it even by force from the demigods, as a common husband secures things to please his wife. As already explained, the Lord had very little to do with so many wives to carry out their orders like an ordinary man. But because the queens accepted the high quality of devotional service, namely administering the Lord all comforts, the Lord played the part of a faithful and complete husband. No earthly creature can expect to have things from the heavenly kingdom, especially the pärijäta flowers, which are simply to be used by the demigods. But due to their becoming the Lord's faithful wives, all of them enjoyed the special prerogatives of the great wives of the denizens of heaven. In other words, since the Lord is the proprietor of everything within His creation, it is not very astonishing for the queens of Dvärakä to have any rare thing from any part of the universe."
