            "content": "Hastinäpura, the capital of the Päëòavas, was situated somewhere near present New Delhi, and the kingdom of Ugrasena was situated in Mathurä. While returning to Delhi from Dvärakä, Arjuna must have visited the city of Mathurä, and therefore the inquiry about the King of Mathurä is valid. Amongst various names of the relatives, the name of Räma or Balaräma, eldest brother of Lord Kåñëa, is added with the words \"the Personality of Godhead\" because Lord Balaräma is the immediate expansion of viñëu-tattva as prakäça-vigraha of Lord Kåñëa. The Supreme Lord, although one without a second, expands Himself as many other living beings. The viñëu-tattva living beings are expansions of the Supreme Lord, and all of them are qualitatively and quantitatively equal with the Lord. But expansions of the jéva-çakti, the category of the ordinary living beings, are not at all equal with the Lord. One who considers the jéva-çakti and the viñëu-tattva to be on an equal level is considered a condemned soul of the world. Çré Räma, or Balaräma, is the protector of the devotees of the Lord. Baladeva acts as the spiritual master of all devotees, and by His causeless mercy the fallen souls are delivered. Çré Baladeva appeared as Çré Nityänanda Prabhu during the advent of Lord Caitanya, and the great Lord Nityänanda Prabhu exhibited His causeless mercy by delivering a pair of extremely fallen souls, namely Jagäi and Mädhäi. Therefore it is particularly mentioned herein that Balaräma is the protector of the devotees of the Lord. By His divine grace only one can approach the Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa, and thus Çré Balaräma is the mercy incarnation of the Lord, manifested as the spiritual master, the savior of the pure devotees."
