The darkness of the planet is, however, removed by the flashes of the jewels set on the heads of the Nägas (celestial serpents), and it is said that there are beautiful gardens, rivulets, etc., for the enjoyment of the Nägas. It is understood here also that the place is well protected by the inhabitants. So also the city of Dvärakä was well protected by the descendants of Våñëi, who were as powerful as the Lord, insofar as He manifested His strength upon this earth."
