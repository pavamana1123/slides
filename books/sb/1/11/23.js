When they were old invalids, they used to approach the assembly of the kings, and simply by praising the glorious deeds performed by the kings, along with their wives, they would be provided with all necessities of life. Such brähmaëas were not, so to speak, flatterers of the kings, but the kings were actually glorified by their actions, and they were sincerely still more encouraged in pious acts by such brähmaëas in a dignified way. Lord Çré Kåñëa is worthy of all glories, and the praying brähmaëas and others were glorified themselves by chanting the glories of the Lord."
