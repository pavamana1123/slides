Subhadrä was married with her cousin Arjuna, and this system is still prevalent in some parts of India. Vasudeva was appointed minister of Ugrasena, and later on he married eight daughters of Ugrasena's brother Devaka. Devaké is only one of them. Kaàsa was his brother-in-law, and Vasudeva accepted voluntary imprisonment by Kaàsa on mutual agreement to deliver the eighth son of Devaké. This was foiled by the will of Kåñëa. As maternal uncle of the Päëòavas, he took active parts in the purificatory process of the Päëòavas. He sent for the priest Kaçyapa at the Çatasåìga Parvata, and he executed the functions. When Kåñëa appeared within the bars of Kaàsa's prison house, He was transferred by Vasudeva to the house of Nanda Mahäräja, the foster father of Kåñëa, at Gokula. Kåñëa disappeared along with Baladeva prior to the disappearance of Vasudeva, and Arjuna (Vasudeva's nephew) undertook the charge of the funeral ceremony after Vasudeva's disappearance."

Akrüra attained success in devotional service to the Lord by the one single process of offering prayers. He was the husband of Sütané, daughter of Ahüka. He supported Arjuna when Arjuna took Subhadrä forcibly away by the will of Kåñëa. Both Kåñëa and Akrüra went to see Arjuna after his successful kidnapping of Subhadrä. Both of them presented dowries to Arjuna after this incidence. Akrüra was present also when Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadrä, was married with Uttarä, mother of Mahäräja Parékñit. Ahüka, the father-in-law of Akrüra, was not on good terms with Akrüra. But both of them were devotees of the Lord."

His minister was Vasudeva, and his son was the powerful Kaàsa. This Kaàsa imprisoned his father and became the King of Mathurä. By the grace of Lord Kåñëa and His brother, Lord Baladeva, Kaàsa was killed, and Ugrasena was reinstalled on the throne. When Çälva attacked the city of Dvärakä, Ugrasena fought very valiantly and repulsed the enemy. Ugrasena inquired from Näradajé about the divinity of Lord Kåñëa. When the Yadu dynasty was to be vanquished, Ugrasena was entrusted with the iron lump produced from the womb of Sämba. He cut the iron lump into pieces and then pasted it and mixed it up with the sea water on the coast of Dvärakä. After this, he ordered complete prohibition within the city of Dvärakä and the kingdom. He got salvation after his death."

            "content": "Baladeva: He is the divine son of Vasudeva by his wife Rohiëé. He is also known as Rohiëé-nandana, the beloved son of Rohiëé. He was also entrusted to Nanda Mahäräja along with His mother, Rohiëé, when Vasudeva embraced imprisonment by mutual agreement with Kaàsa. So Nanda Mahäräja is also the foster father of Baladeva along with Lord Kåñëa. Lord Kåñëa and Lord Baladeva were constant companions from Their very childhood, although They were stepbrothers. He is the plenary manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He is as good and powerful as Lord Kåñëa. He belongs to the viñëu-tattva (the principle of Godhead). He attended the svayaàvara ceremony of Draupadé along with Çré Kåñëa. When Subhadrä was kidnapped by Arjuna by the organized plan of Çré Kåñëa, Baladeva was very angry with Arjuna and wanted to kill him at once. Çré Kåñëa, for the sake of His dear friend, fell at the feet of Lord Baladeva and implored Him not to be so angry. Çré Baladeva was thus satisfied. Similarly, He was once very angry with the Kauravas, and He wanted to throw their whole city into the depths of the Yamunä. But the Kauravas satisfied Him by surrendering unto His divine lotus feet. He was actually the seventh son of Devaké prior to the birth of Lord Kåñëa, but by the will of the Lord He was transferred to the womb of Rohiëé to escape the wrath of Kaàsa. His other name is therefore Saìkarñaëa, who is also the plenary portion of Çré Baladeva. Because He is as powerful as Lord Kåñëa and can bestow spiritual power to the devotees, He is therefore known as Baladeva. In the Vedas also it is enjoined that no one can know the Supreme Lord without being favored by Baladeva. Bala means spiritual strength not physical. Some less intelligent persons interpret bala as the strength of the body. But no one can have spiritual realization by physical strength. Physical strength ends with the end of the physical body, but spiritual strength follows the spirit soul to the next transmigration, and therefore the strength obtained by Baladeva is never wasted. The strength is eternal, and thus Baladeva is the original spiritual master of all devotees."

In His childhood He killed many asuras along with Çré Kåñëa, and specifically He killed the Dhenukäsura at Tälavana. During the Kurukñetra battle, He remained neutral, and He tried His best not to bring about the fight. He was in favor of Duryodhana, but still He remained neutral. When there was a club-fight between Duryodhana and Bhémasena, He was present on the spot. He was angry at Bhémasena when the latter struck Duryodhana on the thigh or below the belt, and He wanted to retaliate the unfair action. Lord Çré Kåñëa saved Bhéma from His wrath. But He left the place at once, being disgusted at Bhémasena, and after His departure Duryodhana fell to the ground to meet his death. The funeral ceremony of Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, was performed by Him, as He was the maternal uncle. It was impossible to be performed by any one of the Päëòavas, who were all overwhelmed with grief. At the last stage, He departed from this world by producing a great white snake from His mouth, and thus He was carried by Çeñanäga in the shape of a serpent."

He was one of those who went to congratulate Arjuna upon his marrying Subhadrä. He was one of the great generals who fought with Çälva, and while fighting with him he became unconscious on the battlefield. His charioteer brought him back to the camp from the battlefield, and for this action he was very sorry and rebuked his charioteer. However, he fought again with Çälva and was victorious. He heard all about the different demigods from Näradajé. He is one of the four plenary expansions of Lord Çré Kåñëa. He is the third one. He inquired from his father, Çré Kåñëa, about the glories of the brähmaëas. During the fratricidal war amongst the descendants of Yadu, he died at the hand of Bhoja, another king of the Våñëis.

He was present during the Räjasüya-yajïa of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. When all the Våñëis were assembled during the time of Prabhäsa-yajïa, his glorious activities were narrated by Sätyaki before Lord Baladeva. He was also present along with his father, Lord Çré Kåñëa, during the Açvamedha-yajïa performed by Yudhiñöhira. He was presented before some åñis falsely dressed as a pregnant woman by his brothers, and in fun he asked the åñis what he was going to deliver. The åñis replied that he would deliver a lump of iron, which would be the cause of fratricidal war in the family of Yadu. The next day, in the morning, Sämba delivered a large lump of iron, which was entrusted with Ugrasena for necessary action. Actually later on there was the foretold fratricidal war, and Sämba died in that war."
