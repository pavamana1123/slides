All were very anxious to have an audience with the Lord, although because of spiritual contact they were never separated from the Lord. Just as the gopés at Våndävana used to think of Kåñëa while He was away from the village for cowherding engagements, the citizens of Dvärakä were all immersed in thought of the Lord while He was away from Dvärakä to attend the Battle of Kurukñetra. Some distinguished fiction writer in Bengal concluded that the Kåñëa of Våndävana, that of Mathurä and that of Dvärakä were different personalities. Historically there is no truth in this conclusion. The Kåñëa of Kurukñetra and the Kåñëa of Dvärakä are one and the same personality."

The sound heralded by Lord Kåñëa was something like the heralding of the sunrise in the morning. So all the citizens of Dvärakä awoke from a state of slumber because of the sunrise of Kåñëa, and they all hastened towards Him just to have an audience. The devotees of the Lord know no one else as protector."

The material existence of our present status is full of fear. Out of the four problems of material existence, namely the food problem, the shelter problem, the fear problem and the mating problem, the fear problem gives us more trouble than the others. We are always fearful due to our ignorance of the next problem. The whole material existence is full of problems, and thus the fear problem is always prominent. This is due to our association with the illusory energy of the Lord, known as mäyä or external energy, yet all fear is vanished as soon as there is the sound of the Lord, represented by His holy name, as it was sounded by Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu in the following sixteen words:"
