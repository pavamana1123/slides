There are four classes of good men, and there are four classes of bad men also. The four classes of good men acknowledge the authority of the Almighty God, and therefore such good men (1) when they are in difficulty, (2) when they are in need of money, (3) when they are advanced in knowledge and (4) when they are inquisitive to know more and more about God, intuitively take shelter of the Lord. As such, Näradajé advises Vyäsadeva to broadcast the transcendental knowledge of God in terms of the vast Vedic knowledge which he had already attained."
