The Lord has expanded Himself as living beings in order to accept loving service from them, and this alone can satisfy both the Lord and the living beings. Such a scholar as Vyäsadeva has completed many expansions of the Vedic literatures, ending with the Vedänta philosophy, but none of them have been written directly glorifying the Personality of Godhead. Dry philosophical speculations even on the transcendental subject of the Absolute have very little attraction without directly dealing with the glorification of the Lord. The Personality of Godhead is the last word in transcendental realization. The Absolute realized as impersonal Brahman or localized Supersoul, Paramätmä, is less productive of transcendental bliss than the supreme personal realization of His glories."

            "content": "The compiler of the Vedänta-darçana is Vyäsadeva himself. Yet he is troubled, although he is the author. So what sort of transcendental bliss can be derived by the readers and listeners of Vedänta which is not explained directly by Vyäsadeva, the author? Herein arises the necessity of explaining Vedänta-sütra in the form of Çrémad-Bhägavatam by the self-same author."
