Such a devotee of the Lord in full perfection of devotional service is also perfect by the qualification of the Personality of Godhead. As such, the eightfold perfections of mystic power (añöa-siddhi) constitute very little of his godly opulence. A devotee like Närada can act wonderfully by his spiritual perfection, which every individual is trying to attain. Çréla Närada is a cent-percent perfect living being, although not equal to the Personality of Godhead."
