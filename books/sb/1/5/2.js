Vyäsadeva, as the descendant of Paräçara, a greatly powerful sage, had the privilege of having a great parentage which should not have given Vyäsadeva cause for despondency. Being a great son of a great father, he should not have identified the self with the body or the mind. Ordinary men with a poor fund of knowledge can identify the body as self or the mind as self, but Vyäsadeva should not have done so. One cannot be cheerful by nature unless one is factually seated in self-realization, which is transcendental to the material body and mind."
