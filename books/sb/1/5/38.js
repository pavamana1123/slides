He is therefore worshiped by sound representation via the transcendental method of chanting. Anything which is beyond the scope of experience by our imperfect senses can be realized fully by the sound representation. A person transmitting sound from a far distant place can be factually experienced. If this is materially possible, why not spiritually? This experience is not a vague impersonal experience. It is actually an experience of the transcendental Personality of Godhead, who possesses the pure form of eternity, bliss and knowledge."

            "content": "In the Amarakoça Sanskrit dictionary the word mürti carries import in twofold meanings, namely, form and difficulty. Therefore amürtikam is explained by Äcärya Çré Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura as meaning \"without difficulty.\" The transcendental form of eternal bliss and knowledge can be experienced by our original spiritual senses, which can be revived by chanting of the holy mantras, or transcendental sound representations. Such sound should be received from the transparent agency of the bona fide spiritual master, and the chanting may be practiced by the direction of the spiritual master. That will gradually lead us nearer to the Lord. This method of worship is recommended in the päïcarätrika system, which is both recognized and authorized. The päïcarätrika system has the most authorized codes for transcendental devotional service. Without the help of such codes, one cannot approach the Lord, certainly not by dry philosophical speculation. The päïcarätrika system is both practical and suitable for this age of quarrel. The Païcarätra is more important than the Vedänta for this modern age."
