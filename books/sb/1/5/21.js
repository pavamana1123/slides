            "content": "Çréla Vyäsadeva is the empowered plenary portion incarnation of the Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. He descended by his causeless mercy to deliver the fallen souls in the material world. The fallen and forgotten souls are detached from the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and they are eternally servitors of the Lord. All the Vedic literatures, therefore, are put into systematic order for the benefit of the fallen souls, and it is the duty of the fallen souls to take advantage of such literatures and be freed from the bondage of material existence. Although formally Çréla Närada Åñi is his spiritual master, Çréla Vyäsadeva is not at all dependent on a spiritual master because in essence he is the spiritual master of everyone else. But because he is doing the work of an äcärya, he has taught us by his own conduct that one must have a spiritual master, even though he be God Himself. Lord Çré Kåñëa, Lord Çré Räma and Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, all incarnations of Godhead, accepted formal spiritual masters, although by Their transcendental nature They were cognizant of all knowledge. In order to direct people in general to the lotus feet of Lord Çré Kåñëa, He Himself in the incarnation of Vyäsadeva is delineating the transcendental pastimes of the Lord."
