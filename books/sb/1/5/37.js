Väsudeva and Saìkarñaëa are on the middle left and right, Pradyumna is on the right of Saìkarñaëa, and Aniruddha is on the left of Väsudeva, and thus the four Deities are situated.

Näradajé has therefore explained the nature of unalloyed devotional service by his personal experience in the development of intimacy between the Lord and the living entity by a gradual process of progressive devotional activities. Such a progressive march of transcendental devotion for the Lord culminates in the attainment of loving service of the Lord, which is called premä in different transcendental variegatedness called rasas (tastes). Such devotional service is also executed in mixed forms, namely mixed with fruitive work or empiric philosophical speculations."

And this mantra is addressed to the four Deities, or the Lord with His plenary expansions. The central figure is Lord Çré Kåñëa because the plenary portions are His aides-de-camp. The most confidential part of the instruction is that one should always chant and remember the glories of the Lord Çré Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with His different plenary portions expanded as Väsudeva, Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Those expansions are the original Deities for all other truths, namely either viñëu-tattva or çakti-tattvas."
