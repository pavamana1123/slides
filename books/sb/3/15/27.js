    "translation": "After passing through the six entrances of Vaikuëöha-puré, the Lord's residence, without feeling astonishment at all the decorations, they saw at the seventh gate two shining beings of the same age, armed with maces and adorned with most valuable jewelry, earrings, diamonds, helmets, garments, etc.",

But at the seventh door they found two doormen of the same age. The significance of the doormen's being of the same age is that in the Vaikuëöha planets there is no old age, so one cannot distinguish who is older than whom. The inhabitants of Vaikuëöha are decorated like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, with çaìkha, cakra, gadä and padma (conch, wheel, club and lotus)."
