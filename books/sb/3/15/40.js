The Lord's personal body was covered with yellow robes, and His waist was thin. In Vaikuëöha, whenever there is a flower garland on the chest of the Personality of Godhead or any one of His associates, it is described that the humming bees are there. All these features were very beautiful and attractive for the devotees. One of the Lord's hands rested on His carrier, Garuòa, and in another hand He twirled a lotus flower. These are personal characteristics of the Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa."
