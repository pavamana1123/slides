Therefore Brahmä is the original source of all scientific knowledge. He is born directly from the transcendental body of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who is never seen by any creature of this material universe and therefore always remains unmanifested. Brahmä is stated here to be born of the unmanifested. He is the incarnation of the mode of passion in material nature, which is the separated, external energy of the Supreme Lord."
