    "translation": "The sages, headed by Sanaka Åñi, saw that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, who was formerly visible only within their hearts in ecstatic trance, had now actually become visible to their eyes. As He came forward, accompanied by His own associates bearing all paraphernalia, such as an umbrella and a cämara fan, the white bunches of hair moved very gently, like two swans, and due to their favorable breeze the pearls garlanding the umbrella also moved, like drops of nectar falling from the white full moon or ice melting due to a gust of wind.",

            "content": "In this verse we find the word acakñatäkña-viñayam. The Supreme Lord cannot be seen by ordinary eyes, but He now became visible to the eyesight of the Kumäras. Another significant word is samädhi-bhägyam. Meditators who are very fortunate can see the Viñëu form of the Lord within their hearts by following the yogic process. But to see Him face to face is a different matter. This is only possible for pure devotees. The Kumäras, therefore, upon seeing the Lord coming forward with His associates, who were holding an umbrella and a cämara fan, were struck with wonder that they were seeing the Lord face to face. It is said in the Brahma-saàhitä that devotees, being elevated in love of God, always see Çyämasundara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, within their hearts. But when they are mature, the same God is visible before them face to face. For ordinary persons the Lord is not visible; however, when one can understand the significance of His holy name and one engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord, beginning with the tongue, by chanting and tasting prasäda, then gradually the Lord reveals Himself. Thus the devotee constantly sees the Lord within his heart, and, in a more mature stage, one can see the same Lord directly, as we see everything else."
