    "translation": "Although flowering plants like the mandära, kunda, kurabaka, utpala, campaka, arëa, punnäga, nägakeçara, bakula, lily and pärijäta are full of transcendental fragrance, they are still conscious of the austerities performed by tulasé, for tulasé is given special preference by the Lord, who garlands Himself with tulasé leaves.",

Devotees are recommended to water the tulasé tree every day and collect the leaves to worship the Lord. One time an atheistic svämé remarked, \"What is the use of watering the tulasé plant? It is better to water eggplant. By watering the eggplant one can get some fruits, but what is the use of watering the tulasé?\" These foolish creatures, unacquainted with devotional service, sometimes play havoc with the education of people in general."

This is true even among the flowers, which are all conscious of the greatness of tulasé. In the Vaikuëöha world entered by the four Kumäras, even the birds and flowers are conscious of service to the Lord."
