    "translation": "When the doormen of Vaikuëöhaloka, who were certainly devotees of the Lord, found that they were going to be cursed by the brähmaëas, they at once became very much afraid and fell down at the feet of the brähmaëas in great anxiety, for a brähmaëa's curse cannot be counteracted by any kind of weapon.",

There are many kinds of offenses, but the greatest offense is to offend a devotee of the Lord. Because the doormen were also devotees of the Lord, they were able to understand their mistake and were terrified when the four Kumäras were ready to curse them."
