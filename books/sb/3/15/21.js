    "translation": "The ladies in the Vaikuëöha planets are as beautiful as the goddess of fortune herself. Such transcendentally beautiful ladies, their hands playing with lotuses and their leg bangles tinkling, are sometimes seen sweeping the marble walls, which are bedecked at intervals with golden borders, in order to receive the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

Lakñmé-sahasra-çata-sambhrama-sevyamänam (BS 5.29). These millions and trillions of goddesses of fortune who reside in the Vaikuëöha planets are not exactly consorts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but are the wives of the devotees of the Lord and also engage in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is stated here that in the Vaikuëöha planets the houses are made of marble. Similarly, in the Brahma-saàhitä it is stated that the ground on the Vaikuëöha planets is made of touchstone. Thus there is no need to sweep the stone in Vaikuëöha, for there is hardly any dust on it, but still, in order to satisfy the Lord, the ladies there always engage in dusting the marble walls. Why? The reason is that they are eager to achieve the grace of the Lord by doing so."

            "content": "It is also stated here that in the Vaikuëöha planets the goddesses of fortune are faultless. Generally the goddess of fortune does not remain steadily in one place. Her name is Caïcalä, which means \"one who is not steady.\" We find, therefore, that a man who is very rich may become the poorest of the poor. Another example is Rävaëa. Rävaëa took away Lakñmé, Sétäjé, to his kingdom, and instead of being happy by the grace of Lakñmé, his family and his kingdom were vanquished. Thus Lakñmé in the house of Rävaëa is Caïcalä, or unsteady. Men of Rävaëa's class want Lakñmé only, without her husband, Näräyaëa; therefore they become unsteady due to Lakñméjé. Materialistic persons find fault on the part of Lakñmé, but in Vaikuëöha Lakñméjé is fixed in the service of the Lord. In spite of her being the goddess of fortune, she cannot be happy without the grace of the Lord. Even the goddess of fortune needs the Lord's grace in order to be happy, yet in the material world even Brahmä, the highest created being, seeks the favor of Lakñmé for happiness."
