    "translation": "The exquisite beauty of Näräyaëa, being many times magnified by the intelligence of His devotees, was so attractive that it defeated the pride of the goddess of fortune in being the most beautiful. My dear demigods, the Lord who thus manifested Himself is worshipable by me, by Lord Çiva and by all of you. The sages regarded Him with unsated eyes and joyously bowed their heads at His lotus feet.",

            "content": "The beauty of the Lord was so enchanting that it could not be sufficiently described. The goddess of fortune is supposed to be the most beautiful sight within the spiritual and material creations of the Lord; she has a sense of being the most beautiful, yet her beauty was defeated when the Lord appeared. In other words, the beauty of the goddess of fortune is secondary in the presence of the Lord. In the words of Vaiñëava poets, it is said that the Lord's beauty is so enchanting that it defeats hundreds of thousands of Cupids. He is therefore called Madana-mohana. It is also described that the Lord sometimes becomes mad after the beauty of Rädhäräëé. Poets describe that under those circumstances, although Lord Kåñëa is Madana-mohana, He becomes Madana-däha, or enchanted by the beauty of Rädhäräëé. Actually the Lord's beauty is superexcellent, surpassing even the beauty of Lakñmé in Vaikuëöha. The devotees of the Lord in the Vaikuëöha planets want to see the Lord as the most beautiful, but the devotees in Gokula or Kåñëaloka want to see Rädhäräëé as more beautiful than Kåñëa. The adjustment is that the Lord, being bhakta-vatsala, or one who wants to please His devotees, assumes such features so that devotees like Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and other demigods may be pleased. Here also, for the devotee-sages, the Kumäras, the Lord appeared in His most beautiful feature, and they continued to see Him without satiation and wanted to continue seeing Him more and more."
