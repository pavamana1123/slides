He is nondifferent, in the representative sense, from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore the influence of time cannot affect him. The influence of time, which manifests as past, present and future, cannot touch higher personalities like Brahmä and other demigods. Sometimes demigods and great sages who have attained such perfection are called tri-käla jïa."
