There is a distinction in the manner a neophyte and an advanced devotee appreciate the Lord's presence in the temple. A neophyte considers the arcä-vigraha (the statue of the Lord) to be different from the original Personality of Godhead; he considers it a representation of the Supreme Lord in the form of a Deity. But an advanced devotee accepts the Deity in the temple as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He does not see any difference between the original form of the Lord and the statue, or arcä form of the Lord, in the temple. This is the vision of a devotee whose devotional service is in the highest stage of bhäva, or love of Godhead, whereas a neophyte's worship in the temple is a matter of routine duty."

            "content": "Temple Deity worship is one of the functions of a devotee. He goes regularly to see the Deity nicely decorated, and with veneration and respect he touches the lotus feet of the Lord and presents offerings of worship, such as fruits, flowers and prayers. At the same time, to advance in devotional service, a devotee should see other living entities as spiritual sparks, parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. A devotee is to offer respect to every entity that has a relationship with the Lord. Because every living entity originally has a relationship with the Lord as part and parcel, a devotee should try to see all living entities on the same equal level of spiritual existence. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, a paëòita, one who is learned, sees equally a very learned brähmaëa, a çüdra, a hog, a dog and a cow. He does not see the body, which is only an outward dress. He does not see the dress of a brähmaëa, or that of a cow or of a hog. He sees the spiritual spark, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. If a devotee does not see every living entity as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, he is considered präkåta-bhakta, a materialistic devotee. He is not completely situated on the spiritual platform; rather, he is in the lowest stage of devotion. He does, however, show all respect to the Deity."

Simply because a tiger is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord does not mean that we embrace him because of his spiritual relationship with the Supreme Lord. We must associate only with persons who have developed Kåñëa consciousness."

Other living entities are undoubtedly part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but because their consciousness is still covered and not developed in Kåñëa consciousness, we should renounce their association. It is said by Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura that even if one is a Vaiñëava, if he is not of good character his company should be avoided, although he may be offered the respect of a Vaiñëava. Anyone who accepts Viñëu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is accepted as a Vaiñëava, but a Vaiñëava is expected to develop all the good qualities of the demigods."

One should not give up the execution of devotional service because one or two attempts have not been successful. One must continue. Çré Rüpa Gosvämé also confirms that one should be very enthusiastic and execute devotional service with patience and confidence. Patience is necessary for developing the confidence that \"Kåñëa will certainly accept me because I am engaging in devotional service.\" One has only to execute service according to the rules and regulations to insure success."
