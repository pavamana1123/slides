Lord Viñëu is in charge of the mode of goodness, Lord Brahmä is in charge of the mode of passion, and Lord Çiva is in charge of the mode of ignorance. Similarly, there are many other demigods in charge of the air department, the water department, the cloud department, etc. Just as the government has many different departments, so, within this material world, the government of the Supreme Lord has many departments, and all these departments function in proper order out of fear of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Demigods are undoubtedly controlling all matter, animate and inanimate, within the universe, but above them the supreme controller is the Personality of Godhead. Therefore in the Brahma-saàhitä it is said, éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù (BS 5.1). Undoubtedly there are many controllers in the departmental management of this universe, but the supreme controller is Kåñëa."

As long as Brahmä does not die, creation, maintenance and destruction are actuated by different demigods under the superintendence of the Supreme Lord."
