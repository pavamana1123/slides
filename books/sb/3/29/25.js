There are prescribed duties for the different social classes of men—the brähmaëas, the vaiçyas, the kñatriyas and the çüdras—and for the different äçramas—brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. One should worship the Deity of the Lord until one appreciates the presence of the Lord in every living entity. In other words, one should not be satisfied simply by discharging his duties properly; he must realize his relationship and the relationship of all other living entities with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he does not understand this, then even though he discharges his prescribed duties properly, it is to be understood that he is simply laboring without profit."

            "content": "The word sva-karma-kåt in this verse is very significant. Sva-karma-kåt is one who engages in discharging his prescribed duties. It is not that one who has become a devotee of the Lord or who engages in devotional service should give up his prescribed duties. No one should be lazy under the plea of devotional service. One has to execute devotional service according to his prescribed duties. Sva-karma-kåt means that one should discharge the duties prescribed for him without neglect."
