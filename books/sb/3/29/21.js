If, therefore, one only engages in Deity worship in the temple and does not consider other living entities, then he is in the lowest grade of devotional service. One who worships the Deity in the temple and does not show respect to others is a devotee on the material platform, in the lowest stage of devotional service. A devotee should try to understand everything in relationship with Kåñëa and try to serve everything in that spirit. To serve everything means to engage everything in the service of Kåñëa. If a person is innocent and does not know his relationship with Kåñëa, an advanced devotee should try to engage him in the service of Kåñëa. One who is advanced in Kåñëa consciousness can engage not only the living being but everything in the service of Kåñëa."
