    "translation": "The pure devotee should execute devotional service by giving the greatest respect to the spiritual master and the äcäryas. He should be compassionate to the poor and make friendship with persons who are his equals, but all his activities should be executed under regulation and with control of the senses.",

Äcäryopäsanam: one should worship an äcärya, a spiritual master who knows things as they are. The spiritual master must be in the disciplic succession from Kåñëa. The predecessors of the spiritual master are his spiritual master, his grand spiritual master, his great-grand spiritual master and so on, who form the disciplic succession of äcäryas."

            "content": "It is recommended herewith that all the äcäryas be given the highest respect. It is stated, guruñu nara-matiù. Guruñu means \"unto the äcäryas,\" and nara-matiù means \"thinking like a common man.\" To think of the Vaiñëavas, the devotees, as belonging to a particular caste or community, to think of the äcäryas as ordinary men or to think of the Deity in the temple as being made of stone, wood or metal, is condemned. Niyamena: one should offer the greatest respect to the äcäryas according to the standard regulations. A devotee should also be compassionate to the poor. This does not refer to those who are poverty-stricken materially. According to devotional vision, a man is poor if he is not in Kåñëa consciousness. A man may be very rich materially, but if he is not Kåñëa conscious, he is considered poor. On the other hand, many äcäryas, such as Rüpa Gosvämé and Sanätana Gosvämé, used to live beneath trees every night. Superficially it appeared that they were poverty-stricken, but from their writings we can understand that in spiritual life they were the richest personalities."

That is one of the duties of a devotee. He should also make friendship with persons who are on an equal level with himself or who have the same understanding that he does. For a devotee, there is no point in making friendships with ordinary persons; he should make friendship with other devotees so that by discussing among themselves, they may elevate one another on the path of spiritual understanding. This is called iñöa-goñöhé."

There are innumerable books, such as the puräëas, Mahäbhärata, Bhägavatam, Bhagavad-gétä and Upaniñads, which contain countless subjects for discussion among two devotees or more. Friendship should be cemented between persons with mutual interests and understanding. Such persons are said to be sva jäti, \"of the same caste.\" The devotee should avoid a person whose character is not fixed in the standard understanding; even though he may be a Vaiñëava, or a devotee of Kåñëa, if his character is not correctly representative, then he should be avoided. One should steadily control the senses and the mind and strictly follow the rules and regulations, and he should make friendship with persons of the same standard."
