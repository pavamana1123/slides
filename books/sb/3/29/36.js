Since He is the origin of the Brahman effulgence and Paramätmä manifestation, He is described herewith as the chief personality. It is confirmed in the Kaöha Upaniñad, nityo nityänäm: there are many eternal living entities, but He is the chief maintainer. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä also, where Lord Kåñëa says, ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù:  such a person, after quitting his body, does not come back again to this material world, but goes to the Supreme Person. It is confirmed here, puruñaù puruñaà vrajet: the living entity goes to the Supreme Personality simply by understanding His transcendental nature and activities."
