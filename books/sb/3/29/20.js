            "content": "As a breeze carrying a pleasant fragrance from a garden of flowers at once captures the organ of smell, so one's consciousness, saturated with devotion, can at once capture the transcendental existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who, in His Paramätmä feature, is present everywhere, even in the heart of every living being. It is stated in Bhagavad-gétä that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is kñetra jïa, present within this body, but He is also simultaneously present in every other body. Since the individual soul is present only in a particular body, he is altered when another individual soul does not cooperate with him. The Supersoul, however, is equally present everywhere. Individual souls may disagree, but the Supersoul, being equally present in every body, is called unchanging, or avikäri. The individual soul, when fully saturated with Kåñëa consciousness, can understand the presence of the Supersoul. It is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä that (bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti ) a person saturated with devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, either as Supersoul or as the Supreme Person."
