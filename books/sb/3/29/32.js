Better than him is one who is liberated from all material contamination, and better than him is a pure devotee, who executes devotional service without expectation of reward.",

If someone not only has this knowledge but is able to clear all doubts if questioned about the Absolute Truth, he is considered better. Further, there may be a learned brähmaëa-Vaiñëava who can explain clearly and eradicate all doubts, but if he does not follow the Vaiñëava principles, then he is not situated on a higher level. One must be able to clear all doubts and simultaneously be situated in the brahminical characteristics. Such a person, who knows the purpose of the Vedic injunctions, who can employ the principles laid down in the Vedic literatures and who teaches his disciples in that way, is called an äcärya. The position of an äcärya is that he executes devotional service with no desire for elevation to a higher position of life."

A Vaiñëava who knows the science of the Absolute Truth but is not able to preach such knowledge to others is described as being in the lower stage, one who not only understands the principles of the science of God but can also preach is in the second stage, and one who not only can preach but who also sees everything in the Absolute Truth and the Absolute Truth in everything is in the highest class of Vaiñëavas. It is mentioned here that a Vaiñëava is already a brähmaëa; in fact, the highest stage of brahminical perfection is reached when one becomes a Vaiñëava."
