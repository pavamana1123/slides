This is foolishness. Suppose a person enters into a room; that does not mean that the room has become that person. Similarly, that the Supreme Lord has entered into each of the 8,400,000 particular types of material bodies does not mean that each of these bodies has become the Supreme Lord. Because the Supreme Lord is present, however, a pure devotee accepts each body as the temple of the Lord, and since the devotee offers respect to such temples in full knowledge, he gives respect to every living entity in relationship with the Lord. Mäyävädé philosophers wrongly think that because the Supreme Person has entered the body of a poor man, the Supreme Lord has become daridra-näräyaëa, or poor Näräyaëa. These are all blasphemous statements of atheists and nondevotees."
