Nature is working under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä, and we also find here that the sun shines under the direction of the Lord, and the cloud pours forth showers of rain under the direction of the Lord. All natural phenomena are under superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu."
