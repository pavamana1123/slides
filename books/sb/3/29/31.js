This system of brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras has now become vitiated as the present caste system in India, but it appears that this system has been current a very long time, since it is mentioned in Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä. Unless there is such a division of the social orders in human society, including the intelligent class, the martial class, the mercantile class and the laborer class, there is always confusion as to who is to work for what purpose. A person trained to the stage of understanding the Absolute Truth is a brähmaëa, and when such a brähmaëa is veda jïa, he understands the purpose of Veda. The purpose of Veda is to understand the Absolute. One who understands the Absolute Truth in three phases, namely Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän, and who understands the term Bhagavän to mean the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered to be the best of the brähmaëas, or a Vaiñëava."
