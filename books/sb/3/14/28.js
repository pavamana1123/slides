But those who are addicted to the decoration of the body, which is finally eatable by dogs, very luxuriously maintain it as the self. Such persons do not understand Lord Çiva, but they approach him for luxurious material comforts. There are two kinds of devotees of Lord Çiva. One class is the gross materialist seeking only bodily comforts from Lord Çiva, and the other class desires to become one with him. They are mostly impersonalists and prefer to chant çivo'ham, \"I am Çiva,\" or \"After liberation I shall become one with Lord Çiva.\" In other words, the karmés and jïänés are generally devotees of Lord Çiva, but they do not properly understand his real purpose in life. Sometimes so-called devotees of Lord Çiva imitate him in using poisonous intoxicants. Lord Çiva once swallowed an ocean of poison, and thus his throat became blue. The imitation Çivas try to follow him by indulging in poisons, and thus they are ruined. The real purpose of Lord Çiva is to serve the Soul of the soul, Lord Kåñëa. He desires that all luxurious articles, such as nice garments, garlands, ornaments and cosmetics, be given to Lord Kåñëa only, because Kåñëa is the real enjoyer. He refuses to accept such luxurious items himself because they are only meant for Kåñëa. However, since they do not know this purpose of Lord Çiva, foolish persons either laugh at him or profitlessly try to imitate him."
