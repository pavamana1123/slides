Kaçyapa Muni meditated on the impersonal brahmajyoti by chanting the Gäyatré mantra within his mouth. When a Vedic mantra is chanted within the mouth so that only the chanter can hear, the chanting is called japa. But when such mantras are chanted loudly, it is called kértana. The Vedic hymn Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare can be chanted both softly to oneself or loudly; therefore it is called the mahä-mantra, or the great hymn."

            "content": "Kaçyapa Muni appears to be an impersonalist. Comparing his character with that of Öhäkura Haridäsa as referred to above, it is clear that the personalist is stronger in sense control than the impersonalist. This is explained in Bhagavad-gétä as paraà dåñövä nivartate;  i.e., one ceases to accept lower grade things when one is situated in a superior condition. One is supposed to be purified after taking bath and chanting Gäyatré, but the mahä-mantra is so powerful that one can chant loudly or softly, in any condition, and he is protected from all the evils of material existence."
