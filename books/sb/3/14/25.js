            "content": "Lord Çiva is not an ordinary living entity, nor is he in the category of Viñëu, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is far more powerful than any living entity up to the standard of Brahmä, yet he is not on an equal level with Viñëu. Since he is almost like Lord Viñëu, Çiva can see past, present and future. One of his eyes is like the sun, another is like the moon, and his third eye, which is between his eyebrows, is like fire. He can generate fire from his middle eye, and he is able to vanquish any powerful living entity, including Brahmä, yet he does not live pompously in a nice house, etc., nor does he possess any material properties, although he is master of the material world. He lives mostly in the crematorium, where dead bodies are burnt, and the whirlwind dust of the crematorium is his bodily dress. He is unstained by material contamination. Kaçyapa took him as his younger brother because the youngest sister of Diti (Kaçyapa's wife) was married to Lord Çiva. The husband of one's sister is considered one's brother. By that social relationship, Lord Çiva happened to be the younger brother of Kaçyapa. Kaçyapa warned his wife that because Lord Çiva would see their sex indulgence, the time was not appropriate. Diti might argue that they would enjoy sex life in a private place, but Kaçyapa reminded her that Lord Çiva has three eyes, called the sun, moon and fire, and one cannot escape his vigilance any more than one can escape Viñëu. Although seen by the police, a criminal is sometimes not immediately punished; the police wait for the proper time to apprehend him. The forbidden time for sexual intercourse would be noted by Lord Çiva, and Diti would meet with proper punishment by giving birth to a child of ghostly character or a godless impersonalist. Kaçyapa foresaw this, and thus he warned his wife Diti."
