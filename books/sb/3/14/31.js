He knew that the child born of such untimely sexual intercourse would certainly not be a good child, but could not protect himself because he was too obligated to his wife. In a similar case, however, when Öhäkura Haridäsa was tempted by a public prostitute at the dead of night, he avoided the allurement because of his perfection in Kåñëa consciousness. That is the difference between a Kåñëa conscious person and others. Kaçyapa Muni was greatly learned and enlightened, and he knew all the rules and regulations of systematic life, yet he failed to protect himself from the attack of sex desire. Öhäkura Haridäsa was not born of a brähmaëa family, nor was he himself brähmaëa, yet he could protect himself from such an attack due to his being Kåñëa conscious. Öhäkura Haridäsa used to chant the holy name of the Lord three hundred thousand times daily."
