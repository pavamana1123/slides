He is very prone to anger as well as quickly pacified. Diti knew that because of his being quickly angered he might spoil the pregnancy she had so unlawfully achieved. But because he was also Äçutoña, she implored her brähmaëa husband to help her in pacifying Lord Çiva, for her husband was a great devotee of Lord Çiva. In other words, Lord Çiva might have been angry with Diti because she obliged her husband to transgress the law, but he would not refuse her husband's prayer. Therefore the application for excuse was submitted through her husband. She prayed to Lord Çiva as follows."
