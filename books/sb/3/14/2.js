In both millenniums there was a boar incarnation of the Lord, but in the Sväyambhuva millennium He lifted the earth from within the water of the universe, whereas in the Cäkñuña millennium He killed the first demon, Hiraëyäkña. In the Sväyambhuva millennium He assumed the color white, and in the Cäkñuña millennium He assumed the color red. Vidura had already heard about one of them, and he proposed to hear about the other. The two different boar incarnations described are the one Supreme Personality of Godhead."
