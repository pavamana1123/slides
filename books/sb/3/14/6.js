He left this world at an early age, as a young boy, although he had attained the throne of his father and had several children of his own. Because he was due to quit this world, death was waiting for him. He did not care for death, however, and even with his present body he boarded a spiritual airplane and went directly to the planet of Viñëu because of his association with the great sage Närada, who had spoken to him the narration of the pastimes of the Lord."
