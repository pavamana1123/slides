He is called Mahädeva, or the greatest of all demigods, and no one is equal to or greater than him in the material world. He is almost equal with Lord Viñëu. Although he always associates with Mäyä, Durgä, he is above the reactionary stage of the three modes of material nature, and although he is in charge of devilish characters in the mode of ignorance, he is not affected by such association."
