            "content": "Lord Çiva, or Rudra, is the king of the ghosts. Ghostly characters worship Lord Çiva to be gradually guided toward a path of self-realization. Mäyävädé philosophers are mostly worshipers of Lord Çiva, and Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya is considered to be the incarnation of Lord Çiva for preaching godlessness to the Mäyävädé philosophers. Ghosts are bereft of a physical body because of their grievously sinful acts, such as suicide. The last resort of the ghostly characters in human society is to take shelter of suicide, either material or spiritual. Material suicide causes loss of the physical body, and spiritual suicide causes loss of the individual identity. Mäyävädé philosophers desire to lose their individuality and merge into the impersonal spiritual brahmajyoti existence. Lord Çiva, being very kind to the ghosts, sees that although they are condemned, they get physical bodies. He places them into the wombs of women who indulge in sexual intercourse regardless of the restrictions on time and circumstance. Kaçyapa wanted to impress this fact upon Diti so that she might wait for a while."
