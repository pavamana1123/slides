            "content": "There are three stages of transcendental development in devotional service, which are technically called sthäyi-bhäva, anubhäva and mahäbhäva. Continual perfect love of Godhead is called sthäyi-bhäva, and when it is performed in a particular type of transcendental relationship it is called anubhäva. But the stage of mahäbhäva is visible amongst the personal pleasure potential energies of the Lord. It is understood that the grandson of Diti, namely Prahläda Mahäräja, would constantly meditate on the Lord and reiterate His activities. Because he would constantly remain in meditation, he would easily transfer himself to the spiritual world after quitting his material body. Such meditation is still more conveniently performed by chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord. This is especially recommended in this age of Kali."
