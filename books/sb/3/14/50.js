This direct vision is possible only for one who is highly elevated in Kåñëa consciousness, for the Lord is not possible to see with material eyes. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has multifarious eternal forms such as Kåñëa, Baladeva, Saìkarñaëa, Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Väsudeva, Näräyaëa, Räma, Nåsiàha, Varäha and Vämana, and the devotee of the Lord knows all those Viñëu forms. A pure devotee becomes attached to one of the eternal forms of the Lord, and the Lord is pleased to appear before him in the form desired. A devotee does not imagine something whimsical about the form of the Lord, nor does he ever think that the Lord is impersonal and can assume a form desired by the nondevotee. The nondevotee has no idea of the form of the Lord, and thus he cannot think of any one of the above-mentioned forms. But whenever a devotee sees the Lord, he sees Him in a most beautifully decorated form, accompanied by His constant companion the goddess of fortune, who is eternally beautiful."
