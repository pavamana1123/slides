However, one who surrenders unto Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can conquer this seemingly insurmountable spell of mäyä. Here also it is stated that the daivé prakåti, or the external energy of the Supreme Lord, is durvibhävyä, very difficult to understand and very difficult to conquer. One must, however, conquer this insurmountable spell of mäyä, and this is possible, by the grace of the Lord, when God reveals Himself to the surrendered soul. It is also stated here, svarüpeëävatiñöhate. Svarüpa means that one has to know that he is not the Supreme Soul, but rather, part and parcel of the Supreme Soul; that is self-realization. To think falsely that one is the Supreme Soul and that one is all-pervading is not svarüpa. This is not realization of his actual position. The real position is that one is part and parcel. It is recommended here that one remain in that position of actual self-realization. In Bhagavad-gétä this understanding is defined as Brahman realization."

            "content": "After Brahman realization, one can engage in the activities of Brahman. As long as one is not self-realized, he engages in activities based on false identification with the body. When one is situated in his real self, then the activities of Brahman realization begin. The Mäyävädé philosophers say that after Brahman realization, all activities stop, but that is not actually so. If the soul is so active in its abnormal condition, existing under the covering of matter, how can one deny its activity when free? An example may be cited here. If a man in a diseased condition is very active, how can one imagine that when he is free from the disease he will be inactive? Naturally the conclusion is that when one is free from all disease his activities are pure. It may be said that the activities of Brahman realization are different from those of conditional life, but that does not stop activity. This is indicated in Bhagavad-gétä  after Brahman realization, one can engage in the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore devotional service of the Lord is activity in Brahman realization."
