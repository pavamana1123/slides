Religious practices should be executed only to gain freedom from the clutches of material nature. It is stated in the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam that the topmost religious practice is that by which one can attain to the transcendental devotional service of the Lord, without reason or cause. Such religious practice is never hampered by any impediments, and by its performance one actually becomes satisfied. Here this is recommended as mokña-dharma, religious practice for salvation, or transcendence of the clutches of material contamination. Generally people execute religious practices for economic development or sense gratification, but that is not recommended for one who wants to advance in yoga."

            "content": "The next important phrase is mita-medhyädanam, which means that one should eat very frugally. It is recommended in the Vedic literatures that a yogé eat only half what he desires according to his hunger. If one is so hungry that he could devour one pound of foodstuffs, then instead of eating one pound, he should consume only half a pound and supplement this with four ounces of water; one fourth of the stomach should be left empty for passage of air in the stomach. If one eats in this manner, he will avoid indigestion and disease. The yogé should eat in this way, as recommended in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam and all other standard scriptures. The yogé should live in a secluded place, where his yoga practice will not be disturbed."
