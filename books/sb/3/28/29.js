Whenever there is a discrepancy in the discharge of religious principles and there is prominence of irreligion, the Lord descends for the protection of the devotees and the destruction of the nondevotees. When He appears, His main purpose is to give solace to His devotees. He does not have to come Himself to destroy the demons, for He has many agents; even the external energy, mäyä, has sufficient strength to kill them. But when He comes to show compassion to His devotees, He kills the nondevotees as a matter of course."

            "content": "The Lord appears in the particular form loved by a particular type of devotee. There are millions of forms of the Lord, but they are one Absolute. As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä, advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam: (BS 5.33) all the different forms of the Lord are one, but some devotees want to see Him in the form of Rädhä and Kåñëa, others prefer Him as Sétä and Rämacandra, others would see Him as Lakñmé-Näräyaëa, and others want to see Him as four-handed Näräyaëa, Väsudeva. The Lord has innumerable forms, and He appears in a particular form as preferred by a particular type of devotee. A yogé is advised to meditate upon the forms that are approved by devotees. A yogé cannot imagine a form for meditation. Those so-called yogés who manufacture a circle or target are engaged in nonsense. Actually, a yogé must meditate upon the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that has been experienced by the Lord's pure devotees. Yogé means devotee. Yogés who are not actually pure devotees should follow in the footsteps of devotees. It is especially mentioned here that the yogé should meditate upon the form which is thus approved; he cannot manufacture a form of the Lord."
