    "translation": "One should practice nonviolence and truthfulness, should avoid thieving and be satisfied with possessing as much as he needs for his maintenance. He should abstain from sex life, perform austerity, be clean, study the Vedas and worship the supreme form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

In Bhagavad-gétä it is confirmed by Arjuna that Kåñëa is the original puruña, or Personality of Godhead, puruñaà çäçvatam. Therefore in yoga practice one not only must concentrate his mind on the person of Kåñëa, but must also worship the form or Deity of Kåñëa daily."

            "content": "A brahmacäré practices celibacy, controlling his sex life. One cannot enjoy unrestricted sex life and practice yoga; this is rascaldom. So-called yogés advertise that one can go on enjoying as one likes and simultaneously become a yogé, but this is totally unauthorized. It is very clearly explained here that one must observe celibacy. Brahmacaryam means that one leads his life simply in relationship with Brahman, or in full Kåñëa consciousness. Those who are too addicted to sex life cannot observe the regulations which will lead them to Kåñëa consciousness. Sex life should be restricted to persons who are married. A person whose sex life is restricted in marriage is also called a brahmacäré."

            "content": "The word asteyam is also very important for a yogé. Asteyam means \"to refrain from theft.\" In the broader sense, everyone who accumulates more than he needs is a thief. According to spiritual communism, one cannot possess more than he needs for his personal maintenance. That is the law of nature. Anyone who accumulates more money or more possessions than he needs is called a thief, and one who simply accumulates wealth without spending for sacrifice or for worship of the Personality of Godhead is a great thief."

            "content": "Svädhyäyaù means \"reading the authorized Vedic scriptures.\" Even if one is not Kåñëa conscious and is practicing the yoga system, he must read standard Vedic literatures in order to understand. Performance of yoga alone is not sufficient. Narottama däsa Öhäkura, a great devotee and äcärya in the Gauòéya Vaiñëava-sampradäya, says that all spiritual activities should be understood from three sources, namely saintly persons, standard scriptures and the spiritual master. These three guides are very important for progress in spiritual life. The spiritual master prescribes standard literature for the prosecution of the yoga of devotional service, and he himself speaks only from scriptural reference. Therefore reading standard scriptures is necessary for executing yoga. Practicing yoga without reading the standard literatures is simply a waste of time."
