    "translation": "With devotion steeped in love and affection, the yogé should meditate within the core of his heart upon the laughter of Lord Viñëu. The laughter of Viñëu is so captivating that it can be easily meditated upon. When the Supreme Lord is laughing, one can see His small teeth, which resemble jasmine buds rendered rosy by the splendor of His lips. Once devoting his mind to this, the yogé should no longer desire to see anything else.",

These particular descriptions of meditation on the smile, laughter, face, lips and teeth all indicate conclusively that God is not impersonal. It is described herein that one should meditate on the laughter or smiling of Viñëu. There is no other activity that can completely cleanse the heart of the devotee. The exceptional beauty of the laughter of Lord Viñëu is that when He smiles His small teeth, which resemble the buds of jasmine flowers, at once become reddish, reflecting His rosy lips. If the yogé is able to place the beautiful face of the Lord in the core of his heart, he will be completely satisfied. In other words, when one is absorbed in seeing the beauty of the Lord within himself, the material attraction can no longer disturb him."
