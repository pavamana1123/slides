Bhagavataù refers to Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Godhead is Kåñëa; from Him comes the first expansion, Baladeva, and from Baladeva come Saìkarñaëa, Aniruddha and many other forms, followed by the puruña-avatäras. As mentioned in the previous verses (puruñärcanam), this puruña is represented as the Paramätmä, or Supersoul. A description of the Supersoul, upon whom one must meditate, will be given in the following verses. In this verse it is clearly stated that one must meditate by fixing the vision on the tip of the nose and concentrating one's mind on the kalä, or the plenary expansion, of Viñëu."
