    "synonyms": "jänu-dvayam—up to the knees; jalaja-locanayä—lotus-eyed; jananyä—mother; lakñmyä—by Lakñmé; akhilasya—of the entire universe; sura-vanditayä—worshiped by the demigods; vidhätuù—of Brahmä; ürvoù—at the thighs; nidhäya—having placed; kara-pallava-rociñä—with her lustrous fingers; yat—which; saàlälitam—massaged; hådi—in the heart; vibhoù—of the Lord; abhavasya—transcendental to material existence; kuryät—one should meditate.",
    "translation": "The yogé should fix in his heart the activities of Lakñmé, the goddess of fortune, who is worshiped by all demigods and is the mother of the supreme person, Brahmä. She can always be found massaging the legs and thighs of the transcendental Lord, very carefully serving Him in this way.",

            "content": "Brahmä is the appointed lord of the universe. Because his father is Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, Lakñmé, the goddess of fortune, is automatically his mother. Lakñméjé is worshiped by all demigods and by the inhabitants of other planets as well. Human beings are also eager to receive favor from the goddess of fortune. Lakñmé is always engaged in massaging the legs and thighs of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Näräyaëa, who is lying on the ocean of Garbha within the universe. Brahmä is described here as the son of the goddess of fortune, but actually he was not born of her womb. Brahmä takes his birth from the abdomen of the Lord Himself. A lotus flower grows from the abdomen of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, and Brahmä is born there. Therefore Lakñméjé's massaging of the thighs of the Lord should not be taken as the behavior of an ordinary wife. The Lord is transcendental to the behavior of the ordinary male and female. The word abhavasya is very significant, for it indicates that He could produce Brahmä without the assistance of the goddess of fortune."

            "content": "Since transcendental behavior is different from mundane behavior, it should not be taken that the Lord receives service from His wife just as a demigod or human being might receive service from his wife. It is advised here that the yogé always keep this picture in his heart. The devotee always thinks of this relationship between Lakñmé and Näräyaëa; therefore he does not meditate on the mental plane as impersonalists and voidists do."

            "content": "Bhava means \"one who accepts a material body,\" and abhava means \"one who does not accept a material body but descends in the original, spiritual body.\" Lord Näräyaëa is not born of anything material. Matter is generated from matter, but He is not born of matter. Brahmä is born after the creation, but since the Lord existed before the creation, the Lord has no material body."
