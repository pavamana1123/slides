The general yoga process entails observing the rules and regulations, practicing the different sitting postures, concentrating the mind on the vital circulation of the air and then thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Vaikuëöha pastimes. This is the general process of yoga. This same concentration can be achieved by other recommended processes, and therefore anyaiç ca, other methods, also can be applied. The essential point is that the mind, which is contaminated by material attraction, has to be bridled and concentrated on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It cannot be fixed on something void or impersonal. For this reason, so-called yoga practices of voidism and impersonalism are not recommended in any standard yoga-çästra. The real yogé is the devotee because his mind is always concentrated on the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa. Therefore Kåñëa consciousness is the topmost yoga system."
