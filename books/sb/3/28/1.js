To begin, the Lord says that by yoga practice one can make progress towards understanding the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the previous chapter it has been clearly stated that the desired result of yoga is not to achieve some wonderful mystic power. One should not be at all attracted by such mystic power, but should attain progressive realization on the path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä, which states in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter that the greatest yogé is he who constantly thinks of Kåñëa within himself, or he who is Kåñëa conscious."

            "content": "It is stated here that by following the system of yoga one can become joyful. Lord Kapila, the Personality of Godhead, who is the highest authority on yoga, here explains the yoga system known as añöäìga-yoga, which comprises eight different practices, namely yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna and samädhi. By all these stages of practice one must realize Lord Viñëu, who is the target of all yoga. There are so-called yoga practices in which one concentrates the mind on voidness or on the impersonal, but this is not approved by the authorized yoga system as explained by Kapiladeva. Even Pataïjali explains that the target of all yoga is Viñëu. Añöäìga-yoga is therefore part of Vaiñëava practice because its ultimate goal is realization of Viñëu. The achievement of success in yoga is not acquisition of mystic power, which is condemned in the previous chapter, but, rather, freedom from all material designations and situation in one's constitutional position. That is the ultimate achievement in yoga practice."
