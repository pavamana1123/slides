He says further, paraà vijayate: \"All glories to Çré Kåñëa saìkértana!\" All glories are given to the chanting of the holy names of Kåñëa because as soon as one begins this process of chanting, the mind becomes purified. Ceto-darpaëa-märjanam:  by chanting the holy name of Kåñëa one is cleansed of the dirt that accumulates in the mind. One can purify the mind either by the breathing process or by the chanting process, just as one can purify gold by putting it in a fire and fanning it with a bellows."
