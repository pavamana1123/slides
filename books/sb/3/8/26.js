            "content": "The Lord fulfills the desires of everyone just as one desires. Pure devotees are interested in achieving the transcendental service of the Lord, which is nondifferent from Him. Therefore, the Lord is the only desire of the pure devotees, and devotional service is the only spotless process for achieving His favor. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé says in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.1.11) that pure devotional service is jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam:  pure devotional service is without any tinge of speculative knowledge and fruitive activities. Such devotional service is able to award the pure devotee the highest result, namely direct association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa. According to the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad, the Lord showed one of the many thousands of petals of His lotus feet. It is said: brähmaëo'säv anavarataà me dhyätaù stutaù parärdhänte so 'budhyata gopa-veço me purastät ävirbabhüva. After meditating for millions of years, Lord Brahmä could understand the transcendental form of the Lord as Çré Kåñëa, in the dress of a cowherd boy, and thus he recorded his experience in the Brahma-saàhitä in the famous prayer, govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi."
