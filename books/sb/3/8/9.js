            "content": "The great sage of the name Pulastya is the father of all demoniac descendants. Once upon a time Paräçara began a sacrifice in which all the demons were to be burnt to death because his father had been killed and devoured by one of them. The great sage Vasiñöha Muni arrived at the sacrifice and requested Paräçara to stop the deadly action, and because of Vasiñöha's position and respect in the community of sages, Paräçara could not deny the request. Paräçara having stopped the sacrifice, Pulastya, the father of the demons, appreciated his brahminical temperament and gave the blessing that in the future he would be a great speaker on the Vedic literatures called the Puräëas, the supplements of the Vedas. Paräçara's action was appreciated by Pulastya because Paräçara had forgiven the demons out of his brahminical power of forgiveness. Paräçara was able to demolish all the demons in the sacrifice, but he considered, \"Demons are so made that they devour living creatures, men and animals, but why on that account should I withdraw my brahminical qualification of forgiveness?\" As the great speaker of the Puräëas, Paräçara first of all spoke on the Çrémad-Bhägavata Puräëa because it is the foremost of all the Puräëas. Maitreya Muni desired to narrate the same Bhägavatam be had heard from Paräçara, and Vidura was qualified to hear it because of his faithfulness and his following the instructions received from superiors. So Çrémad-Bhägavatam was being narrated from time immemorial by the disciplic succession, even before the time of Vyäsadeva. The so-called historians calculate the Puräëas to be only a few hundred years old, but factually the Puräëas existed from time immemorial, before all historical calculations by the mundaners and speculative philosophers."
