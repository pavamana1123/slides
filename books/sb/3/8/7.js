    "translation": "Lord Saìkarñaëa thus spoke the purport of Çrémad-Bhägavatam to the great sage Sanat-kumära, who had already taken the vow of renunciation. Sanat-kumära also, in his turn, when inquired of by Säìkhyäyana Muni, explained Çrémad-Bhägavatam as he had heard it from Saìkarñaëa.",

            "content": "This is the way of the paramparä system. Although Sanat-kumära, the well-known great saintly Kumära, was in the perfect stage of life, still he heard the message of Çrémad-Bhägavatam from Lord Saìkarñaëa. Similarly, when he was questioned by Säìkhyäyana Åñi, he spoke to him the same message he had heard from Lord Saìkarñaëa. In other words, unless one hears from the proper authority one cannot become a preacher. In devotional service, therefore, two items out of the nine, namely hearing and chanting, are most important. Without hearing nicely, one cannot preach the message of Vedic knowledge."
