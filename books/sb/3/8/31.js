    "translation": "Lord Brahmä, thus looking upon the Lord in the shape of a mountain, concluded that He was Hari, the Personality of Godhead. He saw that the garland of flowers on His chest glorified Him with Vedic wisdom in sweet songs and looked very beautiful. He was protected by the Sudarçana wheel for fighting, and even the sun, moon, air, fire, etc., could not have access to Him.",
