The age of Brahmä is calculated in terms of divya years, which are distinct from the solar years of human beings. The divya years are calculated in Bhagavad-gétä : sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaëo viduù. Brahmä's one day is equal to one thousand times the aggregate of the four yugas (calculated to be 4,300,000 years). On that basis, Brahmä meditated for one hundred years before he could understand the supreme cause of all causes, and then he wrote the Brahma-saàhitä, which is approved and recognized by Lord Caitanya and in which he sings, govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi. One has to wait for the mercy of the Lord before one can either render service unto Him or know Him as He is."
