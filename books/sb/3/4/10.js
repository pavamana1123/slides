            "content": "Although both Uddhava and Maitreya were great souls, the Lord's attention was more on Uddhava because he was a spotlessly pure devotee. A jïäna-bhakta, or one whose devotion is mixed with the monistic viewpoint, is not a pure devotee. Although Maitreya was a devotee, his devotion was mixed. The Lord reciprocates with His devotees on the basis of transcendental love and not on the basis of philosophical knowledge or fruitive activities. In the transcendental loving service of the Lord, there is no place for monistic knowledge or fruitive activities. The gopés in Våndävana were neither highly learned scholars nor mystic yogés. They had spontaneous love for the Lord, and thus He became their heart and soul, and the gopés also became the heart and soul of the Lord. Lord Caitanya approved the relationship of the gopés with the Lord as supreme. Herein the Lord's attitude towards Uddhava was more intimate than with Maitreya Muni."
