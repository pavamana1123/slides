Çréla Vyäsadeva has definitely forbidden persons engaged in religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, finally, salvation, from trying to understand Çrémad-Bhägavatam, which is not meant for them  directly from the Lord, who spoke them first to Brahmäjé, and this time the Lord explained more confidentially the self-knowledge mentioned as the paramäà sthitim. Upon learning such self-knowledge of love, Uddhava felt very much aggrieved by feelings of separation from the Lord. Unless one is awakened to the stage of Uddhava—everlastingly feeling the separation of the Lord in transcendental love, as exhibited by Lord Caitanya also—one cannot understand the real import of the four essential verses of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. One should not indulge in the unauthorized act of twisting the meaning and thereby putting himself on the dangerous path of offense."
