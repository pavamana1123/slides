            "content": "The subject matter of the appearance and disappearance of the Supersoul, Lord Çré Kåñëa, is a mystery even for the great sages. The word paramätmanaù is significant in this verse. An ordinary living being is generally called the ätmä, but Lord Kåñëa is never an ordinary living being because He is paramätmä, the Supersoul. Yet His appearance as one of the human beings and His disappearance again from the mortal world are subject matters for the research workers who execute research work with great perseverance. Such subject matters are certainly of increasing interest because the researchers have to search out the transcendental abode of the Lord, which He enters after finishing His pastimes in the mortal world. But even the great sages have no information that beyond the material sky is the spiritual sky where Çré Kåñëa eternally resides with His associates, although at the same time He exhibits His pastimes in the mortal world in all the universes one after another. This fact is confirmed in Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38): goloka eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù. \"The Lord, by His inconceivable potency, resides in His eternal abode, Goloka, yet at the same time, as the Supersoul, He is present everywhere—in both the spiritual and material skies—by His multivarieties of manifestation.\" Therefore His appearance and disappearance are simultaneously going on, and no one can say definitely which of them is the beginning and which is the end. His eternal pastimes have no beginning or end, and one has to learn of them from the pure devotee only and not waste valuable time in so-called research work."
