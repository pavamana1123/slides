The Lord said that the concise form of Çrémad-Bhägavatam as explained to Brahmä was meant to elucidate His personality. The impersonal explanation of those four verses in the Second Canto is nullified herewith. Çrédhara Svämé also explains in this connection that the same concise form of the Bhägavatam concerned the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa and was never meant for impersonal indulgence."
