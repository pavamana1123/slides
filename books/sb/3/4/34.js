The Lord never reveals Himself to persons like the jïänés and yogés. And there are others who, because of their envying the Lord from the bottom of their hearts, are classified amongst the beasts, and for such envious beasts the subject matter of the Lord's appearance and disappearance is simply a mental disturbance. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä , the miscreants who are simply concerned with material enjoyment, who work very hard like beasts of burden, can hardly know the Personality of Godhead at any stage due to äsurika-bhäva, or a spirit of revolt against the Supreme Lord."

The more they discuss the transcendental appearance and disappearance of the Lord in the asuric spirit, the more they enter into the darkest region of hell, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä . Anyone who is against the transcendental loving service of the Lord is more or less a beastly creature, as confirmed in this verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam."
