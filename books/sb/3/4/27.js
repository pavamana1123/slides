    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: O King, after thus discussing with Vidura the transcendental name, fame, qualities, etc., on the bank of the Yamunä, Uddhava was overwhelmed with great affliction. He passed the night as if it were a moment, and thereafter he went away.",

Both Uddhava and Vidura were in great affliction because of Lord Kåñëa's departure, and the more they discussed the transcendental name, fame and qualities of the Lord, the more the picture of the Lord became visible to them everywhere. Such visualization of the transcendental form of the Lord is neither false nor imaginary but is factual Absolute Truth. When the Lord is perceived as viçva-mürti, it is not that He loses His personality or transcendental eternal form, but He becomes visible in the same form everywhere."
