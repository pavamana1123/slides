By drinking they all became delirious, and, bereft of knowledge, they touched the cores of each other's hearts with harsh words.",

So the descendants of Våñëi and Bhoja formally took permission from the brähmaëas and ate the prepared foodstuff. Kñatriyas are permitted to drink at certain occasions, so they all drank a kind of light liquor made of rice. By such drinking they became delirious and bereft of sense, so much so that they forgot their relationship with one another and used harsh words which touched the cores of each other's hearts. Drinking is so harmful that even such a highly cultured family becomes affected by intoxication and can forget themselves in a drunken state. The descendants of Våñëi and Bhoja were not expected to forget themselves in this way, but by the will of the Supreme it happened, and thus they became harsh towards one another."
