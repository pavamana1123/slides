            "content": "The words paramäà sthitim are significant in this verse. The Lord's transcendental situation was not even spoken of to Brahmä when the four verses of Çrémad-Bhägavatam  were explained. This transcendental situation comprises His dealings with devotees engaged in transcendental loving service, as exhibited at Dvärakä and Våndävana. When the Lord explained His specific transcendental situation, it was meant for Uddhava only, and therefore Uddhava particularly said mahyam (\"unto me\"), although the great sage Maitreya was also sitting there. Such a transcendental situation is hardly understood by those whose devotion is mixed with speculative knowledge or fruitive activities. The Lord's activities in confidential love are very rarely disclosed to the general devotees who are attracted by devotion mixed with knowledge and mysticism. Such activities are the inconceivable pastimes of the Lord."
