Therefore it is to be understood that all 8,400,000 species of bodily forms originate from the Lord, who is always ädi, or the beginning. In Bhagavad-gétä Arjuna addresses the Lord as ädyam, or the original. Similarly, in the Brahma-saàhitä the Lord is addressed as ädi-puruñam, the original person. Indeed, in Bhagavad-gétä  the Lord Himself declares, mattaù sarvaà pravartate: \"From Me everything proceeds.\""

In the material world a boar or pig is considered most abominable, but the ädi-sükara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was not treated as an ordinary boar. Even Lord Brahmä and the other demigods praised the Lord's form as a boar."

By killing the demon Hiraëyäkña He fulfilled His promise to kill the demons and always protect the demigods headed by Brahmä. The statement that the Lord returned to His own abode indicates that He has His own particular transcendental residence. Since He is full of all energies, He is all-pervasive in spite of His residing in Goloka Våndävana, just as the sun, although situated in a particular place within the universe, is present by its sunshine throughout the universe."

The impersonalists accept one aspect of the Lord's features, the all-pervasive aspect, but they cannot understand His localized situation in His transcendental abode, where He always engages in fully transcendental pastimes. Especially mentioned in this verse is the word akhaëòitotsavam. Utsava means \"pleasure.\" Whenever some function takes place to express happiness, it is called utsava. Utsava, the expression of complete happiness, is always present in the Vaikuëöhalokas, the abode of the Lord, who is worshipable even by demigods like Brahmä, to say nothing of other, less important entities such as human beings."

The Lord's abode is situated far above this material sky, and He descends from that higher position; thus He is called avatära."
