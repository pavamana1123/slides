            "content": "Even famous yogés and demons can sometimes enact very magical feats by their mystic power, but in the presence of the Sudarçana cakra, when it is let loose by the Lord, all such magical jugglery is dispersed. The instance of the quarrel between Durväsä Muni and Mahäräja Ambaréña is a practical example in this matter. Durväsä Muni wanted to display many magical wonders, but when the Sudarçana cakra appeared, Durväsä himself was afraid and fled to various planets for his personal protection. The Lord is described here as tri-pät, which means that He is the enjoyer of three kinds of sacrifices. In Bhagavad-gétä the Lord confirms that He is the beneficiary and enjoyer of all sacrifices, penances and austerities. The Lord is the enjoyer of three kinds of yajïa. As further described in Bhagavad-gétä, there are sacrifices of goods, sacrifices of meditation and sacrifices of philosophical speculation. Those on the paths of jïäna, yoga and karma all have to come in the end to the Supreme Lord because väsudevaù sarvam iti —the Supreme Lord is the ultimate enjoyer of everything. That is the perfection of all sacrifice."
