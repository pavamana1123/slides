For example, there are pastimes of Lord Kåñëa and narrations of devotees like Prahläda, Dhruva and Mahäräja Ambaréña. Both pastimes pertain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because the devotees' pastimes are in relation with Him. The Mahäbhärata, for example, the history of the Päëòavas and their activities, is sacred because the Päëòavas had a direct relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
