This has been narrated by me as I heard it from my predecessor spiritual master.",

Thus he accepted as bona fide the system of paramparä, or receiving the transcendental message in disciplic succession. Unless received by this bona fide process of hearing from a spiritual master, the statement of an äcärya or preceptor cannot be valid."

            "content": "It is also stated here that although the demon Hiraëyäkña was unlimited in prowess, he was just like a doll for the Lord. A child breaks so many dolls without real endeavor. Similarly, although a demon may be very powerful and extraordinary in the eyes of an ordinary man in the material world, to the Lord, killing such a demon is no difficulty. He can kill millions of demons as simply as a child plays with dolls and breaks them."
