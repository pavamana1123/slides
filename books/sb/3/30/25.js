The first description is that the criminal has to eat his own flesh, burning with fire, or allow others like himself who are present there to eat. In the last great war, people in concentration camps sometimes ate their own stool, so there is no wonder that in the Yamasädana, the abode of Yamaräja, one who had a very enjoyable life eating others' flesh has to eat his own flesh."
