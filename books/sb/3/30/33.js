            "content": "Three words in this verse are very significant. Kevalena means \"only by black methods,\" adharmeëa means \"unrighteous\" or \"irreligious,\" and kuöumba-bharaëa means \"family maintenance.\" Maintaining one's family is certainly the duty of a householder, but one should be eager to earn his livelihood by the prescribed method, as stated in the scriptures. In Bhagavad-gétä it is described that the Lord has divided the social system into four classifications of castes, or varëas, according to quality and work. Apart from Bhagavad-gétä, in every society a man is known according to his quality and work. For example, when a man is constructing wooden furniture, he is called a carpenter, and a man who works with an anvil and iron is called a blacksmith. Similarly, a man who is engaged in the medical or engineering fields has a particular duty and designation. All these human activities have been divided by the Supreme Lord into four varëas, namely brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra. In Bhagavad-gétä and in other Vedic literatures, the specific duties of the brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra are mentioned."

            "content": "One should work honestly according to his qualification. He should not earn his livelihood unfairly, by means for which he is not qualified. If a brähmaëa who works as a priest so that he may enlighten his followers with the spiritual way of life is not qualified as a priest, then he is cheating the public. One should not earn by such unfair means. The same is applicable to a kñatriya or to a vaiçya. It is especially mentioned that the means of livelihood of those who are trying to advance in Kåñëa consciousness must be very fair and uncomplicated. Here it is mentioned that he who earns his livelihood by unfair means (kevalena) is sent to the darkest hellish region. Otherwise, if one maintains his family by prescribed methods and honest means, there is no objection to one's being a family man."
