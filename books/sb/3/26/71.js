The relationship between the viräö-puruña and the presiding deities or the living entities is so intricate that simply by exercising the sense organs, which are related to their presiding deities, the viräö-puruña cannot be aroused. It is not possible to arouse the viräö-puruña or to link with the Supreme Absolute Personality of Godhead by material activities. Only by devotional service and detachment can one perform the process of linking with the Absolute."
