Without digestion there is no hunger and thirst or power to eat and drink. When there is insufficient hunger and thirst, it is understood that there is a shortage of fire within the stomach, and the Äyur-vedic treatment is performed in connection with the fire element, agni-mändyam. Since fire is increased by the secretion of bile, the treatment is to increase bile secretion. The Äyur-vedic treatment thus corroborates the statements in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The characteristic of fire in subduing the influence of cold is known to everyone. Severe cold can always be counteracted by fire."
