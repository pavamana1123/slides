In the çuddha-sattva status there is no infringement of the other qualities, namely passion and ignorance. In the Vedic literature there is mention of the Lord's expansion as the four Personalities of Godhead—Väsudeva, Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Here in the reappearance of the mahat-tattva the four expansions of Godhead occur. He who is seated within as Supersoul expands first as Väsudeva."

            "content": "The väsudeva stage is free from infringement by material desires and is the status in which one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the objective which is described in the Bhagavad-gétä as adbhuta. This is another feature of the mahat-tattva. The väsudeva expansion is also called Kåñëa consciousness, for it is free from all tinges of material passion and ignorance. This clear state of understanding helps one to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The väsudeva status is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä as kñetra-jïa, which refers to the knower of the field of activities as well as the Superknower. The living being who has occupied a particular type of body knows that body, but the Superknower, Väsudeva, knows not only a particular type of body but also the field of activities in all the different varieties of bodies. In order to be situated in clear consciousness, or Kåñëa consciousness, one must worship Väsudeva. Väsudeva is Kåñëa alone. When Kåñëa, or Viñëu, is alone, without the accompaniment of His internal energy, He is Väsudeva. When He is accompanied by His internal potency, He is called Dvärakädhéça. To have clear consciousness, or Kåñëa consciousness, one has to worship Väsudeva. It is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä that after many, many births one surrenders to Väsudeva. Such a great soul is very rare."

            "content": "In order to get release from the false ego, one has to worship Saìkarñaëa. Saìkarñaëa is also worshiped through Lord Çiva; the snakes which cover the body of Lord Çiva are representations of Saìkarñaëa, and Lord Çiva is always absorbed in meditation upon Saìkarñaëa. One who is actually a worshiper of Lord Çiva as a devotee of Saìkarñaëa can be released from false, material ego. If one wants to get free from mental disturbances, one has to worship Aniruddha. For this purpose, worship of the moon planet is also recommended in the Vedic literature. Similarly, to be fixed in one's intelligence one has to worship Pradyumna, who is reached through the worship of Brahmä. These matters are explained in Vedic literature."
