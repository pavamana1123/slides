    "translation": "This universal egg, or the universe in the shape of an egg, is called the manifestation of material energy. Its layers of water, air, fire, sky, ego and mahat-tattva increase in thickness one after another. Each layer is ten times bigger than the previous one, and the final outside layer is covered by pradhäna. Within this egg is the universal form of Lord Hari, of whose body the fourteen planetary systems are parts.",

As an egg is covered by a shell, the universe is also covered by various layers. The first layer is water, the next is fire, then air, then sky, and the ultimate holding crust is pradhäna. Within this egglike universe is the universal form of the Lord as the viräö-puruña. All the different planetary situations are parts of His body. This is already explained in the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Second Canto. The planetary systems are considered to form different bodily parts of that universal form of the Lord. Persons who cannot directly engage in the worship of the transcendental form of the Lord are advised to think of and worship this universal form. The lowest planetary system, Pätäla, is considered to be the sole of the Supreme Lord, and the earth is considered to be the belly of the Lord. Brahmaloka, or the highest planetary system, where Brahmä lives, is considered to be the head of the Lord."

The viräö-puruña is also puruña, but He is not ädi-puruña. The ädi-puruña is Kåñëa. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù/ anädir ädir govindaù (BS 5.1). In Bhagavad-gétä Kåñëa is also accepted as the ädi-puruña, the original. Kåñëa says, \"No one is greater than I.\" There are innumerable expansions of the Lord, and all of them are puruñas, or enjoyers, but neither the viräö-puruña nor the puruña-avatäras—Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu—nor any of the many other expansions, is the original. In each universe there are Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, the viräö-puruña and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. The active manifestation of the viräö-puruña is described here. persons who are in the lower grade of understanding regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead may think of the universal form of the Lord, for that is advised in the Bhägavatam."

The outer covering is made of layers of water, air, fire, sky, ego and mahat-tattva, and each layer is ten times greater than the one previous. The space within the hollow of the universe cannot be measured by any human scientist or anyone else, and beyond the hollow there are seven coverings, each one ten times greater than the one preceding it. The layer of water is ten times greater than the diameter of the universe, and the layer of fire is ten times greater than that of water. Similarly, the layer of air is ten times greater than that of fire. These dimensions are all inconceivable to the tiny brain of a human being."

It is considered, in fact, that this universe is the smallest; therefore the predominating superintendent, or Brahmä, has only four heads for management. In other universes, which are far greater than this one, Brahmä has more heads. In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is stated that all these Brahmäs were called one day by Lord Kåñëa on the inquiry of the small Brahmä, who, after seeing all the larger Brahmäs, was thunderstruck. That is the inconceivable potency of the Lord. No one can measure the length and breadth of God by speculation or by false identification with God. These attempts are symptoms of lunacy."
