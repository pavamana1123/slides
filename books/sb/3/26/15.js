It is stated also in the Viñëu Puräëa that whatever we see is parasya brahmaëaù çaktiù; everything is an expansion of the energy of the Supreme Absolute Truth, Brahman. When Brahman is mixed with the three qualities goodness, passion and ignorance, there results the material expansion, which is sometimes called saguëa Brahman and which consists of these twenty-five elements. In the nirguëa Brahman, where there is no material contamination, or in the spiritual world, the three modes—goodness, passion and ignorance—are not present. Where nirguëa Brahman is found, simple unalloyed goodness prevails. Saguëa Brahman is described by the Säìkhya system of philosophy as consisting of twenty-five elements, including the time factor (past, present and future)."
