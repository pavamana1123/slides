At that time when the causes were unmixed, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His feature of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, entered within each universe. Accompanying Him were all of the seven primary elements—the five material elements, the total energy (mahat-tattva) and the false ego. This entrance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead involves His entering even the atoms of the material world. This is confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38): aëòäntara-stha-paramäëu-cayäntara-stham. He is not only within the universe, but within the atoms also. He is within the heart of every living entity. Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, entered into everything."
