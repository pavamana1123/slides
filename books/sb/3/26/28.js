            "content": "The system of yoga entails controlling the mind, and the Lord of the mind is Aniruddha. It is stated that Aniruddha is four-handed, with Sudarçana cakra, conchshell, club and lotus flower. There are twenty-four forms of Viñëu, each differently named. Among these twenty-four forms, Saìkarñaëa, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Väsudeva are depicted very nicely in the Caitanya-caritämåta, where it is stated that Aniruddha is worshiped by the yogés. Meditation upon voidness is a modern invention of the fertile brain of some speculator. Actually the process of yoga meditation, as prescribed in this verse, should be fixed upon the form of Aniruddha. By meditating on Aniruddha one can become free from the agitation of acceptance and rejection. When one's mind is fixed upon Aniruddha, one gradually becomes God-realized; he approaches the pure status of Kåñëa consciousness, which is the ultimate goal of yoga."
