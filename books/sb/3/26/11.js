The sum total of the living entities is impregnated into this yonir mahad brahma, and they are born in different forms, beginning from Brahmä down to the insignificant ant. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam and other Vedic literatures, the sum total of the twenty-four elements, pradhäna, is also described as yonir mahad brahma; it is the source of the birth and subsistence of all living entities."
