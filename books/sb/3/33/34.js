The ocean gave Him residence at a place still known as Gaìgä-sägara, where the River Ganges meets the sea. That place is called Gaìgä-sägara-tértha, and even today people gather there to offer respects to Kapiladeva, the original author of the Säìkhya system of philosophy. Unfortunately, this Säìkhya system has been misrepresented by an imposter who is also named Kapila, but that other system of philosophy does not tally with anything described in the Säìkhya of Kapila in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam."
