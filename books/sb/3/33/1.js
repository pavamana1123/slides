    "translation": "Çré Maitreya said: Thus Devahüti, the mother of Lord Kapila and wife of Kardama Muni, became freed from all ignorance concerning devotional service and transcendental knowledge. She offered her obeisances unto the Lord, the author of the basic principles of the Säìkhya system of philosophy, which is the background of liberation, and she satisfied Him with the following verses of prayer.",

The specific significance of this system of philosophy is stated herein as siddhi-bhümim—it is the background of salvation. People who are suffering in this material world because they are conditioned by the material energy can easily get freedom from the clutches of matter by understanding the Säìkhya philosophy enunciated by Lord Kapila. By this system of philosophy, one can immediately become free, even though one is situated in this material world. That stage is called jévan-mukti. This means that one is liberated even though one stays with his material body. That happened for Devahüti, the mother of Lord Kapila, and she therefore satisfied the Lord by offering her prayers. Anyone who understands the basic principle of Säìkhya philosophy is elevated in devotional service and becomes fully Kåñëa conscious, or liberated, even within this material world."
