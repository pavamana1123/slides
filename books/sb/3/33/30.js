            "content": "Three words have been used in this connection to describe the achievement of Devahüti: ätmänam, brahma-nirväëam and bhagavantam. These refer to the gradual process of discovery of the Absolute Truth, mentioned herein as the bhagavantam. The Supreme Personality of Godhead resides in various Vaikuëöha planets. Nirväëa means to extinguish the pangs of material existence. When one is able to enter into the spiritual kingdom or into spiritual realization, one is automatically freed from material pangs. That is called brahma-nirväëa. According to Vedic scripture, nirväëa means cessation of the materialistic way of life. Ätmänam means realization of the Supersoul within the heart. Ultimately, the highest perfection is realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is to be understood that Devahüti entered the planet which is called Kapila Vaikuëöha. There are innumerable Vaikuëöha planets predominated by the expansions of Viñëu. All the Vaikuëöha planets are known by a particular name of Viñëu. As we understand from Brahma-saàhitä, advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam (BS 5.33). Ananta means \"innumerable.\" The Lord has innumerable expansions of His transcendental form, and according to the different positions of the symbolical representations in His four hands, He is known as Näräyaëa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Väsudeva, etc. There is also a Vaikuëöha planet known as Kapila Vaikuëöha, to which Devahüti was promoted to meet Kapila and reside there eternally, enjoying the company of her transcendental son."
