But Brahmä, being the first living creature within this universe, was born directly from the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is known as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, the Viñëu form lying down in the ocean at the bottom of the universe. Devahüti wanted to impress upon the Lord that when Brahmä wants to see Him, he has to meditate upon Him. \"You are the seed of all creation,\" she said. \"Although Brahmä was directly born from You, he still has to perform many years of meditation, and even then he cannot see You directly, face to face. Your body is lying within the vast water at the bottom of the universe, and thus You are known as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu.\""

Since the material manifestation has come from His body, His body therefore existed before the material creation. The conclusion is that the transcendental body of Viñëu is not made of material elements. The body of Viñëu is the source of all other living entities, as well as the material nature, which is also supposed to be the energy of that Supreme Personality of Godhead. Devahüti said, \"You are the background of the material manifestation and all created energy; therefore Your delivering me from the clutches of mäyä by explaining the system of Säìkhya philosophy is not so astonishing. But Your being born from my abdomen is certainly wonderful because although You are the source of all creation, You have so kindly taken birth as my child. That is most wonderful. Your body is the source of all the universe, and still You put Your body within the abdomen of a common woman like me. To me, that is most astonishing.\""
