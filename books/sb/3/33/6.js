            "content": "Herein the spiritual potency of chanting, hearing or remembering the holy name of the Supreme Lord is greatly stressed. Rüpa Gosvämé has discussed the sequence of sinful activities of the conditioned soul, and he has established, in Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu, that those who engage in devotional service become freed from the reactions of all sinful activities. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä. The Lord says that He takes charge of one who surrenders unto Him, and He makes him immune to all reactions to sinful activities. If by chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead one becomes so swiftly cleared of all reactions to sinful activities, then what is to be said of those persons who see Him face to face?"

            "content": "Another consideration here is that persons who are purified by the process of chanting and hearing become immediately eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. Generally, only a person who is born in a family of brähmaëas, who has been reformed by the ten kinds of purificatory processes and who is learned in Vedic literature is allowed to perform the Vedic sacrifices. But here the word sadyaù, \"immediately,\" is used, and Çrédhara Svämé also remarks that one can immediately become eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. A person born in a family of the low caste which is accustomed to eat dogs is so positioned due to his past sinful activities, but by chanting or hearing once in pureness, or in an offenseless manner, he is immediately relieved of the sinful reaction. Not only is he relieved of the sinful reaction, but he immediately achieves the result of all purificatory processes. Taking birth in the family of a brähmaëa is certainly due to pious activities in one's past life. But still a child who is born in a family of a brähmaëa depends for his further reformation upon initiation into acceptance of a sacred thread and many other reformatory processes. But a person who chants the holy name of the Lord, even if born in a family of caëòälas, dog-eaters, does not need reformation. Simply by chanting Hare Kåñëa, he immediately becomes purified and becomes as good as the most learned brähmaëa."

Of course, that depends on the individual process of chanting, but this remark of Çrédhara Svämé's is completely applicable if one chants the holy name of the Lord without offense, for he immediately becomes more than a brähmaëa. As Çrédhara Svämé says, püjyatvam: he immediately becomes as respectable as a most learned brähmaëa and can be allowed to perform Vedic sacrifices. If simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes sanctified instantly, then what can be said of those persons who see the Supreme Lord face to face and who understand the descent of the Lord, as Devahüti understands Kapiladeva."

            "content": "Usually, initiation depends on the bona fide spiritual master, who directs the disciple. If he sees that a disciple has become competent and purified by the process of chanting, he offers the sacred thread to the disciple just so that he will be recognized as one-hundred-percent equal with a brähmaëa. This is also confirmed in the Hari-bhakti-viläsa by Çré Sanätana Gosvämé: \"As a base metal like bell metal can be changed into gold by a chemical process, any person can similarly be changed into a brähmaëa by dékñä-vidhäna, the initiation process\"."

            "content": "It is sometimes remarked that by the chanting process one begins to purify himself and can take birth in his next life in a brähmaëa family and then be reformed. But at this present moment, even those who are born in the best brähmaëa families are not reformed, nor is there any certainty that they are actually born of brähmaëa fathers. Formerly the garbhädhäna reformatory system was prevalent, but at the present moment there is no such garbhädhäna, or seed-giving ceremony. Under these circumstances, no one knows if a man is factually born of a brähmaëa father. Whether one has acquired the qualification of a brähmaëa depends on the judgment of the bona fide spiritual master. He bestows upon the disciple the position of a brähmaëa by his own judgment. When one is accepted as a brähmaëa in the sacred thread ceremony under the päïcarätrika system, then he is dvija, twice-born. That is confirmed by Sanätana Gosvämé: dvijatvaà jäyate. By the process of initiation by the spiritual master, a person is accepted as a brähmaëa in his purified state of chanting the holy name of the Lord. He then makes further progress to become a qualified Vaiñëava, which means that the brahminical qualification is already acquired."
