            "content": "In this verse the word daiva-guptam, \"protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\" is very significant. Once one surrenders unto the service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord takes charge of the maintenance of the devotee's body, and there is no need of anxiety for its protection. It is said in the Second Chapter, Second Canto, of Çrémad-Bhägavatam that a fully surrendered soul has no anxiety about the maintenance of his body. The Supreme Lord takes care of the maintenance of innumerable species of bodies; therefore, one who fully engages in His service will not go unprotected by the Supreme Lord. Devahüti was naturally unmindful of the protection of her body, which was being taken care of by the Supreme Person."
