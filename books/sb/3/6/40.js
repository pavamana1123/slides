The answer is that the transcendental ecstasy enjoyed by the devotees in delineating the pastimes of the Lord is certainly unknown to nondevotees and mental speculators. Unless one relishes transcendental joy, naturally one will come back from his speculations and concocted conclusions because he will see them as neither factual nor enjoyable. The devotees can at least know that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Viñëu, as the Vedic hymns confirm: oà tad viñëoù paramaà padaà sadä paçyanti sürayaù. Bhagavad-gétä : bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù. Only by devotional service can one know that the ultimate truth is the Personality of Godhead and that Brahman and Paramätmä are only His partial features. This is confirmed in this verse by the great sage Maitreya. With devotion he offers his sincere surrender, namaù, to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, bhagavate. One has to follow in the footsteps of great sages and devotees like Maitreya and Vidura, Mahäräja Parékñit and Çukadeva Gosvämé, and engage in the transcendental devotional service of the Lord if one would know His ultimate feature, which is above Brahman and Paramätmä."
