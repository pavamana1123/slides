            "content": "The Supreme Lord expands Himself in two ways, by personal plenary expansions and separated minute expansions. The personal plenary expansions are viñëu-tattvas, and the separated expansions are living entities. Since the living entities are very small, they are sometimes described as the marginal energy of the Lord. But the mystic yogés consider the living entities and the Supersoul, Paramätmä, to be one and the same. It is, however, a minor point of controversy; after all, everything created rests on the gigantic viräö or universal form of the Lord."
