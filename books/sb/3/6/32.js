In Bhagavad-gétä also the duties of the vaiçyas, who are engaged in viça, are stated as cow protection, agriculture and business. We have already discussed that the human being can safely depend on the cow and agricultural land for his livelihood."

The vaiçyas are divided into many subsections: some of them are called kñetré, or landowners, some are called kåñaëa, or land tillers, some of them are called tila-vaëik, or grain raisers, some are called gandha-vaëik, or merchants in spices, and some are called suvarëa-vaëik, or merchants in gold and banking. The brähmaëas are the teachers and spiritual masters, the kñatriyas protect the citizens from the hands of thieves and miscreants, and the vaiçyas are in charge of production and distribution. The çüdras, the unintelligent class of men who cannot act independently in any of the above-mentioned activities, are meant for serving the three higher classes for their livelihood."

            "content": "Formerly, the brähmaëas were given all the necessities of life by the kñatriyas and vaiçyas because they had no time to spend making a living. The kñatriyas would collect taxes from the vaiçyas and çüdras, but the brähmaëas were exempt from paying income tax or land revenue. That system of human society was so nice that there were no political, social and economic upheavals. The different castes, or varëa classifications, are therefore essential for maintaining a peaceful human society."
