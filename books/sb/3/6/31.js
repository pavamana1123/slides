The word anuvrataù is significant. A person who follows the kñatriya principles by protecting society from thieves and miscreants is called a kñatriya, not the one who is simply born a kñatriya. The conception of the caste system is always based on quality and not on the qualification of birth. Birth is an extraneous consideration; it is not the main feature of the orders and divisions. In Bhagavad-gétä  the qualifications of the brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras are specifically mentioned, and it is understood that all such qualifications are needed before one can be designated as belonging to a particular group."

            "content": "Lord Viñëu is always mentioned as the puruña in all Vedic scriptures. Sometimes the living entities are also mentioned as puruñas, although they are essentially puruña-çakti (parä çakti or parä prakåti), the superior energy of the puruña. Illusioned by the external potency of the puruña (the Lord), the living entities falsely think of themselves as the puruña although they actually have no qualifications. The Lord has the power to protect. Of the three deities Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara, the first has the power to create, the second has the power to protect, and the third has the power to destroy. The word puruña is significant in this verse because the kñatriyas are expected to represent the puruña Lord in giving protection to the prajäs, or all those who are born in the land and water. Protection is therefore meant for both man and the animals. In modern society the prajäs are not protected from the hands of thieves and miscreants. The modern democratic state, which has no kñatriyas, is a government of the vaiçyas and çüdras, and not of brähmaëas and kñatriyas as formerly. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and his grandson, Mahäräja Parékñit, were typical kñatriya kings, for they gave protection to all men and animals. When the personification of Kali attempted to kill a cow, Mahäräja Parékñit at once prepared himself to kill the miscreant, and the personification of Kali was banished from his kingdom. That is the sign of puruña, or the representative of Lord Viñëu. According to Vedic civilization, a qualified kñatriya monarch is given the respect of the Lord because he represents the Lord by giving protection to the prajäs. Modern elected presidents cannot even give protection from theft cases, and therefore one has to take protection from an insurance company. The problems of modern human society are due to the lack of qualified brähmaëas and kñatriyas and the overinfluence of the vaiçyas and çüdras by so-called general franchise."
