The total consciousness is that of the gigantic viräö-rüpa, and the same consciousness is exhibited in individual persons. The activity of consciousness is performed through the air of life, which is of ten divisions. The airs of life are called präëa, apäna, udäna, vyäna and samäna and are also differently qualified as näga, kürma, kåkara, devadatta and dhanaïjaya. The consciousness of the soul becomes polluted by the material atmosphere, and thus various activities are exhibited in the false ego of bodily identification. These various activities are described in Bhagavad-gétä  as bahu-çäkhä hy anantäç ca buddhayo 'vyavasäyinäm. The conditioned soul is bewildered into various activities for want of pure consciousness. In pure consciousness the activity is one. The consciousness of the individual soul becomes one with the supreme consciousness when there is complete synthesis between the two."

            "content": "The monist believes that there is only one consciousness, whereas the sätvatas, or the devotees, believe that although there is undoubtedly one consciousness, they are one because there is agreement. The individual consciousness is advised to dovetail with the supreme consciousness, as instructed by the Lord in Bhagavad-gétä : sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja. The individual consciousness (Arjuna) is advised to dovetail with the supreme consciousness and thus maintain his conscious purity. It is foolish to try to stop the activities of consciousness, but they can be purified when they are dovetailed with the Supreme. This consciousness is divided into three modes of self-identification according to the proportion of purity: ädhyätmika, or self-identification with the body and mind, ädhibhautika, or self-identification with the material products, and ädhidaivika, or self-identification as a servant of the Lord. Of the three, ädhidaivika self-identification is the beginning of purity of consciousness in pursuance of the desire of the Lord."
