It is manifested by the supreme will of the Lord after the ingredients of material creation. Lord Kåñëa exhibited this viräö or viçva-rüpa to Arjuna just to convince the impersonalists that He is the original Personality of Godhead. Kåñëa exhibited the viräö-rüpa; it is not that Kåñëa was exhibited by the viräö-rüpa. The viräö-rüpa is not, therefore, an eternal form of the Lord exhibited in the spiritual sky; it is a material manifestation of the Lord. The arcä-vigraha, or the worshipable Deity in the temple, is a similar manifestation of the Lord for the neophytes. But in spite of their material touch, such forms of the Lord as the viräö and arcä are all nondifferent from His eternal form as Lord Kåñëa."
