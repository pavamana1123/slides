All are combined together by the influence of time and are again dissolved in the course of time. Time, therefore, is the energy of the Lord and acts in her own way by the direction of the Lord. This energy is called Kälé and is represented by the dark destructive goddess generally worshiped by persons influenced by the mode of darkness or ignorance in material existence. In the Vedic hymn this process is described as müla-prakåtir avikåtir mahadädyäù prakåti-vikåtayaù sapta ñoòaçakas tu vikäro na prakåtir na vikåtiù puruñaù. The energy which acts as material nature in a combination of twenty-three ingredients is not the final source of creation. The Lord enters into the elements and applies His energy, called Kälé. In all other Vedic scriptures the same principle is accepted. In Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38) it is stated:"
