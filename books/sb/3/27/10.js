            "content": "Consciousness acts in three stages under the material conception of life. When we are awake, consciousness acts in a particular way, when we are asleep it acts in a different way, and when we are in deep sleep, consciousness acts in still another way. To become Kåñëa conscious, one has to become transcendental to these three stages of consciousness. Our present consciousness should be freed from all perceptions of life other than consciousness of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called düré-bhütänya-darçanaù, which means that when one attains perfect Kåñëa consciousness he does not see anything but Kåñëa. In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is said that the perfect devotee may see many movable and immovable objects, but in everything he sees that the energy of Kåñëa is acting. As soon as he remembers the energy of Kåñëa, he immediately remembers Kåñëa in His personal form. Therefore in all his observations he sees Kåñëa only. In the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38) it is stated that when one's eyes are smeared with love of Kåñëa (premäïjana-cchurita), he always sees Kåñëa, outside and inside. This is confirmed here; one should be freed from all other vision, and in that way he is freed from the false egoistic identification and sees himself as the eternal servitor of the Lord. Cakñuñevärkam: as we can see the sun without a doubt, one who is fully developed in Kåñëa consciousness sees Kåñëa and His energy. By this vision one becomes ätma-dåk, or self-realized. When the false ego of identifying the body with the self is removed, actual vision of life is perceivable. The senses, therefore, also become purified. Real service of the Lord begins when the senses are purified. One does not have to stop the activities of the senses, but the false ego of identifying with the body has to be removed. Then the senses automatically become purified, and with purified senses one can actually discharge devotional service."
