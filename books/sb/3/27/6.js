Yama and niyama mean practicing the controlling process by following strict regulations, and äsana refers to the sitting postures. These help raise one to the standard of faithfulness in devotional service. The practice of yoga by physical exercise is not the ultimate goal; the real end is to concentrate and to control the mind and train oneself to be situated in faithful devotional service."

            "content": "Rüpa Gosvämé explains very nicely in Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu how this bhäva, or preliminary stage of love of God, is achieved. He states that one first of all has to become faithful (çraddhayänvitaù). Faith is attained by controlling the senses, either by yoga practice, following the rules and regulations and practicing the sitting postures, or by engaging directly in bhakti-yoga, as recommended in the previous verse. Of the nine different items of bhakti-yoga, the first and foremost is to chant and hear about the Lord. That is also mentioned here. Mat-kathä-çravaëena ca. One may come to the standard of faithfulness by following the rules and regulations of the yoga system, and the same goal can be achieved simply by chanting and hearing about the transcendental activities of the Lord. The word ca is significant. Bhakti-yoga is direct, and the other process is indirect. But even if the indirect process is taken, there is no success unless one comes fully to the direct process of hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. Therefore the word satyena is used here. In this connection Svämé Çrédhara comments that satyena means niñkapaöena, \"without duplicity.\" The impersonalists are full of duplicity. Sometimes they pretend to execute devotional service, but their ultimate idea is to become one with the Supreme. This is duplicity, kapaöa. The Bhägavatam does not allow this duplicity. In the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is clearly stated, paramo nirmatsaräëäm:  \"This treatise Çrémad-Bhägavatam is meant for those who are completely free from envy.\" The same point is again stressed here. Unless one is completely faithful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages himself in the process of hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, there is no possibility for liberation."
