            "content": "One who actually wants to be liberated from the entanglement of this material world and go back home, back to Godhead, is actually a mystic yogé. The words explicitly used here are yuktena bhakti-yogena. Those yogés, or mystics, who engage in devotional service are the first-class yogés. The first-class yogés, as described in Bhagavad-gétä, are those who are constantly thinking of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. These yogés are not without knowledge and renunciation. To become a bhakti-yogé means to automatically attain knowledge and renunciation. That is the consequent result of bhakti-yoga. In the Bhägavatam, First Canto, Second Chapter, it is also confirmed that one who engages in the devotional service of Väsudeva, Kåñëa, has complete transcendental knowledge and renunciation, and there is no explanation for these attainments. Ahaituké—without reason, they come. Even if a person is completely illiterate, the transcendental knowledge of the scriptures is revealed unto him simply because of his engagement in devotional service. That is also stated in the Vedic literature. To anyone who has full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the spiritual master, all the import of the Vedic literatures is revealed. He does not have to seek separately; the yogés who engage in devotional service are full in knowledge and renunciation. If there is a lack of knowledge and renunciation, it is to be understood that one is not in full devotional service. The conclusion is that one cannot be sure of entrance into the spiritual realm—in either the impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence of the Lord or the Vaikuëöha planets within that Brahman effulgence—unless he is surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. The surrendered souls are called akuto-bhaya. They are doubtless and fearless, and their entrance into the spiritual kingdom is guaranteed."
