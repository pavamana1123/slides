Here the word ädyaù means \"the origin of all living entities,\" and puàsäm éçvaraù means \"the Lord (éçvara) of the living entities\" (éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù (BS 5.1)). Kapila Muni is the direct expansion of Kåñëa, who is the sun of spiritual knowledge. As the sun dissipates the darkness of the universe, so when the light of the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes down, it at once dissipates the darkness of mäyä. We have our eyes, but without the light of the sun our eyes are of no value. Similarly, without the light of the Supreme Lord, or without the divine grace of the spiritual master, one cannot see things as they are."
