Guëeñu, or mäyä consciousness, involves attachment to the three material modes of nature, under which one works sometimes in goodness and knowledge, sometimes in passion and sometimes in ignorance. These different qualitative activities, with the central attachment for material enjoyment, are the cause of one's conditional life. When the same cetaù, or consciousness, is transferred to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, or when one becomes Kåñëa conscious, he is on the path of liberation."
