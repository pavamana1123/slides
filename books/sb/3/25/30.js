    "translation": "My dear son, Kapila, after all, I am a woman. It is very difficult for me to understand the Absolute Truth because my intelligence is not very great. But if You will kindly explain it to me, even though I am not very intelligent, I can understand it and thereby feel transcendental happiness.",

Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura therefore says, yasya prasädäd, by the mercy of the spiritual master, the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, bhagavat-prasädaù, is revealed. Devahüti requested her great son to be merciful towards her because she was a less intelligent woman and also His mother. By the grace of Kapiladeva it was quite possible for her to understand the Absolute Truth, even though the subject matter is very difficult for ordinary persons, especially women."
