This is confirmed in the Vedas also: eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän. He is the supreme living entity and is supplying the necessities of all other living entities. Thus all other living entities, both viñëu-tattva and jéva-tattva, are subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. The same concept is confirmed here. Na hy asya varñmaëaù puàsäm: amongst the living entities, no one can surpass the Supreme Person because no one is richer, more famous, stronger, more beautiful, wiser or more renounced than He. These qualifications make Him the Supreme Godhead, the cause of all causes. Yogés are very proud of performing wonderful feats, but no one can compare to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Devotees may not be as powerful as the Supreme Lord, but by constant association with the Lord they become as good as the Lord Himself. Sometimes the devotees act more powerfully than the Lord. Of course, that is the Lord's concession."

            "content": "Also used here is the word varimëaù, meaning \"the most worshipful of all yogés.\" To hear from Kåñëa is the real pleasure of the senses; therefore He is known as Govinda, for by His words, by His teachings, by His instruction—by everything connected with Him—He enlivens the senses. Whatever He instructs is from the transcendental platform, and His instructions, being absolute, are nondifferent from Him. Hearing from Kåñëa or His expansion or plenary expansion like Kapila is very pleasing to the senses. Bhagavad-gétä can be read or heard many times, but because it gives great pleasure, the more one reads Bhagavad-gétä the more he gets the appetite to read and understand it, and each time he gets new enlightenment. That is the nature of the transcendental message. Similarly, we find that transcendental happiness in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The more we hear and chant the glories of the Lord, the more we become happy."
