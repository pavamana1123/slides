Çaunaka Åñi requested Süta Gosvämé to describe what he had actually heard from his spiritual master, Çukadeva Gosvämé, about the transcendental pastimes the Lord manifested by His internal energy. Bhagavän, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has no material body, but He can assume any kind of body by His supreme will. That is made possible by His internal energy."
