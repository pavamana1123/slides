    "translation": "Upon seeing the charming forms of the Lord, smiling and attractive, and hearing His very pleasing words, the pure devotee almost loses all other consciousness. His senses are freed from all other engagements, and he becomes absorbed in devotional service. Thus in spite of his unwillingness, he attains liberation without separate endeavor.",

            "content": "There are three divisions of devotees—first-class, second-class and third-class. Even the third-class devotees are liberated souls. It is explained in this verse that although they do not have knowledge, simply by seeing the beautiful decoration of the Deity in the temple, the devotee is absorbed in thought of Him and loses all other consciousness. Simply by fixing oneself in Kåñëa consciousness, engaging the senses in the service of the Lord, one is imperceptibly liberated. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä. Simply by discharging uncontaminated devotional service as prescribed in the scriptures, one becomes equal to Brahman. In Bhagavad-gétä it is said, brahma-bhüyäya kalpate  This means that the living entity in his original state is Brahman because he is part and parcel of the Supreme Brahman. But simply because of his forgetfulness of his real nature as an eternal servitor of the Lord, he is overwhelmed and captured by mäyä. His forgetfulness of his real constitutional position is mäyä. Otherwise he is eternally Brahman."

            "content": "When one is trained to become conscious of his position, he understands that he is the servitor of the Lord. \"Brahman\" refers to a state of self-realization. Even the third-class devotee—who is not advanced in knowledge of the Absolute Truth but simply offers obeisances with great devotion, thinks of the Lord, sees the Lord in the temple and brings forth flowers and fruits to offer to the Deity—becomes imperceptibly liberated. Çraddhayänvitäù: with great devotion the devotees offer worshipful respects and paraphernalia to the Deity. The Deities of Rädhä and Kåñëa, Lakñmé and Näräyaëa, and Räma and Sétä are very attractive to devotees, so much so that when they see the statue decorated in the temple of the Lord they become fully absorbed in thought of the Lord. That is the state of liberation. In other words, it is confirmed herewith that even a third-class devotee is in the transcendental position, above those who are trying for liberation by speculation or by other methods. Even great impersonalists like Çukadeva Gosvämé and the four Kumäras were attracted by the beauty of the Deities in the temple, by the decorations and by the aroma of tulasé offered to the Lord, and they became devotees. Even though they were in the liberated state, instead of remaining impersonalists they were attracted by the beauty of the Lord and became devotees."

            "content": "Here the word viläsa is very important. Viläsa refers to the activities or pastimes of the Lord. It is a prescribed duty in temple worship that not only should one visit the temple to see the Deity nicely decorated, but at the same time he should hear the recitation of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Bhagavad-gétä or some similar literature, which is regularly recited in the temple. It is the system in Våndävana that in every temple there is recitation of the çästras. Even third-class devotees who have no literary knowledge or no time to read Çrémad-Bhägavatam or Bhagavad-gétä get the opportunity to hear about the pastimes of the Lord. In this way their minds may remain always absorbed in the thought of the Lord—His form, His activities and His transcendental nature. This state of Kåñëa consciousness is a liberated stage. Lord Caitanya, therefore, recommended five important processes in the discharge of devotional service: (1) to chant the holy names of the Lord, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, (2) to associate with devotees and serve them as far as possible, (3) to hear Çrémad-Bhägavatam, (4) to see the decorated temple and the Deity and, if possible, (5) to live in a place like Våndävana or Mathurä. These five items alone can help a devotee achieve the highest perfectional stage. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä and here in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. That third-class devotees can also imperceptibly achieve liberation is accepted in all Vedic literatures."
