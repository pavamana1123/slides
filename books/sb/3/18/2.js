            "content": "In a previous chapter we have discussed the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Varäha, the boar. While Varäha, with His tusks, engaged in uplifting the submerged earth from the depths of the waters, this great demon Hiraëyäkña met Him and challenged Him, calling Him a beast. Demons cannot understand the incarnations of the Lord; they think that His incarnations as a fish or boar or tortoise are big beasts only. They misunderstand the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even in His human form, and they deride His descent. In the Caitanya-sampradäya there is sometimes a demoniac misconception about the descent of Nityänanda Prabhu. Nityänanda Prabhu's body is spiritual, but demoniac persons consider the body of the Supreme Personality to be material, just like ours. Avajänanti mäà müòhäù:  persons who have no intelligence deride the transcendental form of the Lord as material."
