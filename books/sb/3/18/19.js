    "translation": "There was keen rivalry between the two combatants; both had sustained injuries on their bodies from the blows of each other's pointed maces, and each grew more and more enraged at the smell of blood on his person. In their eagerness to win, they performed maneuvers of various kinds, and their contest looked like an encounter between two forceful bulls for the sake of a cow.",

Actually, Bhärata-varña is the name for the entire planet, but gradually Bhärata-varña has come to mean India. As India has recently been divided into Pakistan and Hindustan, similarly the earth was formerly called Ilävåta-varña, but gradually as time passed it was divided by national boundaries."
