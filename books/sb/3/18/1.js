The demon was very encouraged to learn from Varuëa that there was one fighter who could actually combat him, and he was very enthusiastic to search out the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to give Him a fight, even though it was predicted by Varuëa that by fighting with Viñëu he would become prey for dogs, jackals and vultures. Since demoniac persons are less intelligent, they dare to fight with Viñëu, who is known as Ajita, or one who has never been conquered."
