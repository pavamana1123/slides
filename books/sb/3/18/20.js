The earth planet is also called go, or cow. As bulls fight between themselves to ascertain who will have union with a cow, there is always a constant fight between the demons and the Supreme Lord or His representative for supremacy over the earth. Here the Lord is significantly described as yajïävayava. One should not consider the Lord to have the body of an ordinary boar. He can assume any form, and He possesses all such forms eternally. It is from Him that all other forms have emanated. This boar form is not to be considered the form of an ordinary hog; His body is actually full of yajïa, or worshipful offerings. Yajïa (sacrifices) are offered to Viñëu. Yajïa means the body of Viñëu. His body is not material; therefore He should not be taken to be an ordinary boar."

            "content": "Brahmä is described in this verse as svaräö. Actually, full independence is exclusive to the Lord Himself, but as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, every living entity has a minute quantity of independence. Each and every one of the living entities within this universe has this minute independence, but Brahmä, being the chief of all living entities, has a greater potential of independence than any other. He is the representative of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and has been assigned to preside over universal affairs. All other demigods work for him; therefore he is described here as svaräö. He is always accompanied by great sages and transcendentalists, all of whom came to see the bullfight between the demon and the Lord."
