The Lord proved to be a worthy son of His parents even at the age of sixteen years. Both brothers, Lord Kåñëa and Lord Baladeva, went to Mathurä from Våndävana and killed Their maternal uncle, who had given so much trouble to Their parents, Vasudeva and Devaké. Kaàsa was a great giant, and Vasudeva and Devaké never thought that Kåñëa and Balaräma (Baladeva) would be able to kill such a great and strong enemy. When the two brothers attacked Kaàsa on the throne, Their parents feared that now Kaàsa would finally get the opportunity to kill their sons, whom they had hidden for so long in the house of Nanda Mahäräja. The parents of the Lord, due to parental affection, felt extreme danger, and they almost fainted. Just to convince them that They had actually killed Kaàsa, Kåñëa and Baladeva pulled Kaàsa's dead body along the ground to encourage them."
