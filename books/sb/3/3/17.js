This incident is the direct proof that the body and the living entity, the spiritual spark, are different. When the living entity takes shelter in the womb of a woman through the injection of the semen of a man, there is an emulsification of the man's and woman's discharges, and thus a body is formed the size of a pea, gradually developing into a complete body. But if the developing embryo is destroyed in some way or other, the living entity has to take shelter in another body or in the womb of another woman. The particular living entity who was selected to be the descendant of Mahäräja Püru, or the Päëòavas, was not an ordinary living entity, and by the superior will of the Lord he was destined to be the successor to Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. Therefore, when Açvatthämä destroyed the embryo of Mahäräja Parékñit, the Lord, by His own internal potency, entered into the womb of Uttarä by His plenary portion just to give audience to the would-be Mahäräja Parékñit, who was in great danger. By His appearance within the womb, the Lord encouraged the child and gave him complete protection in a new body by His omnipotency. By His power of omnipresence He was present both inside and outside of Uttarä and other members of the Päëòava family."
