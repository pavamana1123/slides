            "content": "Even though the Lord is never attached to any kind of material sex life, as the universal teacher He remained a householder for many, many years, just to teach others how one should live in householder life. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the word samajäyata means \"fully exhibited.\" In all His activities while present on the earth, the Lord exhibited detachment. This was fully displayed when He wanted to teach by example that one should not remain attached to household life for all the days of one's life. One should naturally develop detachment as a matter of course. The Lord's detachment from household life does not indicate detachment from His eternal associates, the transcendental cowherd damsels. But the Lord desired to end His so-called attachment to the three modes of material nature. He can never be detached from the service of His transcendental associates like Rukmiëé and other goddesses of fortune, as described in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38): lakñmé-sahasra-çata-sambhrama-sevyamänam."
