There is a special flowering tree called the pärijäta, which grows only in the heavenly planets, and Satyabhämä wanted this tree. Just to please His wife, like an ordinary husband, the Lord brought back the tree, and this enraged Vajré, or the controller of the thunderbolt. Indra's wives inspired him to run after the Lord to fight, and Indra, because he was a henpecked husband and also a fool, listened to them and dared to fight with Kåñëa. He was a fool on this occasion because he forgot that everything belongs to the Lord."

            "content": "There was no fault on the part of the Lord, even though He took away the tree from the heavenly kingdom, but because Indra was henpecked, dominated by his beautiful wives like Çacé, he became a fool, just as all persons who are dominated by their wives are generally foolish. Indra thought that Kåñëa was a henpecked husband who only by the will of His wife Satyabhämä took away the property of heaven, and therefore he thought that Kåñëa could be punished. He forgot that the Lord is the proprietor of everything and cannot be henpecked. The Lord is fully independent, and by His will only He can have hundreds and thousands of wives like Satyabhämä. He was not, therefore, attached to Satyabhämä because she was a beautiful wife, but He was pleased with her devotional service and thus wanted to reciprocate the unalloyed devotion of His devotee."
