Since the goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, is the property of the Supreme Lord, Rukmiëé was actually meant for Lord Kåñëa. But Çiçupäla was selected as her bridegroom by Rukmiëé's elder brother, although King Bhéñmaka wanted his daughter to be married to Kåñëa. Rukmiëé invited Kåñëa to take her away from the clutches of Çiçupäla, so when the bridegroom, Çiçupäla, came there with his party with the desire to marry Rukmiëé, Kåñëa all of a sudden swept her from the scene, stepping over the heads of all the princes there, just as Garuòa carried away nectar from the hands of the demons. This incident will be clearly explained in the Tenth Canto."
