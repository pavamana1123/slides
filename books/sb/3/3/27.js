The brähmaëas were not giving their services as paid servants, but the society provided them with all necessities. It was arranged for some of the brähmaëas, who were in difficulty for marriage, to be given girls. The brähmaëas, therefore, had no economic problems. The kñatriya kings and rich mercantile men would provide them with all that they needed, and in exchange the brähmaëas were completely devoted to the elevation of society. That was the way of social cooperation between the different castes. When the brähmaëa class or caste gradually became easygoing, being fed by the society although they had no brahminical qualifications, they degraded themselves into brahma-bandhus, or disqualified brähmaëas, and thus other members of society also gradually fell down from the social standard of progressive life. As described in Bhagavad-gétä, the caste system is the creation of the Lord and is arranged according to the quality of work rendered to society and not in terms of birthright, as falsely claimed in the present degraded society."
