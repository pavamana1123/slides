The nitya-siddha devotees never fall down to the region of the material atmosphere, even though they sometimes come onto the material plane to execute the mission of the Lord. The sädhana-siddha devotees are chosen from the conditioned souls. Out of the sädhana devotees, there are mixed and pure devotees. The mixed devotees are sometimes enthusiastic about fruitive activities and are habituated to philosophical speculation. The pure devotees are free from all these mixtures and are completely absorbed in the service of the Lord, regardless of how and where they are situated. Pure devotees of the Lord are not enthusiastic to put aside their service to the Lord in order to go visit holy places of pilgrimage. A great devotee of the Lord in modern times, Çré Narottama däsa Öhäkura, has sung like this: \"To visit holy places of pilgrimage is another bewilderment of the mind because devotional service to the Lord at any place is the last word in spiritual perfection.\""

But those who are not so advanced have the prescribed duties of visiting pilgrimage sites and regularly performing the rituals. The part of the princely order of the Yadu dynasty who went to Prabhäsa performed all duties to be done in a place of pilgrimage and offered their pious actions to their forefathers and others."

Thus everyone is obliged to repay the debt of gratitude. The Yadus who went to the Prabhäsa pilgrimage site performed their duties by distributing land, gold, and well-nourished cows in royal charity, as described in the following verse."
