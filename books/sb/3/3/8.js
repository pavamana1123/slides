He is nondifferent from His innumerable plenary expansions, who are all infallible, original and unlimited and who have eternal forms. Although He is primeval, the oldest personality, He is always fresh and young.\" By His internal potency the Lord can expand Himself into various personalities of svayaà-prakäça and again into präbhava and vaibhava forms, and all of them are nondifferent from one another. The forms into which the Lord expanded to marry the princesses in different apartments were all slightly different just to match each and every one of them. They are called vaibhava-viläsa forms of the Lord and are effected by His internal potency, yoga-mäyä."
