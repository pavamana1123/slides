He therefore created four principles of knowledge: säìkhya, or empirical philosophy for the analytical study of material conditions; yoga, or mysticism for liberation of the pure soul from material bondage; vairägya, the acceptance of complete detachment from material enjoyment in life to elevate oneself to the highest spiritual understanding; and tapas, or the various kinds of voluntary austerities performed for spiritual perfection. Brahmä created the four great sages Sanaka, Sananda, Sanätana and Sanat to entrust them with these four principles of spiritual advancement, and they inaugurated their own spiritual party, or sampradäya, known as the Kumära-sampradäya, or later on as the Nimbärka-sampradäya, for the advancement of bhakti. All of these great sages became great devotees, for without devotional service to the Personality of Godhead one cannot achieve success in any activity of spiritual value."
