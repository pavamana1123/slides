The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be realized by any amount of Vedic knowledge or by any number of penances. But a pure devotee of the Lord like Närada can deliver the Supreme Lord by his good will. The very name Närada suggests that he can deliver the Supreme Lord. Nära means the \"Supreme Lord,\" and da means \"one who can deliver.\" That he can deliver the Supreme Lord does not mean that the Lord is like a commodity that can be delivered to any person. But Närada can deliver to anyone the transcendental loving service of the Lord as a servitor, friend, parent or lover, as one may desire out of one's own transcendental love for the Lord. In other words, it is Närada only who can deliver the path of bhakti-yoga, the highest mystic means for attainment of the Supreme Lord."
