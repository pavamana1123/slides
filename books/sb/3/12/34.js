The Vedas are the source of all knowledge, and they were first revealed to Brahmä by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead while Brahmä was thinking of re-creating the material world. Brahmä is powerful by dint of his devotional service unto the Lord, and the Lord is always ready to forgive His devotee if by chance he falls down from the noble path of devotional service. The Çrémad-Bhägavatam  confirms this as follows:"

The example shown by Brahmä only suggests that the power of material nature is so strong that it can act upon everyone, even Brahmä. Brahmä was saved by the mercy of the Lord with a little punishment, but by the grace of the Lord he did not lose his prestige as the great Brahmä."
