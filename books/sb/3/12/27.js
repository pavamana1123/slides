Even in the most prominent existence of the two lower qualities, the modes of passion and ignorance, there is sometimes a tinge of the mode of goodness. Therefore all the sons generated from the body or the mind of Brahmä were in the modes of passion and ignorance, but some of them, like Kardama, were born in the mode of goodness. Närada was born in the transcendental state of Brahmä."
