They knew very well that even though their father committed a mistake, there must have been some great purpose behind the show, otherwise such a great personality could not have committed such a mistake. It might be that Brahmä wanted to warn his subordinates about human frailties in their dealings with women. This is always very dangerous for persons who are on the path of self-realization. Therefore, great personalities like Brahmä, even when in the wrong, should not be neglected, nor could the great sages headed by Maréci show any disrespect because of his extraordinary behavior."
