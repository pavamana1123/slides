Thus the basic education was designed to encourage the student in becoming free from family encumbrances. Only students unable to accept such a vow in life were allowed to go home and marry a suitable wife. Otherwise, the student would remain a permanent brahmacäré, observing complete abstinence from sex life for his whole life. It all depended on the quality of the student's training. We had the opportunity to meet an avowed brahmacäré in the personality of our spiritual master, Oà Viñëupäda Çré Çrémad Bhaktisiddhänta Gosvämé Mahäräja. Such a great soul is called a naiñöhika-brahmacäré."
