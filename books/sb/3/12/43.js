    "synonyms": "vaikhänasäù—the section of men who retire from active life and live on half-boiled meals; välakhilya—one who quits his former stock of grains on receipt of more; audumbaräù—one who lives on what he gets from the direction towards which he starts after rising from bed; phenapäù—one who lives on the fruits which automatically fall from the tree; vane—in the forest; nyäse—in the order of renunciation; kuöécakaù—life in the family without attachment; pürvam—in the beginning; bahvodaù—giving up all material activities and engaging fully in transcendental service; haàsa—fully engaged in transcendental knowledge; niñkriyau—stopping all kinds of activities.",
    "translation": "The four divisions of retired life are the vaikhänasas, välakhilyas, audumbaras and phenapas. The four divisions of the renounced order of life are the kuöécakas, bahvodas, haàsas and niñkriyas. All these were manifested from Brahmä.",

It is an institution established by Brahmä from the beginning of the creation. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä : cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöam."
