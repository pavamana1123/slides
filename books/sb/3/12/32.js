Therefore, the great sons began to pray to the Supreme Lord for the good sense of Brahmä. It is only by the grace of the Supreme Lord that one can be protected from the allurement of lusty material desires. The Lord gives protection to devotees who are always engaged in His transcendental loving service, and by His causeless mercy He forgives the accidental fall of a devotee. Therefore, sages like Maréci prayed for the mercy of the Lord, and their prayer was fruitful."
