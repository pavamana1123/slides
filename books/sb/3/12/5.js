Those who are serious about gaining release from material bondage should not be entangled in the false relationship of family bondage. People may ask how the Kumäras could refuse the orders of Brahmä, who was their father and above all the creator of the universe. The reply is that one who is väsudeva-paräyaëa, or seriously engaged in the devotional service of the Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva, need not care for any other obligation. It is enjoined in the Bhägavatam :"
