Sometimes the Supreme Personality of Godhead has to become Brahmä when there is no suitable living being to occupy the post. In the material world, Brahmä is the complete representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and transcendental sound, praëava, comes from him. He is therefore invested with multifarious energies, from which all the demigods like Indra, Candra and Varuëa are manifested. His transcendental value is not to be minimized, even though he exhibited a tendency to enjoy his own daughter. There is a purpose for the exhibition of such a tendency by Brahmä, and he is not to be condemned like an ordinary living entity."
