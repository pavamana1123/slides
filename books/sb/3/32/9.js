This material world is vyäkåta, or subject to changes, and it finally dissolves. But after the dissolution of this material world, the manifestation of the spiritual world, the sanätana-dhäma, remains. That spiritual sky is called avyäkåta, that which does not change, and there the Supreme Personality of Godhead resides. When, after ruling over the material universe under the influence of the time element, Lord Brahmä desires to dissolve it and enter into the kingdom of God, others then enter with him."
