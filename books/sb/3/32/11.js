One can reestablish the transcendental loving relationship with the Supreme Lord in so many ways, and that feeling is true oneness. The oneness of the Mäyävädé philosophers and the oneness of Vaiñëava philosophers are different. The Mäyävädé and Vaiñëava philosophers both want to merge into the Supreme, but the Vaiñëavas do not lose their identities. They want to keep the identity of lover, parent, friend or servant."

            "content": "In the transcendental world, the servant and master are one. That is the absolute platform. Although the relationship is servant and master, both the servant and the served stand on the same platform. That is oneness. Lord Kapila advised His mother that she did not need any indirect process. She was already situated in that direct process because the Supreme Lord had taken birth as her son. Actually, she did not need any further instruction because she was already in the perfectional stage. Kapiladeva advised her to continue in the same way. He therefore addressed His mother as bhämini to indicate that she was already thinking of the Lord as her son. Devahüti is advised by Lord Kapila to take directly to devotional service, Kåñëa consciousness, because without that consciousness one cannot become liberated from the clutches of mäyä."
