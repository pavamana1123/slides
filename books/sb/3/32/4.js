There are many heavenly planets to which they aspire just to achieve more and more material happiness by getting a long duration of life and the paraphernalia for sense enjoyment. But the attached persons do not know that even if one goes to the highest planet, Brahmaloka, destruction exists there also. In Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says that one can even go to the Brahmaloka, but still he will find the pangs of birth, death, disease and old age. Only by approaching the Lord's abode, the Vaikuëöhaloka, does one not take birth again in this material world. The gåhamedhés, or materialistic persons, however, do not like to use this advantage. They would prefer to transmigrate perpetually from one body to another, or from one planet to another. They do not want the eternal, blissful life in knowledge in the kingdom of God."

            "content": "There are two kinds of dissolutions. One dissolution takes place at the end of the life of Brahmä. At that time all the planetary systems, including the heavenly systems, are dissolved in water and enter into the body of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who lies on the Garbhodaka Ocean on the bed of serpents, called Çeña. In the other dissolution, which occurs at the end of Brahmä's day, all the lower planetary systems are destroyed. When Lord Brahmä rises after his night, these lower planetary systems are again created. The statement in Bhagavad-gétä that persons who worship the demigods have lost their intelligence is confirmed in this verse. These less intelligent persons do not know that even if they are promoted to the heavenly planets, at the time of dissolution they themselves, the demigods and all their planets will be annihilated. They have no information that eternal, blissful life can be attained."
