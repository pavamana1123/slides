            "content": "There are three kinds of yoga, namely bhakti-yoga, jïäna-yoga and añöäìga-yoga. Devotees, jïänés and yogés all try to get out of the material entanglement. The jïänés try to detach their sensual activities from material engagement. The jïäna-yogé thinks that matter is false and that Brahman is truth; he tries, therefore, by cultivation of knowledge, to detach the senses from material enjoyment. The añöäìga-yogés also try to control the senses. The devotees, however, try to engage the senses in the service of the Lord. Therefore it appears that the activities of the bhaktas, devotees, are better than those of the jïänés and yogés. The mystic yogés simply try to control the senses by practicing the eight divisions of yoga-yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära, etc.—and the jïänés try by mental reasoning to understand that sense enjoyment is false. But the easiest and most direct process is to engage the senses in the service of the Lord."

            "content": "The purpose of all yoga is to detach one's sense activities from this material world. The final aims, however, are different. Jïänés want to become one with the Brahman effulgence, yogés want to realize Paramätmä, and devotees want to develop Kåñëa consciousness and transcendental loving service to the Lord. That loving service is the perfect stage of sense control. The senses are actually active symptoms of life, and they cannot be stopped. They can be detached only if there is superior engagement. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä, paraà dåñövä nivartate:  the activities of the senses can be stopped if they are given superior engagements. The supreme engagement is engagement of the senses in the service of the Lord. That is the purpose of all yoga."
