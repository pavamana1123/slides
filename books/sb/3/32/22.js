Parameñöhé means \"the supreme person.\" As Brahmä is the supreme person within this universe, Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality in the spiritual world. Lord Kapiladeva advises His mother that she should take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, because it is worthwhile. Taking shelter of demigods, even those in the highest positions, like Brahmä and Çiva, is not advised herein. One should take shelter of the Supreme Godhead."

This is recommended herein by Lord Kapila to His mother. Bhakti is therefore nirguëa, free from all tinges of material qualities. Although the discharge of devotional service appears to be like material activities, it is never saguëa, or contaminated by material qualities. Tad-guëäçrayayä means that Lord Kåñëa's transcendental qualities are so sublime that there is no need to divert one's attention to any other activities. His behavior with the devotees is so exalted that a devotee need not try to divert his attention to any other worship. It is said that the demoniac Pütanä came to kill Kåñëa by poisoning Him, but because Kåñëa was pleased to suck her breast, she was given the same position as His mother. Devotees pray, therefore, that if a demon who wanted to kill Kåñëa gets such an exalted position, why should they go to anyone other than Kåñëa for their worshipful attachment? There are two kinds of religious activities: one for material advancement and the other for spiritual advancement. By taking shelter under the lotus feet of Kåñëa, one is endowed with both kinds of prosperity, material and spiritual. Why then should one go to any demigod?"
