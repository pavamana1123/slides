            "content": "Here the word nivåtti-dharma-niratäù means \"constantly engaging in executing religious activities for detachment.\" There are two kinds of religious performances. One is called pravåtti-dharma, which means the religious activities performed by the gåhamedhés for elevation to higher planets or for economic prosperity, the final aim of which is sense gratification. Every one of us who has come to this material world has the sense of overlordship. This is called pravåtti. But the opposite type of religious performance, which is called nivåtti, is to act for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Engaged in devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness, one has no proprietorship claim, nor is one situated in the false egoism of thinking that he is God or the master. He always thinks himself the servant. That is the process of purifying consciousness. With pure consciousness only can one enter into the kingdom of God. Materialistic persons, in their elevated condition, can enter any one of the planets within this material world, but all are subjected to dissolution over and over again."
