    "synonyms": "evam—thus; paretya—having gone a long distance; bhagavantam—Lord Brahmä; anupraviñöäù—entered; ye—those who; yoginaù—yogés; jita—controlled; marut—the breathing; manasaù—the mind; virägäù—detached; tena—with Lord Brahmä; eva—indeed; säkam—together; amåtam—the embodiment of bliss; puruñam—unto the Personality of Godhead; puräëam—the oldest; brahma pradhänam—the Supreme Brahman; upayänti—they go; agata—not gone; abhimänäù—whose false ego.",
    "translation": "The yogés who become detached from the material world by practice of breathing exercises and control of the mind reach the planet of Brahmä, which is far, far away. After giving up their bodies, they enter into the body of Lord Brahmä, and therefore when Brahmä is liberated and goes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supreme Brahman, such yogés can also enter into the kingdom of God.",

            "content": "By perfecting their yogic practice, yogés can reach the highest planet, Brahmaloka, or Satyaloka, and after giving up their material bodies, they can enter into the body of Lord Brahmä. Because they are not directly devotees of the Lord, they cannot get liberation directly. They have to wait until Brahmä is liberated, and only then, along with Brahmä, are they also liberated. It is clear that as long as a living entity is a worshiper of a particular demigod, his consciousness is absorbed in thoughts of that demigod, and therefore he cannot get direct liberation, or entrance into the kingdom of God, nor can he merge into the impersonal effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such yogés or demigod worshipers are subjected to the chance of taking birth again when there is again creation."
