Brahmä dies at the end of two parärdhas, at which time the entire material universe is dissolved. Persons who are worshipers of Hiraëyagarbha, the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, do not directly approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vaikuëöha. They remain within this universe on Satyaloka or other higher planets until the end of the life of Brahmä. Then, with Brahmä, they are elevated to the spiritual kingdom."

            "content": "The words parasya para-cintakäù mean \"always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\" or being always Kåñëa conscious. When we speak of Kåñëa, this refers to the complete category of viñëu-tattva. Kåñëa includes the three puruña incarnations, namely Mahä-Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, as well as all the incarnations taken together. This is confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä. Rämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan: (BS 5.39) Lord Kåñëa is perpetually situated with His many expansions, such as Räma, Nåsiàha, Vämana, Madhusüdana, Viñëu and Näräyaëa. He exists with all His plenary portions and the portions of His plenary portions, and each of them is as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words parasya para-cintakäù mean those who are fully Kåñëa conscious. Such persons enter directly into the kingdom of God, the Vaikuëöha planets, or, if they are worshipers of the plenary portion Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, they remain within this universe until its dissolution, and after that they enter."
