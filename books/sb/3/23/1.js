            "content": "The specific example of Bhaväné is very significant. Bhaväné means the wife of Bhava, or Lord Çiva. Bhaväné, or Pärvaté, the daughter of the King of the Himalayas, selected Lord Çiva, who appears to be just like a beggar, as her husband. In spite of her being a princess, she undertook all kinds of tribulations to associate with Lord Çiva, who did not even have a house, but was sitting underneath the trees and passing his time in meditation. Although Bhaväné was the daughter of a very great king, she used to serve Lord Çiva just like a poor woman. Similarly, Devahüti was the daughter of an emperor, Sväyambhuva Manu, yet she preferred to accept Kardama Muni as her husband. She served him with great love and affection, and she knew how to please him. Therefore, she is designated here as sädhvé, which means \"a chaste, faithful wife.\" Her rare example is the ideal of Vedic civilization. Every woman is expected to be as good and chaste as Devahüti or Bhaväné. Today in Hindu society, unmarried girls are still taught to worship Lord Çiva with the idea that they may get husbands like him. Lord Çiva is the ideal husband, not in the sense of riches or sense gratification, but because he is the greatest of all devotees. Vaiñëavänäà yathä çambhuù: Çambhu, or Lord Çiva, is the ideal Vaiñëava. He constantly meditates upon Lord Räma and chants Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Lord Çiva has a Vaiñëava sampradäya, which is called the Viñëu Svämé-sampradäya. Unmarried girls worship Lord Çiva so that they can expect a husband who is as good a Vaiñëava as he. The girls are not taught to select a husband who is very rich or very opulent for material sense gratification; rather, if a girl is fortunate enough to get a husband as good as Lord Çiva in devotional service, then her life becomes perfect. The wife is dependent on the husband, and if the husband is a Vaiñëava, then naturally she shares the devotional service of the husband because she renders him service. This reciprocation of service and love between husband and wife is the ideal of a householder's life."
