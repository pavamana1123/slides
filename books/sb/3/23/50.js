When a woman scratches the ground with her foot, it is a sign that her mind is very disturbed. These signs were sometimes exhibited by the gopés before Kåñëa. When the gopés came in the dead of night and Kåñëa asked them to return to their homes, the gopés also scratched the ground like this because their minds were very disturbed."
