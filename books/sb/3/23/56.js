Any work one performs that does not lead to the state of religious life is useless activity. Everyone is by nature inclined to some sort of work, and when that work leads one to religious life and religious life leads one to renunciation and renunciation leads one to devotional service, one attains the perfection of work. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, any work that does not lead ultimately to the standard of devotional service is a cause of bondage in the material world. Yajïärthät karmaëo 'nyatra loko 'yaà karma-bandhanaù ). Unless one is gradually elevated to the position of devotional service, beginning from his natural activity, he is to be considered a dead body. Work which does not lead one to the understanding of Kåñëa consciousness is considered useless."
