In other places, such as Prayäga, they take baths in the River Ganges. The words tértham äçiñäà yäpakam refer to the fulfillment of desires by bathing in a place of pilgrimage. Kardama Muni advised his good wife to bathe in Lake Bindu-sarovara so that she could revive the former beauty and luster of her body."
