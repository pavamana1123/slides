            "content": "The words yair äçritas tértha-padaç caraëaù are significant here. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as tértha-päda. The Ganges is called a sacred river because it emanates from the toe of Viñëu. The Ganges is meant to eradicate all the material distresses of the conditioned souls. For any living entity, therefore, who has taken shelter of the holy lotus feet of the Lord, nothing is impossible. Kardama Muni is special not because he was a great mystic, but because he was a great devotee. Therefore it is said here that for a great devotee like Kardama Muni, nothing is impossible. Although yogés can perform wonderful feats, as Kardama has already displayed, Kardama was more than a yogé because he was a great devotee of the Lord; therefore he was more glorious than an ordinary yogé. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä, \"Out of the many yogés, he who is a devotee of the Lord is first class.\" For a person like Kardama Muni there is no question of being conditioned; he was already a liberated soul and better than the demigods, who are also conditioned. Although he was enjoying with his wife and many other women, he was above material, conditional life. Therefore the word vyasanätyayaù is used to indicate that he was beyond the position of a conditioned soul. He was transcendental to all material limitations."
