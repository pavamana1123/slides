Those who take the license of married life for sense enjoyment must also take the responsibility to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, and the first stepping-stone is the varëäçrama-dharma system. Varëäçrama-dharma is the systematic institution for advancing in worship of Viñëu. However, if one directly engages in the process of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it may not be necessary to undergo the disciplinary system of varëäçrama-dharma. The other sons of Brahmä, the Kumäras, directly engaged in devotional service, and thus they had no need to execute the principles of varëäçrama-dharma."
