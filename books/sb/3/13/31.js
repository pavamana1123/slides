            "content": "According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the Vedic literatures describe the incarnation of Lord Varäha (Boar) in two different devastations, namely the Cäkñuña devastation and the Sväyambhuva devastation. This particular appearance of the boar incarnation actually took place in the Sväyambhuva devastation, when all planets other than the higher ones—Jana, Mahar and Satya—merged in the water of devastation. This particular incarnation of the boar was seen by the inhabitants of the planets mentioned above. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté suggests that the sage Maitreya amalgamated both the boar incarnations in different devastations and summarized them in his description to Vidura."
