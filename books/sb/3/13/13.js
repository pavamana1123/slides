    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Janärdana [Lord Kåñëa], is the form to accept all the results of sacrifice. If He is not satisfied, then one's labor for advancement is futile. He is the ultimate Self, and therefore one who does not satisfy Him certainly neglects his own interests.",

Brahmä knows how to satisfy the Lord, and similarly persons engaged in the line of Brahmä's plan of activities also know how to satisfy the Lord. The Lord is satisfied by the process of devotional service, consisting of the ninefold process of hearing, chanting, etc. It is in one's own self-interest to execute prescribed devotional service, and anyone who neglects this process neglects his own self-interest. Everyone wants to satisfy his senses, but above the senses is the mind, above the mind is the intelligence, above the intelligence is the individual self, and above the individual self is the Superself. Above even the Superself is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, viñëu-tattva. The primeval Lord and the cause of all causes is Çré Kåñëa. The complete process of perfectional service is to render service for the satisfaction of the transcendental senses of Lord Kåñëa, who is known as Janärdana."
