Hiraëyakaçipu was himself very powerful, and he made his younger brother, Hiraëyäkña, powerful to assist him in fighting with everyone and lording it over material nature as long as possible. If possible, he wanted to rule the universe eternally. These are demonstrations of the spirit of the demoniac living entity."
