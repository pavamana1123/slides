    "translation": "His mental and bodily strength as well as the boon conferred upon him had made him proud. He feared death at the hands of no one, and there was no checking him. The gods, therefore, were seized with fear at his very sight, and they hid themselves even as snakes hide themselves for fear of Garuòa.",

Hiraëyäkña and Hiraëyakaçipu, having received the boon that they would not be killed by any other living entity within this universe, were almost immortal, and thus they were completely fearless."
