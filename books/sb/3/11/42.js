He is a plenary portion of Lord Çré Kåñëa, and thus although He is nondifferent from Lord Kåñëa, His formal appearance in the material world as an incarnation is temporary. The original form of the Personality of Godhead is actually the svarüpa, or real form, and He eternally resides in the Vaikuëöha world (Viñëuloka). The word mahätmanaù is used here to indicate Mahä-Viñëu, and His real manifestation is Lord Kåñëa, who is called parama, as confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä:"
