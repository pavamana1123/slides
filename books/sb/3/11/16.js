The planets of highly learned living entities like the sages Sanaka and Bhågu are not affected by the dissolutions of the millenniums. All the planets are of different types, and each is controlled by a different käla-cakra, or schedule of eternal time. The time of the earth planet is not applicable to other, more elevated planets. Therefore, Vidura herein inquires about the duration of life on other planets."
