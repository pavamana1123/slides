Similarly, the devotees of the Lord can see everything clearly that is in the revealed scriptures. The devotees of Lord Çré Kåñëa can very easily understand the science of Kåñëa, as well as the situation of the material and spiritual creations, without difficulty. Devotees do not have to endeavor for any yoga-siddhi, or perfection in mystic powers. They are competent to understand everything by the grace of the Lord, who is sitting in everyone's heart."
