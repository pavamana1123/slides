There are some scholars who think these kalpas to be one and the same. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, the Brähma-kalpa in the beginning of the first half appears to be the Pädma-kalpa. We can, however, simply abide by the text and understand that the present millennium is in the second half of the duration of the life of Brahmä."
