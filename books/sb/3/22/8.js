Generally a pure devotee of the Lord or a pure disciple of a bona fide spiritual master does not ask any favor either from the Lord or the spiritual master, but even if there is a need to ask a favor from the spiritual master, one cannot ask that favor without satisfying him fully. Sväyambhuva Manu wanted to disclose his mind regarding the function he wanted to execute due to affection for his daughter."
