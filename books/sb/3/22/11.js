            "content": "The words gåhamedhiñu karmasu mean \"in household duties.\" Another word is also used here: sarvätmanänurüpäm. The purport is that a wife should not only be equal to her husband in age, character and qualities, but must be helpful to him in his household duties. The household duty of a man is not to satisfy his sense gratification, but to remain with a wife and children and at the same time attain advancement in spiritual life. One who does not do so is not a householder but a gåhamedhé. Two words are used in Sanskrit literature; one is gåhastha, and the other is gåhamedhé. The difference between gåhamedhé and gåhastha is that gåhastha is also an äçrama, or spiritual order, but if one simply satisfies his senses as a householder, then he is a gåhamedhé. For a gåhamedhé, to accept a wife means to satisfy the senses, but for a gåhastha a qualified wife is an assistant in every respect for advancement in spiritual activities. It is the duty of the wife to take charge of household affairs and not to compete with the husband. A wife is meant to help, but she cannot help her husband unless he is completely equal to her in age, character and quality."
