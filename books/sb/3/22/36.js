These destinations are sometimes described as the awakened, dreaming and unconscious stages. In Bhagavad-gétä the three destinations are described as the destinations of persons in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. It is stated in the Gétä that those who are in the mode of goodness are promoted to better living conditions in higher planets, and those who are in the mode of passion remain within this material world on the earth or on heavenly planets, but those who are in the mode of ignorance are degraded to an animal life on planets where life is lower than human. But one who is Kåñëa conscious is above these three modes of material nature. It is stated in Bhagavad-gétä that anyone who engages in devotional service to the Lord automatically becomes transcendental to the three destinations of material nature and is situated in the brahma-bhüta , or self-realized, stage. Although Sväyambhuva Manu, the ruler of this material world, appeared to be absorbed in material happiness, he was neither in the mode of goodness nor in the modes of passion or ignorance, but in the transcendental stage."

            "content": "Therefore, one who fully engages in devotional service is always liberated. Bilvamaìgala Öhäkura, a great devotee of the Lord, stated: \"If I have unflinching devotion to the lotus feet of Kåñëa, then Mother Liberation is always engaged in my service. The complete perfection of material enjoyment, religion and economic development is at my command.\" People are after dharma, artha, käma and mokña. Generally they perform religious activities to achieve some material gain, and they engage in material activity for sense gratification. After being frustrated in material sense gratification, one wants to be liberated and become one with the Absolute Truth. These four principles form the transcendental path for the less intelligent. Those who are actually intelligent engage in Kåñëa consciousness, not caring for these four principles of the transcendental method. They at once elevate themselves to the transcendental platform which is above liberation. Liberation is not a very great achievement for a devotee, to say nothing of the results of ritualistic performances in religion, economic development or the materialistic life of sense gratification. Devotees do not care for these. They are situated always on the transcendental platform of the brahma-bhüta  stage of self-realization."
