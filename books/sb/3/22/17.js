            "content": "It is understood that not only at the present moment but in those days also there were skyscrapers. Herein we find the word harmya-påñöhe. Harmya means \"a very big palatial building.\" Sväd vimänät means \"from his own airplane.\" It is suggested that private airplanes or helicopters were also current in those days. The Gandharva Viçvävasu, while flying in the sky, could see Devahüti playing ball on the roof of the palace. Ball playing was also current, but aristocratic girls would not play in a public place. Ball playing and other such pleasures were not meant for ordinary women and girls; only princesses like Devahüti could indulge in such sports. It is described here that she was seen from the flying airplane. This indicates that the palace was very high, otherwise how could one see her from an airplane? The vision was so distinct that the Gandharva Viçvävasu was bewildered by her beauty and by hearing the sound of her ankle bangles, and being captivated by the sound and beauty, he fell down. Kardama Muni mentioned the incident as he had heard it."
