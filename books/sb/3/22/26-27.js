In India there are still many magnificent places for spiritual understanding; there are many åñis and saintly persons living in nice cottages on the banks of the Ganges and Yamunä for purposes of spiritual cultivation. While passing through the åñi-kulas the King and his party were very much satisfied with the beauty of the cottages and hermitages. It is stated here, paçyann äçrama-sampadaù. The great sages had no skyscrapers, but the hermitages were so beautiful that the King was very much pleased at the sight."
