Brähmaëas are supposed to be the head of the social body; if the head is clear and has not gone mad, then everything is in proper position. The Lord is described thus: namo brahmaëya-deväya go-brähmaëa-hitäya ca. The purport of this prayer is that the Lord specifically protects the brähmaëas and the cows, and then He protects all other members of society (jagad-dhitäya). It is His will that universal welfare work depends on the protection of cows and brähmaëas; thus brahminical culture and cow protection are the basic principles for human civilization. Kñatriyas are especially meant to protect the brähmaëas, as is the supreme will of the Lord: go-brähmaëa-hitäya ca. As, within the body, the heart is a very important part, so the brähmaëas are also the important element in human society. The kñatriyas are more like the whole body; even though the whole body is bigger than the heart, the heart is more important."
