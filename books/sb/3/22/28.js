There is a similar description when Kåñëa returned to Dvärakä after the Battle of Kurukñetra. At that time He was received by all classes of citizens at the gate of the city. Formerly, capital cities were surrounded by walls, and there were different gates for regular entrance. Even in Delhi today there are old gates, and some other old cities have such gates where citizens would gather to receive the king. Here also the citizens of Barhiñmaté, the capital of Brahmävarta, the kingdom of Sväyambhuva, came nicely dressed to receive the Emperor with decorations and musical instruments."
