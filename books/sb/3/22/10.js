But she heard about Kardama Muni from the authority of Närada Muni. Hearing from an authority is a better experience than gaining personal understanding. She heard from Närada Muni that Kardama Muni was just fit to be her husband; therefore she became fixed in her heart that she would marry him, and she expressed her desire to her father, who therefore brought her before him."
