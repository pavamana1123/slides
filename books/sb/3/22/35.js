The life of Emperor Sväyambhuva Manu, however, was not tasteless; as he grew older, his life remained as fresh as in the beginning because of his continued Kåñëa consciousness. The life of a man in Kåñëa consciousness is always fresh. It is said that the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening and its business is to reduce the duration of everyone's life. But the sunrise and sunset cannot diminish the life of one who engages in Kåñëa consciousness. Sväyambhuva Manu's life did not become stale after some time, for he engaged himself always in chanting about and meditating upon Lord Viñëu. He was the greatest yogé because he never wasted his time. It is especially mentioned here, viñëoù kurvato bruvataù kathäù. When he talked, he talked only of Kåñëa and Viñëu, the Personality of Godhead; when he heard something, it was about Kåñëa; when he meditated, it was upon Kåñëa and His activities."

One yuga is completed in 4,320,000 years, seventy-one of such yugas is the duration of the life of a Manu, and fourteen such Manus come and go in one day of Brahma. For the entire duration of his life - 4,320,000 x 71 years—Manu engaged in Kåñëa consciousness by chanting, hearing, talking about and meditating upon Kåñëa. Therefore, his life was not wasted, nor did it become stale."
