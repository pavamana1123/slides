A girl becomes beautiful by putting ornaments on her body, but Devahüti was more beautiful than the ornaments; she was considered the ornament of the ornamented beautiful girls. Demigods and Gandharvas were attracted by her beauty. Kardama Muni, although a great sage, was not a denizen of the heavenly planets, but it is mentioned in the previous verse that Viçvävasu, who came from heaven, was also attracted by the beauty of Devahüti. Besides her personal beauty, she was the daughter of Emperor Sväyambhuva and sister of King Uttänapäda. Who could refuse the hand of such a girl?"
