    "translation": "The city of Barhiñmaté, rich in all kinds of wealth, was so called because Lord Viñëu's hair dropped there from His body when He manifested Himself as Lord Boar. As He shook His body, this very hair fell and turned into blades of evergreen kuça grass and käça [another kind of grass used for mats], by means of which the sages worshiped Lord Viñëu after defeating the demons who had interfered with the performance of their sacrifices.",

            "content": "Any place directly connected with the Supreme Lord is called péöha-sthäna. Barhiñmaté, the capital of Sväyambhuva Manu, was exalted not because the city was very rich in wealth and opulence, but because the hairs of Lord Varäha fell at this very spot. These hairs of the Lord later grew as green grass, and the sages used to worship the Lord with that grass after the time when the Lord killed the demon Hiraëyäkña. Yajïa means Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gétä, karma is described as yajïärtha. Yajïärtha-karma means \"work done only for the satisfaction of Viñëu.\" If something is done for sense gratification or any other purpose, it will be binding upon the worker. If one wants to be freed from the reaction of his work, he must perform everything for the satisfaction of Viñëu, or Yajïa. In the capital of Sväyambhuva Manu, Barhiñmaté, these particular functions were being performed by the great sages and saintly persons."
