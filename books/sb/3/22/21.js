    "translation": "Çré Maitreya said: O great warrior Vidura, the sage Kardama said this much only and then became silent, thinking of his worshipable Lord Viñëu, who has a lotus on His navel. As he silently smiled, his face captured the mind of Devahüti, who began to meditate upon the great sage.",

            "content": "It appears that Kardama Muni was fully absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness because as soon as he became silent, he at once began to think of Lord Viñëu. That is the way of Kåñëa consciousness. Pure devotees are so absorbed in thought of Kåñëa that they have no other engagement; although they may seem to think or act otherwise, they are always thinking of Kåñëa. The smile of such a Kåñëa conscious person is so attractive that simply by smiling he wins so many admirers, disciples and followers."
