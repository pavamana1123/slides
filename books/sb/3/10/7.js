All the planets were already generated by the Lord, and all the living entities were also born in Brahmä. The material world and the living entities were all already generated in seedling forms by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Brahmä was to disseminate the same seedlings all over the universe. The real creation is therefore called sarga, and, later on, the manifestation by Brahmä is called visarga."
