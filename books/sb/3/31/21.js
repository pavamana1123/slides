            "content": "The miseries of material existence begin from the very day when the spirit soul takes shelter in the ovum and sperm of the mother and father, they continue after he is born from the womb, and then they are further prolonged. We do not know where the suffering ends. It does not end, however, by one's changing his body. The change of body is taking place at every moment, but that does not mean that we are improving from the fetal condition of life to a more comfortable condition. The best thing is, therefore, to develop Kåñëa consciousness. Here it is stated, upasädita-viñëu-pädaù. This means realization of Kåñëa consciousness. One who is intelligent, by the grace of the Lord, and develops Kåñëa consciousness, is successful in his life because simply by keeping himself in Kåñëa consciousness, he will be saved from the repetition of birth and death."

            "content": "The child prays that it is better to remain within the womb of darkness and be constantly absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness than to get out and again fall a victim to the illusory energy. The illusory energy acts within the abdomen as well as outside the abdomen, but the trick is that one should remain Kåñëa conscious, and then the effect of such a horrible condition cannot act unfavorably upon him. In Bhagavad-gétä it is said that one's intelligence is his friend, and the same intelligence can also be his enemy. Here also the same idea is repeated: suhådätmanaiva, friendly intelligence. Absorption of intelligence in the personal service of Kåñëa and full consciousness of Kåñëa always are the path of self-realization and liberation. Without being unnecessarily agitated, if we take to the process of Kåñëa consciousness by constantly chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, the cycle of birth and death can be stopped for good."

            "content": "It may be questioned herein how the child can be fully Kåñëa conscious within the womb of the mother without any paraphernalia with which to execute Kåñëa consciousness. It is not necessary to arrange for paraphernalia to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu. The child wants to remain within the abdomen of its mother and at the same time wants to become free from the clutches of mäyä. One does not need any material arrangement to cultivate Kåñëa consciousness. One can cultivate Kåñëa consciousness anywhere and everywhere, provided he can always think of Kåñëa. The mahä-mantra, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, can be chanted even within the abdomen of one's mother. One can chant while sleeping, while working, while imprisoned in the womb or while outside. This Kåñëa consciousness cannot be checked in any circumstance. The conclusion of the child's prayer is: \"Let me remain in this condition; although it is very miserable, it is better not to fall a victim to mäyä again by going outside.\""
