It is a question of attachment. A man becomes attached to a woman because of her service, her beauty and many other assets, and similarly a woman becomes attached to a man for his giving her a nice place to live, ornaments, dress and children. It is a question of attachment for one another. As long as either is attached to the other for such material enjoyment, the woman is dangerous for the man, and the man is also dangerous for the woman. But if the attachment is transferred to Kåñëa, both of them become Kåñëa conscious, and then marriage is very nice. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé therefore recommends:"

Since the via medium is Kåñëa, the consciousness is pure, and there is no possibility of degradation at any time."
