And in the Second Chapter of the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, it is also stated that when one becomes freed from material contamination by rendering devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can at that time understand the science of God."

            "content": "Here the word pratilabdhätma-läbhaù occurs. Ätmä means \"self,\" and läbha means \"gain.\" Generally, conditioned souls have lost their ätmä, or self, but those who are transcendentalists have realized the self. It is directed that such a self-realized soul who aspires to the topmost platform of yogic perfection should not associate with young women. In the modern age, however, there are so many rascals who recommend that while one has genitals he should enjoy women as much as he likes, and at the same time he can become a yogé. In no standard yoga system is the association of women accepted. It is clearly stated here that the association of women is the gateway to hellish life. The association of woman is very much restricted in the Vedic civilization. Out of the four social divisions, the brahmacäré, vänaprastha and the sannyäsé—three orders—are strictly prohibited from the association of women; only the gåhasthas, or householders, are given license to have an intimate relationship with a woman, and that relationship is also restricted for begetting nice children. If, however, one wants to stick to continued existence in the material world, he may indulge in female association unrestrictedly."
