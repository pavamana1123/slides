            "content": "Actually, those who are searching after the Absolute Truth must take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worship Him. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa advised Arjuna many times to surrender unto Him, especially at the end of the Ninth Chapter—man-manä bhava mad-bhaktaù: \"If you want to be perfect, just always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your obeisances to Me. In this way you will understand Me, the Personality of Godhead, and ultimately you will come back to Me, back to Godhead, back home.\" Why is it so? The Lord is always full in six opulences, as mentioned herein: wealth, renunciation, fame, knowledge, strength and beauty. The word pürtam means \"in full.\" No one can claim that all wealth belongs to him, but Kåñëa can claim it, since He has full wealth. Similarly, He is full in knowledge, renunciation, strength and beauty. He is full in everything, and no one can surpass Him. Another one of Kåñëa's names is asamordhva, which means that no one is equal to or greater than Him."
