            "content": "As explained in Bhagavad-gétä, Fourth Chapter, anyone who understands the transcendental activities, the appearance and the disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is to be considered liberated. Brahmä, therefore, is a liberated soul. Although he is in charge of this material world, he is not exactly like the common living entity. Since he is liberated from the majority of the follies of the common living entities, he was in knowledge of the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he therefore worshiped the Lord's activities, and with a glad heart he also praised Kardama Muni because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as Kapila, had appeared as his son. One who can become the father of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly a great devotee. There is a verse spoken by a brähmaëa in which he says that he does not know what the Vedas and what the puräëas are, but while others might be interested in the Vedas or puräëas, he is interested in Nanda Mahäräja, who appeared as the father of Kåñëa. The brähmaëa wanted to worship Nanda Mahäräja because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as a child, crawled in the yard of his house. These are some of the good sentiments of devotees. If a recognized devotee brings forth the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his son, how he should be praised! Brahmä, therefore, not only worshiped the incarnation of Godhead Kapila but also praised His so-called father, Kardama Muni."
