            "content": "Here the word avidyä is very significant. Avidyä means forgetfulness of one's identity. Every one of us is a spirit soul, but we have forgotten. We think, \"I am this body.\" This is called avidyä. Saàçaya-granthi means \"doubtfulness.\" The knot of doubtfulness is tied when the soul identifies with the material world. That knot is also called ahaìkära, the junction of matter and spirit. By proper knowledge received from the scriptures in disciplic succession and by proper application of that knowledge, one can free himself from this binding combination of matter and spirit. Brahmä assures Devahüti that her son will enlighten her, and after enlightening her He will travel all over the world, distributing the system of Säìkhya philosophy."

            "content": "The word saàçaya means \"doubtful knowledge.\" Speculative and pseudo yogic knowledge is all doubtful. At the present moment the so-called yoga system is prosecuted on the understanding that by agitation of the different stations of the bodily construction one can find that he is God. The mental speculators think similarly, but they are all doubtful. Real knowledge is expounded in Bhagavad-gétä: \"Just become Kåñëa conscious. Just worship Kåñëa and become a devotee of Kåñëa.\" That is real knowledge, and anyone who follows that system becomes perfect without a doubt."
