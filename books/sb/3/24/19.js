This is the statement of Brahmä, and because we belong to Brahmä's disciplic succession we should accept his statement that the real Kapila is the son of Devahüti and that real Säìkhya philosophy is the system of philosophy which He introduced and which will be accepted by the äcäryas, the directors of spiritual discipline. The word susammata means \"accepted by persons who are counted upon to give their good opinion.\""
