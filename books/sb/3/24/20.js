            "content": "The words haàsena yänena are very significant here. Haàsa-yäna, the airplane by which Brahmä travels all over outer space, resembles a swan. Brahmä is also known as Haàsa because he can grasp the essence of everything. His abode is called tri-dhäma-paramam. There are three divisions of the universe—the upper planetary system, the middle planetary system and the lower planetary system—but his abode is above even Siddhaloka, the upper planetary system. He returned to his own planet with the four Kumäras and Närada because they were not going to be married. The other åñis who came with him, such as Maréci and Atri, remained there because they were to be married to the daughters of Kardama, but his other sons—Sanat, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanätana and Närada—went back with him in his swan-shaped airplane. The four Kumäras and Närada are naiñöhika-brahmacärés. Naiñöhika-brahmacäré refers to one who never wastes his semen at any time. They were not to attend the marriage ceremony of their other brothers, Maréci and the other sages, and therefore they went back with their father, Haàsa."
