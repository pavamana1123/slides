In other words, devotional service to the Lord is so easy that even a householder can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as one of the members of his household, as his son, as Kardama Muni experienced. He was a householder, although a yogé, but he had the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kapila Muni as his son."

            "content": "Devotional service is such a powerful transcendental method that it surpasses all other methods of transcendental realization. The Lord says, therefore, that He lives neither in Vaikuëöha nor in the heart of a yogé, but He lives where His pure devotees are always chanting and glorifying Him. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as bhakta-vatsala. He is never described as jïäné-vatsala or yogé-vatsala. He is always described as bhakta-vatsala because He is more inclined toward His devotees than toward other transcendentalists. In Bhagavad-gétä it is confirmed that only a devotee can understand Him as He is. Bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti:  \"One can understand Me only by devotional service, not otherwise.\" That understanding alone is real because although jïänés, mental speculators, can realize only the effulgence, or the bodily luster, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and yogés can realize only the partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a bhakta not only realizes Him as He is but also associates with the Personality of Godhead face to face."
