Although we can travel in outer space, we are hampered by so many impediments, but they are not. We learn from the pages of Çrémad-Bhägavatam that the inhabitants of the planet called Siddhaloka can travel in space from one planet to another without impediment. They showered flowers on the earth when Lord Kapila, the son of Kardama, appeared."
