A very good example is set here: the husband goes away, taking the sannyäsa order for self-realization, but his representative, the son, who is equally educated, remains at home to deliver the mother. A sannyäsé is not supposed to take his wife with him. At the vänaprastha stage of retired life, or the stage midway between householder life and renounced life, one may keep his wife as an assistant without sex relations, but in the sannyäsa order of life one cannot keep his wife with him. Otherwise, a person like Kardama Muni could have kept his wife with him, and there would have been no hindrance to his prosecution of self-realization."

            "content": "Kardama Muni followed the Vedic injunction that no one in sannyäsa life can have any kind of relationship with women. But what is the position of a woman who is left by her husband? She is entrusted to the son, and the son promises that he will deliver his mother from entanglement. A woman is not supposed to take sannyäsa. So-called spiritual societies concocted in modern times give sannyäsa even to women, although there is no sanction in the Vedic literature for a woman's accepting sannyäsa. Otherwise, if it were sanctioned, Kardama Muni could have taken his wife and given her sannyäsa. The woman must remain at home. She has only three stages of life: dependency on the father in childhood, dependency on the husband in youth and, in old age, dependency on the grown-up son, such as Kapila. In old age the progress of woman depends on the grown-up son. The ideal son, Kapila Muni, is assuring His father of the deliverance of His mother so that His father may go peacefully without anxiety for his good wife."
