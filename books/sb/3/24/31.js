            "content": "In the Brahma-saàhitä it is stated that the Lord is one Absolute, but He has ananta, or innumerable, forms. Advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam (BS 5.33). The Lord is the original form, but still He has multiforms. Those multiforms are manifested by Him transcendentally, according to the tastes of His multidevotees. It is understood that once Hanumän, the great devotee of Lord Rämacandra, said that he knew that Näräyaëa, the husband of Lakñmé, and Räma, the husband of Sétä, are one and the same, and that there is no difference between Lakñmé and Sétä, but as for himself, he liked the form of Lord Räma. In a similar way, some devotees worship the original form of Kåñëa. When we say \"Kåñëa\" we refer to all forms of the Lord—not only Kåñëa, but Räma, Nåsiàha, Varäha, Näräyaëa, etc. The varieties of transcendental forms exist simultaneously. That is also stated in the Brahma-saàhitä: rämädi-mürtiñu. .. nänävatäram. He already exists in multiforms, but none of the forms are material. Çrédhara Svämé has commented that arüpiëaù, \"without form,\" means without material form. The Lord has form, otherwise how can it be stated here, täny eva te 'bhirüpäëi rüpäëi bhagavaàs tava: \"You have Your forms, but they are not material. Materially You have no form, but spiritually, transcendentally, You have multiforms\"? Mäyävädé philosophers cannot understand these transcendental forms of the Lord, and being disappointed, they say that the Supreme Lord is impersonal. But that is not a fact; whenever there is form there is a person. Many times in many Vedic literatures the Lord is described as puruña, which means \"the original form, the original enjoyer.\" The conclusion is that the Lord has no material form, and yet, according to the liking of different grades of devotees, He simultaneously exists in multiforms, such as Räma, Nåsiàha, Varäha, Näräyaëa and Mukunda. There are many thousands and thousands of forms, but they are all viñëu-tattva, Kåñëa."
