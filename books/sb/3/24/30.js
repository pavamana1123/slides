He descended as the son of Kardama Muni in order to fulfill that promise. Another purpose of His appearance is cikérñur bhagavän jïänam, to distribute knowledge. Therefore, He is called bhaktänäà mäna-vardhanaù, \"He who increases the honor of His devotees.\" By distributing Säìkhya He would increase the honor of the devotees; therefore, Säìkhya philosophy is not dry mental speculation. Säìkhya philosophy means devotional service. How could the honor of the devotees be increased unless Säìkhya were meant for devotional service? Devotees are not interested in speculative knowledge; therefore, the Säìkhya enunciated by Kapila Muni is meant to establish one firmly in devotional service. Real knowledge and real liberation is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engage in devotional service."
