The Lord confirms there that in the beginning of creation Brahmä created the Manus, along with the ritualistic sacrificial method, and blessed them: \"Continue these sacrificial rites, and you will be gradually elevated to your proper position of self-realization and will also enjoy material happiness.\" All the living entities created by Brahmä are conditioned souls and are inclined to lord it over material nature. The purpose of sacrificial rituals is to revive, gradually, the spiritual realization of the living entities. That is the beginning of life within this universe. These sacrificial rituals, however, are intended to please the Supreme Lord. Unless one pleases the Supreme Lord, or unless one is Kåñëa conscious, one cannot be happy either in material enjoyment or in spiritual realization."
