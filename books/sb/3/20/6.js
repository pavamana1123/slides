Those who are actually on the transcendental platform are never satiated by hearing the continuous narration of the pastimes of the Lord. For example, if any self-realized soul reads from Bhagavad-gétä, he will never feel satiated. The narrations of Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam may be read thousands and thousands of times, and still, without fail, new aspects of the subject matter will be relished by the devotee."
