For those who are addicted to sense enjoyment, spiritual realization is not possible. In Bhagavad-gétä it is stated that those who are too attached to seeking material possessions and material enjoyment cannot reach yoga-samädhi, absorption in Kåñëa consciousness. Propaganda that one can enjoy this life materially and at the same time spiritually advance is simply bogus. The principles of renunciation are four: (1) to avoid illicit sex life, (2) to avoid meat-eating, (3) to avoid intoxication and (4) to avoid gambling. These four principles are called tapasya, or austerity. To absorb the mind in the Supreme in Kåñëa consciousness is the process of spiritual realization."
