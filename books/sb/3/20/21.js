The ones who said that he should be eaten were called Yakñas, and the ones who said that he should not be protected became Räkñasas, man-eaters. The two, Yakñas and Räkñasas, are the original creation by Brahmä and are represented even until today in the uncivilized men who are scattered all over the universe. They are born of the mode of ignorance, and therefore, because of their behavior, they are called Räkñasas, or man-eaters."
