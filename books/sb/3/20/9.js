Just to know who is our father is beyond our perception. For that, the mother is the authority. Similarly, we have to understand everything beyond our perception from the authority who actually knows. The first avyakta-märga-vit, or authority, is Brahmä, and the next authority in disciplic succession is Närada. Maitreya Åñi belongs to that disciplic succession, so he also is avyakta-märga-vit. Anyone in the bona fide line of disciplic succession is avyakta-märga-vit, a personality who knows that which is beyond ordinary perception."
