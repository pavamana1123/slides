A godly person is full of knowledge, and a demoniac person is full of ignorance. Just as a child is attracted by a beautiful doll, similarly a demon, who is less intelligent and full of ignorance, is attracted by material beauty and an appetite for sex. The godly person knows that this nicely dressed and ornamented attraction of high breasts, high hips, beautiful nose and fair complexion is mäyä. All the beauty a woman can display is only a combination of flesh and blood. Çré Çaìkaräcärya has advised all persons not to be attracted by the interaction of flesh and blood; they should be attracted by the real beauty in spiritual life. The real beauty is Kåñëa and Rädhä. One who is attracted by the beauty of Rädhä and Kåñëa cannot be attracted by the false beauty of this material world. That is the difference between a demon and a godly person or devotee."
