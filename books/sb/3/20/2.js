Çaunaka Åñi here inquires about the topics of the conversation between Maitreya Åñi and Vidura. Vidura's qualification was that he was not only a friend of the Lord but also a great devotee. When Kåñëa tried to stop the war and mitigate the misunderstanding between the cousin-brothers, they refused to accept His counsel; therefore Kñattä, or Vidura, was unsatisfied with them, and he left the palace. As a devotee, Vidura showed by example that anywhere that Kåñëa is not honored is a place unfit for human habitation. A devotee may be tolerant regarding his own interests, but he should not be tolerant when there is misbehavior toward the Lord or the Lord's devotee. Here the word aghavän is very significant, for it indicates that the Kauravas, Dhåtaräñöra's sons, lost the war because of being sinful in disobeying the instructions of Kåñëa."
