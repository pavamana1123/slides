These books are reading matter for the mass of people, and they were compiled with a view to reviving their God consciousness, now forgotten in the conditional life of material existence. The real purpose of such literatures is not so much to present topics of historical references, but to revive the people's sense of God consciousness. For example, Mahäbhärata is the history of the Battle of Kurukñetra, and common people read it because it is full of topics regarding the social, political and economic problems of human society. But factually the most important part of Mahäbhärata is Bhagavad-gétä, which is automatically taught to readers along with the historical narrations of the Battle of Kurukñetra."

            "content": "Vidura explained to Maitreya his position of being fully satiated with the knowledge of mundane social and political topics and having no more interest in them. He was anxious to hear transcendental topics regarding Lord Çré Kåñëa. Because there were insufficient topics directly concerning Kåñëa in the Puräëas, Mahäbhärata, etc., he was not satisfied and wanted to know more about Kåñëa. Kåñëa-kathä, or topics regarding Kåñëa, are transcendental, and there is no satiation in hearing such topics. Bhagavad-gétä is important on account of its being kåñëa-kathä, or speeches delivered by Lord Kåñëa. The story of the Battle of Kurukñetra may be interesting for the mass of people, but to a person like Vidura, who is highly advanced in devotional service, only kåñëa-kathä and that which is dovetailed with kåñëa-kathä is interesting. Vidura wanted to hear of everything from Maitreya, and so he inquired from him, but he desired that all the topics be in relationship with Kåñëa. As fire is never satisfied in its consumption of firewood, so a pure devotee of the Lord never hears enough about Kåñëa. Historical events and other narrations concerning social and political incidents all become transcendental as soon as they are in relationship with Kåñëa. That is the way to transform mundane things into spiritual identity. The whole world can be transformed into Vaikuëöha if all worldly activities are dovetailed with kåñëa-kathä."

Bhagavad-gétä is kåñëa-kathä because it is spoken by Kåñëa, whereas Çrémad-Bhägavatam is kåñëa-kathä because it narrates about Kåñëa. Lord Caitanya advised all His disciples to preach kåñëa-kathä all over the world without discrimination because the transcendental value of kåñëa-kathä can purify one and all from material contamination."
