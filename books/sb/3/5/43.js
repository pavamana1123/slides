            "content": "For the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmic manifestations there are three incarnations: Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara (Lord Çiva). They are the controllers or masters of the three modes of material nature, which cause the phenomenal manifestation. Viñëu is the master of the mode of goodness, Brahmä is the master of the mode of passion, and Maheçvara is the master of the mode of ignorance. There are different kinds of devotees according to the modes of nature. Persons in the mode of goodness worship Lord Viñëu, those in the mode of passion worship Lord Brahmä, and those in the mode of ignorance worship Lord Çiva. All three of these deities are incarnations of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa because He is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. The demigods directly refer to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord and not to the different incarnations. The incarnation of Viñëu in the material world is, however, directly worshiped by the demigods. It is learned from various scriptures that the demigods approach Lord Viñëu in the ocean of milk and submit their grievances whenever there is some difficulty in the administration of universal affairs. Although they are incarnations of the Lord, Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva worship Lord Viñëu, and thus they are also counted amongst the demigods and not as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Persons who worship Lord Viñëu are called demigods, and persons who do not do so are called asuras, or demons. Viñëu always takes the part of the demigods, but Brahmä and Çiva sometimes take the side of the demons; it is not that they become one in interest with them, but sometimes they do something in order to gain control over the demons."
