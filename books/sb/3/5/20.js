            "content": "Mäëòavya Muni was a great sage (cf. ), and Vidura was formerly the controller Yamaräja, who takes charge of the living entities after death. Birth, maintenance and death are three conditional states of the living entities who are within the material world. As the appointed controller after death, Yamaräja once tried Mäëòavya Muni for his childhood profligacy and ordered him to be pierced with a lance. Mäëòavya, being angry at Yamaräja for awarding him undue punishment, cursed him to become a çüdra (member of the less intelligent laborer class). Thus Yamaräja took birth in the womb of the kept wife of Vicitravérya from the semen of Vicitravérya's brother, Vyäsadeva. Vyäsadeva is the son of Satyavaté by the great King Çäntanu, the father of Bhéñmadeva. This mysterious history of Vidura was known to Maitreya Muni because he happened to be a contemporary friend of Vyäsadeva's. In spite of Vidura's birth from the womb of a kept wife, because he had otherwise high parentage and great connection he inherited the highest talent of becoming a great devotee of the Lord. To take birth in such a great family is understood to be an advantage for attaining devotional life. Vidura was given this chance due to his previous greatness."
