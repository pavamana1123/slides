    "translation": "Your friend the great sage Kåñëa-dvaipäyana Vyäsa has already described the transcendental qualities of the Lord in his great work the Mahäbhärata. But the whole idea is to draw the attention of the mass of people to kåñëa-kathä [Bhagavad-gétä] through their strong affinity for hearing mundane topics.",

As stated in Bhägavatam , Çréla Vyäsadeva compiled the Mahäbhärata for the less intelligent class of men, who take more interest in mundane topics than in the philosophy of life. The Vedänta-sütra was compiled for persons already above the mundane topics, who might already have tasted the bitterness of the so-called happiness of mundane affairs. The first aphorism of Vedänta-sütra is athäto brahma jijïäsä, i.e., only when one has finished the business of mundane inquiries in the marketplace of sense gratification can one make relevant inquiries regarding Brahman, the Transcendence. Those persons who are busy with the mundane inquiries which fill the newspapers and other such literatures are classified as stré-çüdra-dvija-bandhus, or women, the laborer class and unworthy sons of the higher classes (brähmaëa, kñatriya and vaiçya). Such less intelligent men cannot understand the purpose of Vedänta-sütra, although they may make a show of studying the sütras in a perverted way. The real purpose of Vedänta-sütra is explained by the author himself in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and anyone trying to understand Vedänta-sütra without reference to Çrémad-Bhägavatam is certainly misguided. Such misguided persons, who are interested in the mundane affairs of philanthropic and altruistic work under the misconception of the body as the self, could better take advantage of the Mahäbhärata, which was specifically compiled by Çréla Vyäsadeva for their benefit. The great author has compiled the Mahäbhärata in such a way that the less intelligent class of men, who are more interested in mundane topics, may read the Mahäbhärata with great relish and in the course of such mundane happiness can also take advantage of Bhagavad-gétä, the preliminary study of Çrémad-Bhägavatam or the Vedänta-sütra. Çréla Vyäsadeva had no interest in writing a history of mundane activities other than to give less intelligent persons a chance for transcendental realization through Bhagavad-gétä. Vidura's reference to the Mahäbhärata indicates that he had heard of the Mahäbhärata from Vyäsadeva, his real father, while he was away from home and was touring the places of pilgrimage."
