            "content": "The whole Vedic philosophy of life is that one should get rid of the material encagement of gross and subtle bodies, which only cause one to continue in a condemned life of miseries. This material body continues as long as one is not detached from the false conception of lording it over material nature. The impetus for lording it over material nature is the sense of \"mine\" and \"I.\" \"I am the lord of all that I survey. So many things I possess, and I shall possess more and more. Who can be richer than I in wealth and education? I am the master, and I am God. Who else is there but me?\" All these ideas reflect the philosophy of ahaà mama, the conception that \"I am everything.\" Persons conducted by such a conception of life can never get liberation from material bondage. But even a person perpetually condemned to the miseries of material existence can get relief from bondage if he simply agrees to hear only kåñëa-kathä. In this age of Kali, the process of hearing kåñëa-kathä is the most effective means to gain release from unwanted family affection and thus find permanent freedom in life. The age of Kali is full of sinful reactions, and people are more and more addicted to the qualities of this age, but simply by hearing and chanting of kåñëa-kathä one is sure to go back to Godhead. Therefore, people should be trained to hear only kåñëa-kathä—by all means—in order to get relief from all miseries."
