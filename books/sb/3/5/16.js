He therefore wanted to hear about Him in His puruña incarnations, which He manifests with full potencies for the creation and maintenance of the cosmic world. The activities of the puruña incarnations are but an extension of the activities of the Lord. This hint was given by Vidura to Maitreya because Maitreya could not decide which part of the activities of Lord Kåñëa should he chanted."
