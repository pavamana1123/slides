One who wants to possess also laments when he loses his possession. Devotees have no hankerings for material possessions and no hankerings for spiritual salvation. They are situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord as a matter of duty, and they do not mind where they are or how they have to act. Karmés, jïänés and yogés all hanker to possess some material or spiritual assets. Karmés want material possessions, jïänés and yogés want spiritual possessions, but devotees do not want any material or spiritual assets. They want only to serve the Lord anywhere in the material or spiritual worlds that the Lord desires, and the Lord is always specifically compassionate towards such devotees."

            "content": "The karmés, jïänés and yogés have their particular mentalities in the modes of nature, and therefore they are called itara or nondevotees. These itaras, including even the yogés, sometimes harass the devotees of the Lord. Durväsä Muni, a great yogé, harassed Mahäräja Ambaréña because the latter was a great devotee of the Lord. And the great karmé and jïäné Hiraëyakaçipu even harassed his own Vaiñëava son, Prahläda Mahäräja. There are many instances of such harassment of the peaceful devotees of the Lord by the itaras. When such friction takes place, the Lord, out of His great compassion towards His pure devotees, appears in person, accompanied by His plenary portions controlling the mahat-tattva."

As electricity is generated by friction of matter anywhere and everywhere, the Lord, being all-pervading, appears because of the friction of devotees and nondevotees. When Lord Kåñëa appears on a mission, all His plenary portions accompany Him. When He appeared as the son of Vasudeva, there were differences of opinion about His incarnation. Some said, \"He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\" Some said, \"He is an incarnation of Näräyaëa,\" and others said, \"He is the incarnation of Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu.\" But actually He is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead—kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam —and Näräyaëa, the puruñas and all other incarnations accompany Him to function as different parts of His pastimes. Mahad-aàça-yuktaù indicates that He is accompanied by the puruñas, who create the mahat-tattva. It is confirmed in the Vedic hymns, mahäntaà vibhum ätmänam."

Vasudeva and Ugrasena were the Lord's devotees, and Kaàsa, a representative of the karmés and jïänés, was a nondevotee. Kåñëa, as He is, is compared to the sun. He first appeared from the ocean of the womb of Devaké, and gradually He satisfied the inhabitants of the places surrounding Mathurä, just as the sun enlivens the lotus flower in the morning. After gradually rising to the meridian of Dvärakä, the Lord set like the sun, placing everything in darkness, as described by Uddhava."
