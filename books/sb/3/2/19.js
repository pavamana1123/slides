He was merciful even to His enemy the King of Cedi, who always tried to be an envious rival of the Lord. Because it is not possible to be a bona fide rival of the Lord, the King of Cedi was extremely malicious toward Lord Kåñëa. In this he was like many other asuras, such as Kaàsa and Jaräsandha. In the open assembly of the räjasüya sacrifice performed by Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, Çiçupäla insulted Lord Kåñëa, and he was finally killed by the Lord. But it was seen by everyone in the assembly that a light flashed out of the body of the King of Cedi and merged into the body of Lord Kåñëa. This means that Cediräja achieved the salvation of attaining oneness with the Supreme, which is a perfection most desired by the jïänés and yogés and for which they execute their different types of transcendental activities."

Both achieve the salvation of merging in the brahmajyoti rays of the transcendental body of the Lord. The Lord was merciful even to His enemy, and the success of the King of Cedi was observed by everyone who was present in the assembly. Vidura was also present there, and therefore Uddhava referred the incident to his memory."
