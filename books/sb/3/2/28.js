            "content": "If anyone wants to enjoy the childhood pastimes of the Lord, then he has to follow in the footsteps of the residents of Vraja like Nanda, Upananda and other parental inhabitants. A child may insist on having something and cry like anything to get it, disturbing the whole neighborhood, and then immediately after achieving the desired thing, he laughs. Such crying and laughing is enjoyable to the parents and elderly members of the family, so the Lord would simultaneously cry and laugh in this way and merge His devotee-parents in the humor of transcendental pleasure. These incidents are enjoyable only by the residents of Vraja like Nanda Mahäräja, and not by the impersonalist worshipers of Brahman or Paramätmä. Sometimes when attacked in the forest by demons, Kåñëa would appear struck with wonder, but He looked on them like the cub of a lion and killed them. His childhood companions would also be struck with wonder, and when they came back home they would narrate the story to their parents, and everyone would appreciate the qualities of their Kåñëa. Child Kåñëa did not belong only to His parents, Nanda and Yaçodä; He was the son of all the elderly inhabitants of Våndävana and the friend of all contemporary boys and girls. Everyone loved Kåñëa. He was the life and soul of everyone, including the animals, the cows and the calves."
