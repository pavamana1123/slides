From natural instinct he used to serve Lord Kåñëa, even in his childhood. He used to play with dolls in the form of Kåñëa, he would serve the dolls by dressing, feeding and worshiping them, and thus he was constantly absorbed in the play of transcendental realization. These are the signs of an eternally liberated soul. An eternally liberated soul is a devotee of the Lord who never forgets Him. Human life is meant for reviving one's eternal relation with the Lord, and all religious injunctions are meant for awakening this dormant instinct of the living entity. The sooner this awakening is brought about, the quicker the mission of human life is fulfilled. In a good family of devotees, the child gets the opportunity to serve the Lord in many ways. A soul who is already advanced in devotional service has the opportunity to take birth in such an enlightened family. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä . Çucénäà çrématäà gehe yoga-bhrañöo 'bhijäyate: even the fallen devotee gets the opportunity to take his birth in the family of a well-situated brähmaëa or in a rich, well-to-do mercantile family. In both these families there is a good opportunity to revive one's sense of God consciousness automatically because particularly in these families the worship of Lord Kåñëa is regularly performed and the child gets the opportunity to imitate the process of worship called arcanä."

Mahäräja Parékñit also used to play with Kåñëa dolls in his childhood. In India the children in good families are still given dolls of the Lord like Räma and Kåñëa, or sometimes the demigods, so that they may develop the aptitude of service to the Lord. By the grace of the Lord we were given the same opportunity by our parents, and the beginning of our life was based on this principle."
