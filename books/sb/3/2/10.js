But when He was present in the world, different classes of men accepted Him differently, and therefore their calculations of the Lord were also different. Generally, persons who had faith in the revealed scriptures accepted the Lord as He is, and all of them merged into great bereavement when the Lord disappeared from the world. In the First Canto we have already discussed the lamentation of Arjuna and Yudhiñöhira, to whom the disappearance of Lord Kåñëa was almost intolerable up to the end of their lives."

            "content": "The Yädavas were only partially cognizant of the Lord, but they are also glorious because they had the opportunity to associate with the Lord, who acted as the head of their family, and they also rendered the Lord intimate service. The Yädavas and other devotees of the Lord are different from those who wrongly calculated Him to be an ordinary human personality. Such persons are certainly bewildered by the illusory energy. They are hellish and are envious of the Supreme Lord. The illusory energy acts very powerfully on them because in spite of their elevated mundane education, such persons are faithless and are infected by the mentality of atheism. They are always very eager to establish that Lord Kåñëa was an ordinary man who was killed by a hunter due to His many impious acts in plotting to kill the sons of Dhåtaräñöra and Jaräsandha, the demoniac kings of the earth. Such persons have no faith in the statement of the Bhagavad-gétä that the Lord is unaffected by the reactions of work: na mäà karmäëi limpanti . According to the atheistic point of view, Lord Kåñëa's family, the Yadu dynasty, was vanquished due to being cursed by the brähmaëas for the sins committed by Kåñëa in killing the sons of Dhåtaräñöra, etc. All these blasphemies do not touch the heart of the devotees of the Lord because they know perfectly well what is what. Their intelligence regarding the Lord is never disturbed. But those who are disturbed by the statements of the asuras are also condemned. That is what Uddhava meant in this verse."
