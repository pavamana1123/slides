            "content": "In the Vedas it is said that the Supreme Lord or the Paramätmä cannot be understood simply by the strength of one's erudition or power of mental speculation: näyam ätmä pravacanena labhyo na medhayä na bahunä çrutena (Kaöha Upaniñad 1.2.23). He can be known only by one who has the mercy of the Lord. The Yädavas were all exceptionally learned and experienced, but in spite of their knowing the Lord as the one who lives in everyone's heart, they could not understand that He is the original Personality of Godhead. This lack of knowledge was not due to their insufficient erudition; it was due to their misfortune. In Våndävana, however, the Lord was not even known as the Paramätmä because the residents of Våndävana were pure unconventional devotees of the Lord and could think of Him only as their object of love. They did not know that He is the Personality of Godhead. The Yadus, or the residents of Dvärakä, however, could know Lord Kåñëa as Väsudeva, or the Supersoul living everywhere, but not as the Supreme Lord. As scholars of the Vedas, they verified the Vedic hymns: eko devaù. .. sarva-bhütädhiväsaù... antaryämé... and våñëénäà para-devatä. ... The Yadus, therefore, accepted Lord Kåñëa as the Supersoul incarnated in their family, and not more than that."
