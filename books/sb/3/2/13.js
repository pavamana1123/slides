    "translation": "All the demigods from the upper, lower and middle universal planetary systems assembled at the altar of the räjasüya sacrifice performed by Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. After seeing the beautiful bodily features of Lord Kåñëa, they all contemplated that He was the ultimate dexterous creation of Brahmä, the creator of human beings.",

The most beautiful object in the material world may be compared to the blue lotus flower or the full moon in the sky, but even the lotus flower and the moon were defeated by the beauty of the bodily features of Lord Kåñëa, and this was certified by the demigods, the most beautiful living creatures in the universe. The demigods thought that Lord Kåñëa, like themselves, was also created by Lord Brahmä, but in fact Brahmä was created by Lord Kåñëa. It was not within the power of Brahmä to create the transcendental beauty of the Supreme Lord. No one is the creator of Kåñëa; rather, He is the creator of everyone. As He says in Bhagavad-gétä , ahaà sarvasya prabhavo mattaù sarvaà pravartate."
