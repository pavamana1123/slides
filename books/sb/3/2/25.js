Vidura inquired indirectly from Uddhava about the incident of the Lord's disappearance by asking him to relate kåñëa-kathä, or topics on the history of Lord Kåñëa. Thus Uddhava began the topics from the very beginning of His appearance as the son of Vasudeva and Devaké in the prison of Kaàsa, the King of the Bhojas, at Mathurä. The Lord has no business in this world, but when He is so requested by devotees like Brahmä, He descends on the earth for the welfare of the entire universe. This is stated in Bhagavad-gétä : pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm/ dharma-saàsthäpanärthäya sambhavämi yuge yuge."
