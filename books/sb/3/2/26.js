            "content": "There was no necessity of the Lord's being dispatched to the house of Nanda Mahäräja out of fear of Kaàsa's determination to kill Him as soon as He appeared. It is the business of the asuras to try to kill the Supreme Personality of Godhead or to prove by all means that there is no God or that Kåñëa is an ordinary human being and not God. Lord Kåñëa is not affected by such determination of men of Kaàsa's class, but in order to play the role of a child He agreed to be carried by His father to the cow pastures of Nanda Mahäräja because Vasudeva was afraid of Kaàsa. Nanda Mahäräja was due to receive Him as his child, and Yaçodämayé was also to enjoy the childhood pastimes of the Lord, and therefore to fulfill everyone's desire, He was carried from Mathurä to Våndävana just after His appearance in the prison house of Kaàsa. He lived there for eleven years and completed all His fascinating pastimes of childhood, boyhood and adolescence with His elder brother, Lord Baladeva, His first expansion. Vasudeva's thought of protecting Kåñëa from the wrath of Kaàsa is part of a transcendental relationship. The Lord enjoys more when someone takes Him as his subordinate son who needs the protection of a father than He does when someone accepts Him as the Supreme Lord. He is the father of everyone, and He protects everyone, but when His devotee takes it for granted that the Lord is to be protected by the devotee's care, it is a transcendental joy for the Lord. Thus when Vasudeva, out of fear of Kaàsa, carried Him to Våndävana, the Lord enjoyed it; otherwise, He had no fear from Kaàsa or anyone else."
