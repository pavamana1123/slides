            "content": "Lord Çré Kåñëa is so mild and merciful, as described in the above verses, and yet He is the Lord of all kinds of threes. He is the Supreme Lord of the three worlds, the three qualities of material nature and the three puruñas (Käraëodakaçäyé, Garbhodakaçäyé and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu). There are innumerable universes, and in each and every universe there are different manifestations of Brahmä, Viñëu and Rudra. Besides that, there is the Çeña-mürti who bears all the universes on His hoods. And Lord Kåñëa is the Lord of all of them. As the incarnation of Manu, He is the original source of all Manus in innumerable universes. Each universe has manifestations of 504,000 Manus. He is the Lord of the three principal potencies, namely cit-çakti, mäyä-çakti and taöastha-çakti, and He is the complete master of six kinds of fortune—wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation. There is none who can excel Him in any matter of enjoyment, and certainly there is no one greater than Him. No one is equal to or greater than Him. It is the duty of everyone, whoever and wherever one may be, to surrender completely unto Him. It is not wonderful, therefore, that all the transcendental controllers surrender to Him and make all offerings of worship."
