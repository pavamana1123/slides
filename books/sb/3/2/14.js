            "content": "In His boyhood at Våndävana, Lord Kåñëa was notorious as a teasing friend in transcendental love to all the girls His age. His love for them was so intense that there is no comparison to that ecstasy, and the damsels of Vraja were so much attached to Him that their affection excelled that of the great demigods like Brahmä and Çiva. Lord Kåñëa finally admitted His defeat before the transcendental affection of the gopés and declared that He was unable to repay them for their unalloyed affection. Although the gopés were seemingly anguished by the Lord's teasing behavior, when Kåñëa would leave them they could not tolerate the separation and used to follow Him with their eyes and minds. They were so stunned by the situation that they could not finish their household duties. No one could excel Him even in the dealing of love exchanged between boys and girls. It is said in the revealed scriptures that Lord Kåñëa personally never goes beyond the boundary of Våndävana. He remains there eternally because of the transcendental love of the inhabitants. Thus even though He is not visible at present, He is not away from Våndävana for a moment."
