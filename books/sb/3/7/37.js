The associates of the Lord are far more numerous than the living entities who have forgotten the Lord due to material association. The impersonalist's explanation of the word aham in the four verses of the original Bhägavatam—aham eväsam evägre etc.—is refuted here. The Lord and His eternal associates remain after the dissolution. Vidura's inquiry about such persons is a clear indication of the existence of all the paraphernalia of the Lord. This is also confirmed in the Käçé-khaëòa, as quoted by both Jéva Gosvämé and Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, who follow in the footsteps of Çréla Çrédhara Svämé."
