Sometimes tantram is misunderstood to be the black spiritual science of materialistic persons engaged in sense gratification, but here tantram means the science of devotional service compiled by Çréla Närada Muni. One can take advantage of such regulative explanations of the path of devotional service and make progressive advancement in the devotional service of the Lord. Säìkhya philosophy is the basic principle of acquiring knowledge, as will be explained by the sage Maitreya. The Säìkhya philosophy enunciated by Kapiladeva, the son of Devahüti, is the real source of knowledge about the Supreme Truth. Knowledge not based on the Säìkhya philosophy is mental speculation and can yield no tangible profit."
