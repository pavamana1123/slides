The higher planets like the moon and Venus have time measurements different from those of the earth. It is said that six months of this planet earth equal one day of the higher planets. In Bhagavad-gétä the duration of one day in years multiplied by 1,000. And the month and year in Brahmaloka are calculated in that measure."
