This land is sacred because Lord Kåñëa traveled through it many times. From the very beginning of His appearance, He was at Mathurä in the house of His maternal uncle Kaàsa, and He was reared by His foster father Mahäräja Nanda at Våndävana. There are still many devotees of the Lord lingering there in ecstasy in search of Kåñëa and His childhood associates, the gopés. It is not that such devotees meet Kåñëa face to face in that tract of land, but a devotee's eagerly searching after Kåñëa is as good as his seeing Him personally. How this is so cannot be explained, but it is factually realized by those who are pure devotees of the Lord. Philosophically, one can understand that Lord Kåñëa and His remembrance are on the absolute plane and that the very idea of searching for Him at Våndävana in pure God consciousness gives more pleasure to the devotee than seeing Him face to face. Such devotees of the Lord see Him face to face at every moment, as confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38):"
