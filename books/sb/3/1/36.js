    "translation": "Also let me inquire whether Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira is now maintaining the kingdom according to religious principles and with respect for the path of religion. Formerly Duryodhana was burning with envy because Yudhiñöhira was being protected by the arms of Kåñëa and Arjuna as if they were his own arms.",

When he was ruling his kingdom with the help of Lord Kåñëa and Arjuna, the opulence of his kingdom surpassed all imaginations of the opulence of the kingdom of heaven. His actual arms were Lord Kåñëa and Arjuna, and thus he surpassed everyone's opulence. Duryodhana, being envious of this opulence, planned so many schemes to put Yudhiñöhira into difficulty, and at last the Battle of Kurukñetra was brought about. After the Battle of Kurukñetra, Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was again able to rule his legitimate kingdom, and he reinstated the principles of honor and respect for religion. That is the beauty of a kingdom ruled by a pious king like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira."
