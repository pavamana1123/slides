The first thing he said was that Lord Kåñëa was intimately related with them as their cousin. Because Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is worshipable by all brähmaëas and demigods, who are the controllers of the universal affairs. Besides that, Lord Kåñëa and His family members, the royal order of the Yadu dynasty, were the conquerors of all kings of the world."

            "content": "The kñatriyas used to fight the kings of various dominions and kidnap their beautiful princess-daughters, after conquering their relatives. This system was laudable because the kñatriyas and the princesses would be married only on the basis of the chivalry of the conquering kñatriya. All the young princes of the Yadu dynasty married the daughters of other kings in this way, by chivalrous force, and thus they were conquerors of all the kings of the world. Vidura wanted to impress upon his elder brother that fighting with the Päëòavas was fraught with many dangers because they were supported by Lord Kåñëa, who had conquered, even in His childhood, demons like Kaàsa and Jaräsandha and demigods like Brahmä and Indra. Therefore all universal power was behind the Päëòavas."
