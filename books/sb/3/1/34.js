            "content": "Adi-caturbhuja, the original expansions from Baladeva, are Väsudeva, Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. All of Them are viñëu-tattvas, or nondifferent Personalities of Godhead. In the incarnation of Çré Räma, all these different expansions appeared for particular pastimes. Lord Räma is the original Väsudeva, and His brothers were Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Aniruddha is also the cause of Mahä-Viñëu, from whose breathing the Åg Veda appeared. All this is nicely explained in the Märkaëòeya Puräëa. In the incarnation of Lord Kåñëa, Aniruddha appeared as the son of the Lord. Lord Kåñëa in Dvärakä is the Väsudeva expansion of the original group. The original Lord Kåñëa never leaves Goloka Våndävana. All the plenary expansions are one and the same viñëu-tattva, and there is no difference in Their potency."
