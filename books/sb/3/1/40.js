This system was very common in India because all the wives were chaste and faithful to their husbands. Later on, with the advent of the age of Kali, the wives gradually began to be less adherent to their husbands, and the voluntary embrace of the fire by the widows became a thing of the past. Very recently the system was abolished, since the voluntary system had become a forcible social custom."

            "content": "When Mahäräja Päëòu died, both his wives, namely Kunté and Mädré, were prepared to embrace the fire, but Mädré requested Kunté to live for the sake of the younger children, the five Päëòavas. This was agreed upon by Kunté at the added request of Vyäsadeva. In spite of her great bereavement, Kunté decided to live, not to enjoy life in the absence of her husband, but only to give protection to the children. This incident is referred to here by Vidura because he knew all the facts about his sister-in-law Kuntédevé. It is understood that Mahäräja Päëòu was a great warrior and that he alone, with the help of bow and arrow, could conquer the world's four directions. In the absence of such a husband, it was almost impossible for Kunté to live on even as a widow, but she had to do it for the sake of the five children."
