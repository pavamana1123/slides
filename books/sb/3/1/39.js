    "translation": "Are the twin brothers who are protected by their brothers doing well? Just as the eye is always protected by the eyelid, they are protected by the sons of Påthä, who snatched back their rightful kingdom from the hands of their enemy Duryodhana, just as Garuòa snatched nectar from the mouth of Indra, the thunderbolt carrier.",

Similarly, Duryodhana was as strong as the King of heaven, and still the sons of Påthä, the Päëòavas, were able to snatch away their kingdom from Duryodhana. Both Garuòa and the Pärthas are pet devotees of the Lord, and thus it was possible for them to face such strong enemies."

            "content": "Vidura's inquiry was about the youngest brothers of the Päëòavas, namely Nakula and Sahadeva. These twin brothers were sons of Mädré, the stepmother of the other Päëòavas. But although they were stepbrothers, because Kunté took charge of them after the departure of Mädré with her husband Mahäräja Päëòu, Nakula and Sahadeva were as good as the other three Päëòavas, Yudhiñöhira, Bhéma and Arjuna. The five brothers are known in the world as regular brothers. The three elder Päëòavas took care of the younger brothers, just as the eyelid takes care of the eye. Vidura was anxious to know whether, after winning back their own kingdom from the hands of Duryodhana, the younger brothers were still living happily under the care of the elder brothers."
