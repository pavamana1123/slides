    "translation": "By his piety, Vidura achieved the advantages of the pious Kauravas. After leaving Hastinäpura, he took shelter of many places of pilgrimages, which are the Lord's lotus feet. With a desire to gain a high order of pious life, he traveled to holy places where thousands of transcendental forms of the Lord are situated.",

To have high parentage, to possess wealth, to be highly learned and to have great personal beauty are all due to past pious acts. But such pious possessions are not sufficient for obtaining the grace of the Lord and being engaged in His transcendental loving service. Vidura considered himself less pious, and therefore he decided to travel to all the great places of pilgrimage in the world in order to achieve greater piety and advance nearer to the Lord. At that time, Lord Kåñëa was personally present in the world, and Vidura could have at once approached Him directly, but he did not do so because he was not sufficiently freed from sin. One cannot be one hundred percent devoted to the Lord unless and until he is completely free from all effects of sin. Vidura was conscious that by the association of the diplomatic Dhåtaräñöra and Duryodhana he had lost his piety and was therefore not fit to associate at once with the Lord. In Bhagavad-gétä  this is confirmed in the following verse:"

Only those who are pure devotees, those who follow the regulative principles of religious life as prescribed in the scriptures, are able to engage themselves in karma-yoga and then jïäna-yoga and thereafter, by pure meditation, can understand pure consciousness. When God consciousness is developed, one can take advantage of the association of pure devotees.

He cannot be seen with our present eyes, nor can He be heard with our present ears. To the degree that we have entered into the service of the Lord or to the proportion to which our lives are freed from sins, we can perceive the Lord. But even though we are not free from sins, the Lord is kind enough to allow us the facility of seeing Him in His arcä-mürtis in the temple. The Lord is all-powerful, and therefore He is able to accept our service by presentation of His arcä form. No one, therefore, should foolishly think the arcä in the temple to be an idol. Such an arcä-mürti is not an idol but the Lord Himself, and to the proportion to which one is free from sins, he is able to know the significance of the arcä-mürti. The guidance of a pure devotee is therefore always required."

Some of the arcä representations of the Lord situated in different places of pilgrimage are mentioned herewith. The Lord is present at Mathurä (the birthplace of Lord Kåñëa) as Adi-keçava; the Lord is present at Puré (Orissa) as Lord Jagannätha (also known as Puruñottama); He is present at Allahabad (Prayäga) as Bindu-mädhava; at Mandara Hill He is present as Madhusüdana. In the Änandäraëya, He is known as Väsudeva, Padmanäbha and Janärdana; at Viñëukäïcé, He is known as Viñëu; and at Mäyäpura, He is known as Hari. There are millions and billions of such arcä forms of the Lord distributed all over the universe. All these arcä-mürtis are summarized in the Caitanya-caritämåta in the following words:"
