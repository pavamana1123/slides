    "translation": "O gentle one, does Sämba fare well? He exactly resembles the son of the Personality of Godhead. In a previous birth he was born as Kärttikeya in the womb of the wife of Lord Çiva, and now he has been born in the womb of Jämbavaté, the most enriched wife of Kåñëa.",

            "content": "Lord Çiva, one of the three qualitative incarnations of the Personality of Godhead, is the plenary expansion of the Lord. Kärttikeya, born of him, is on the level of Pradyumna, another son of Lord Kåñëa. When Lord Çré Kåñëa descends into the material world, all His plenary portions also appear with Him to exhibit different functions of the Lord. But for the pastimes at Våndävana, all functions are performed by the Lord's different plenary expansions. Väsudeva is a plenary expansion of Näräyaëa. When the Lord appeared as Väsudeva before Devaké and Vasudeva, He appeared in His capacity as Näräyaëa. Similarly, all the demigods of the heavenly kingdom appeared as associates of the Lord in the forms of Pradyumna, Sämba, Uddhava, etc. It is learned here that Kämadeva appeared as Pradyumna, Kärttikeya as Sämba, and one of the Vasus as Uddhava. All of them served in their different capacities in order to enrich the pastimes of Kåñëa."
