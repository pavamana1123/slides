    "translation": "What else is there to say about the residential house of the Päëòavas? Çré Kåñëa, the Lord of everything, acted as your minister. He used to enter that house as if it were His own, and He did not take any care of Duryodhana's house.",

            "content": "According to the Gauòéya acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva philosophy, anything which satisfies the senses of the Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, is also Çré Kåñëa. For example, Çré Våndävana-dhäma is nondifferent from Çré Kåñëa (tad-dhäma våndävanam) because at Våndävana the Lord enjoys the transcendental bliss of His internal potency. Similarly, the house of the Päëòavas was also the source of transcendental bliss for the Lord. It is mentioned here that the Lord identified the house with His own Self. Thus the house of the Päëòavas was as good as Våndävana, and Vidura should not have given up that place of transcendental bliss. Therefore the reason for his quitting the house was not exactly family misunderstanding; rather, Vidura took the opportunity to meet Åñi Maitreya and discuss transcendental knowledge. For a saintly person like Vidura, any disturbance due to worldly affairs is insignificant. Such disturbances, however, are sometimes favorable for higher realization, and therefore Vidura took advantage of a family misunderstanding in order to meet Maitreya Åñi."
