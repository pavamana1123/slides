The history of the world cannot give any systematic account for more than three thousand years into the past, but before that the whole world was under the flag and military strength of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, who was the emperor of the world. At present there are hundreds and thousands of flags flapping in the United Nations, but during the time of Vidura there was, by the grace of Ajita, Lord Kåñëa, only one flag. The nations of the world are very eager to again have one state under one flag, but for this they must seek the favor of Lord Kåñëa, who alone can help us become one worldwide nation."
