Saint Vidura was so honorable that his character was looked up to by all respectable persons. But Duryodhana was so foolish that he dared to insult Vidura. This was due to his bad association with Çakuni, his maternal uncle, as well as with his friend Karëa, who always encouraged Duryodhana in his nefarious acts."
