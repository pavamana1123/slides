Vidura was a sincere well-wisher for Dhåtaräñöra, and he had a thought about him in the corner of his heart. He lamented that Dhåtaräñöra could rebel against the sons of his dead brother Päëòu and that he could drive him (Vidura) out of his own house on the dictation of his crooked sons. In spite of these actions, Vidura never became an enemy of Dhåtaräñöra but continued to be his well-wisher, and at the last stage of Dhåtaräñöra's life, it was Vidura only who proved to be his real friend. Such is the behavior of a Vaiñëava like Vidura: he desires all good, even for his enemies."
