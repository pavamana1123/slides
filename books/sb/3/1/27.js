Vasudeva, therefore, was the husband of Vidura's sister, and thus they were brothers-in-law. Vasudeva's sister Kunté was the wife of Päëòu, Vidura's elder brother, and in that sense also, Vasudeva was brother-in-law to Vidura. Kunté was younger than Vasudeva, and it was the duty of the elder brother to treat younger sisters as daughters. Whenever anything was needed by Kunté, it was munificently delivered by Vasudeva, due to his great love for his younger sister. Vasudeva never dissatisfied his wives, and at the same time he supplied the objects desired by his sister. He had special attention for Kunté because she became a widow at an early age. While inquiring about Vasudeva's welfare, Vidura remembered all about him and the family relationship."
