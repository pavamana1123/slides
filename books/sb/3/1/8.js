But just to favor his own sons, headed by Duryodhana, Dhåtaräñöra, Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira's uncle, adopted various unfair means to cheat his nephews of their rightful share of the kingdom. At last the Päëòavas demanded only five villages, one for each of the five brothers, but that was also refused by the usurpers. This incident led to the War of Kurukñetra. The Battle of Kurukñetra, therefore, was induced by the Kurus, and not the Päëòavas."
