    "translation": "Then, due to his great love and feeling, Vidura embraced him [Uddhava], who was a constant companion of Lord Kåñëa and formerly a great student of Båhaspati's. Vidura then asked him for news of the family of Lord Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead.",

            "content": "Vidura was older than Uddhava, like a father, and therefore when the two met, Uddhava bowed down before Vidura, and Vidura embraced him because Uddhava was younger, like a son. Vidura's brother Päëòu was Lord Kåñëa's uncle, and Uddhava was a cousin to Lord Kåñëa. According to social custom, therefore, Vidura was to be respected by Uddhava on the level of his father. Uddhava was a great scholar in logic, and he was known to be a son or disciple of Båhaspati, the greatly learned priest and spiritual master of the demigods. Vidura asked Uddhava about the welfare of his relatives, although he already knew that they were no longer in the world. This inquiry appears to be very queer, but Çréla Jéva Gosvämé states that the news was shocking to Vidura, who therefore inquired again due to great curiosity. Thus his inquiry was psychological and not practical."
