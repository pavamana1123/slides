The son can protect the father's soul when the father is dead by offering sacrifices to please the Supreme Lord, Viñëu. This system is still prevalent in India. After the death of his father, a son goes to offer sacrifices at the lotus feet of Viñëu at Gayä and thus delivers the father's soul if the father is fallen. But if the son is already an enemy of Viñëu, how, in such an inimical mood, can he offer sacrifice unto Lord Viñëu's lotus feet? Lord Kåñëa is directly the Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, and Duryodhana was inimical to Him. He would therefore be unable to protect his father, Dhåtaräñöra, after his death. He himself was to fall down because of his faithlessness towards Viñëu. How, then, could he protect his father? Vidura advised Dhåtaräñöra to get rid of such an unworthy son as Duryodhana as soon as possible if he was at all anxious to see to the good of his family."

A physician may sometimes advise the extrication of such useless eyes from their sockets so that one can be relieved of the constant trouble. Duryodhana was exactly like blind, troubling eyes; he would be a source of great trouble to the family of Dhåtaräñöra, as foreseen by Vidura. Vidura therefore rightly advised his eldest brother to get rid of this source of trouble. Dhåtaräñöra was wrongly maintaining such personified offense under the mistaken impression that Duryodhana was a good son, able to liberate his father."
