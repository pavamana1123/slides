Sväyambhuva Manu was previously ruling, and his history begins from the Varäha age, or the millennium when the Lord appeared as the boar. There are fourteen Manus in one day of the life of Brahmä, and in the life of each Manu there are particular incidents. The Vaivasvata Manu of Bhagavad-gétä is different from Sväyambhuva Manu."
