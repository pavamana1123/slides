            "content": "It is the duty of a responsible king to protect the social and spiritual orders in human society. The spiritual orders are divided into four äçramas-brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa—and the social orders, according to work and qualification, are made up of the brähmaëas, the kñatriyas, the vaiçyas and the çüdras. These social orders, according to the different grades of work and qualification, are described in Bhagavad-gétä. Unfortunately, for want of proper protection by responsible kings, the system of social and spiritual orders has now become a hereditary caste system. But this is not the actual system. Human society means that society which is making progress toward spiritual realization. The most advanced human society was known as ärya; ärya refers to those who are advancing. So the question is, \"Which society is advancing?\" Advancement does not mean creating material \"necessities\" unnecessarily and thus wasting human energy in aggravation over so-called material comforts. Real advancement is advancement toward spiritual realization, and the community which acted toward this end was known as the Äryan civilization. The intelligent men, the brähmaëas, as exemplified by Kardama Muni, were engaged in advancing the spiritual cause, and kñatriyas like Emperor Sväyambhuva used to rule the country and insure that all facilities for spiritual realization were nicely provided. It is the duty of the king to travel all over the country and see that everything is in order. Indian civilization on the basis of the four varëas and äçramas deteriorated because of her dependency on foreigners, or those who did not follow the civilization of varëäçrama. Thus the varëäçrama system has now been degraded into the caste system."

            "content": "The institution of four varëas and four äçramas is confirmed herewith to be bhagavad-racita, which means \"designed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\" In Bhagavad-gétä this is also confirmed: cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöam . The Lord says that the institution of four varëas and four äçramas \"is created by Me.\" Anything created by the Lord cannot be closed or covered. The divisions of varëas and äçramas will continue to exist, either in their original form or in degraded form, but because they are created by the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they cannot be extinguished. They are like the sun, a creation of God, and therefore will remain. Either covered by clouds or in a clear sky, the sun will continue to exist. Similarly, when the varëäçrama system becomes degraded, it appears as a hereditary caste system, but in every society there is an intelligent class of men, a martial class, a mercantile class and a laborer class. When they are regulated for cooperation among communities according to the Vedic principles, then there is peace and spiritual advancement. But when there is hatred and malpractice and mutual mistrust in the caste system, the whole system becomes degraded, and as stated herein, it creates a deplorable state. At the present moment, the entire world is in this deplorable condition because of giving rights to so many interests. This is due to the degradation of the four castes of varëas and äçramas."
