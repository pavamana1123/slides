Garuòa works as the carrier of the Lord; therefore he is considered the transcendental prince of all carriers. With his two wings Garuòa began to vibrate the Säma Veda, which is chanted by great sages to pacify the Lord. The Lord is worshiped by Brahmä, by Lord Çiva, by Garuòa and other demigods with selected poems, and great sages worship Him with the hymns of Vedic literatures, such as the Upaniñads and Säma Veda. These Säma Veda utterances are automatically heard by the devotee when another great devotee of the Lord, Garuòa, flaps his wings."

            "content": "It is clearly stated here that the sage Kardama began to look to the path by which the Lord was being carried to Vaikuëöha. It is thus confirmed that the Lord descends from His abode, Vaikuëöha, in the spiritual sky, and is carried by Garuòa. The path which leads to Vaikuëöha is not worshiped by the ordinary class of transcendentalists. Only those who are already liberated from material bondage can become devotees of the Lord. Those who are not liberated from material bondage cannot understand transcendental devotional service. In Bhagavad-gétä it is clearly stated, yatatäm api siddhänäm  or siddha. Only the siddhas, or persons liberated from material bondage, can become devotees. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä: anyone who is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, or devotional service, is already liberated from the influence of the modes of material nature. Here it is also confirmed that the path of devotional service is worshiped by liberated persons, not the conditioned souls. The conditioned soul cannot understand the devotional service of the Lord. Kardama Muni was a liberated soul who saw the Supreme Lord in person, face to face. There was no doubt that he was liberated, and thus he could see Garuòa carrying the Lord on the way to Vaikuëöha and hear the flapping of his wings vibrating the sound of Hare Kåñëa, the essence of the Säma Veda."
