In this verse the names of Priyavrata and Uttänapäda, sons of Sväyambhuva, are mentioned. They ruled this earth, which is divided into seven islands. These seven islands are still current, as Asia, Europe, Africa, America, Australia and the North and South Poles. There is no chronological history of all the Indian kings in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, but the deeds of the most important kings, such as Priyavrata and Uttänapäda, and many others, like Lord Rämacandra and Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, are recorded because the activities of such pious kings are worth hearing; people may benefit by studying their histories."
