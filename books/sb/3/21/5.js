Brahmä is also known as Prajäpati, as were some of his later sons. Sväyambhuva Manu is also known as Prajäpati, as is Dakña, another son of Brahmä. Sväyambhuva had two daughters, Äküti and Prasüti. The Prajäpati Ruci married Äküti, and Dakña married Prasüti. These couples and their children produced immense numbers of children to populate the entire universe. Vidura's inquiry was, \"How did they beget the population in the beginning?\""
