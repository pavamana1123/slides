But in others' opinion, Brahmävarta is a place in Brahmaloka, where Sväyambhuva ruled. There are many places on the surface of this earth which are also known in the higher planetary systems; we have places on this planet like Våndävana, Dvärakä and Mathurä, but they are also eternally situated in Kåñëaloka. There are many similar names on the surface of the earth, and it may be that in the Boar age Sväyambhuva Manu ruled this planet, as stated here. The word maìgalaù is significant. Maìgala means one who is elevated in every respect in the opulences of religious performances, ruling power, cleanliness and all other good qualities. Vikhyäta means \"celebrated.\" Sväyambhuva Manu was celebrated for all good qualities and opulences."
