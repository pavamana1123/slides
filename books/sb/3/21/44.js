            "content": "Musk deer are not found in every forest, but only in places like Bindu-sarovara. They are always intoxicated by the aroma of musk secreted from their navels. Gavayas, the species of cow mentioned herein, bear a bunch of hair at the end of their tails. This bunch of hair is used in temple worship to fan the Deities. Gavayas are sometimes called camarés, and they are considered very sacred. In India there are still gypsies or forest mercantile people who flourish by trading kastüré, or musk, and the bunches of hair from the camarés. These are always in great demand for the higher classes of Hindu population, and such business still goes on in large cities and villages in India."
