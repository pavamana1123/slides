            "content": "Because the scientific division of four varëas and four äçramas is now being extinguished, the entire world is being governed by unwanted men who have no training in religion, politics or social order, and it is in a very deplorable condition. In the institution of four varëas and four äçramas there are regular training principles for the different classes of men. Just as, in the modern age, there is a necessity for engineers, medical practitioners and electricians, and they are properly trained in different scientific institutions, similarly, in former times, the higher social orders, namely the intelligent class (the brähmaëas), the ruling class (the kñatriyas) and the mercantile class (the vaiçyas), were properly trained. Bhagavad-gétä describes the duties of the brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras. When there is no such training, one simply claims that because he is born in a brähmaëa or kñatriya family, he is therefore a brähmaëa or a kñatriya, even though he performs the duties of a çüdra. Such undue claims to being a higher-caste man make the system of scientific social orders into a caste system, completely degrading the original system. Thus society is now in chaos, and there is neither peace nor prosperity. It is clearly stated herein that unless there is the vigilance of a strong king, impious, unqualified men will claim a certain status in society, and that will make the social order perish."
