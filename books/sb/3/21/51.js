But he offered his obeisances to Sväyambhuva Manu because as Manu, king and emperor, he was the representative of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is always worshipable, regardless of whether one is a brähmaëa, a kñatriya or a çüdra. As the representative of the Supreme Lord, the King deserved respectful obeisances from everyone."
