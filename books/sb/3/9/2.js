            "content": "The three deities Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara (Çiva), the executive heads of the three modes of material nature (passion, goodness and ignorance), are all generated from Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who is described herein by Brahmä. From the Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, many Viñëu incarnations expand at different ages in the duration of the cosmic manifestation. They are expanded only for the transcendental happiness of the pure devotees. The incarnations of Viñëu, who appear at different ages and times, are never to be compared to the conditioned souls. The viñëu-tattvas are not to be compared to deities like Brahmä and Çiva, nor are they on the same level. Anyone who compares them is called a päñaëòé, or infidel. Tamasaù, mentioned herein, is the material nature, and the spiritual nature has a completely separate existence from tamaù. Therefore, spiritual nature is called avabodha-rasa, or avarodha-rasa. Avarodha means \"that which completely nullifies.\" In the Transcendence there is no chance of material contact by any means. Brahmä is the first living being, and therefore he mentions his birth from the lotus flower generated from the abdomen of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu."
