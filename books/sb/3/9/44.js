When the creation awaited Brahmä's activity, Brahmä saw the Lord, and therefore the Lord existed in His personal form before the creation. His eternal form is not created by the attempt of Brahmä, as imagined by less intelligent men. The Personality of Godhead appeared as He is before Brahmä, and He disappeared from him in the same form, which is not materially tinged."
