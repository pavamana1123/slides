As long as their tendency for foolish work remains powerful, all their plans in the struggle for existence will be cut to pieces. I therefore offer my obeisances unto Him who acts as eternal time.",

They are systematically unmindful of the real beneficial work, which is the devotional service of the Lord, technically called the arcanä regulations. The arcanä regulations are directly instructed by the Lord in the Närada-païcarätra and are strictly followed by the intelligent men, who know well that the highest perfectional goal of life is to reach Lord Viñëu, who is the root of the tree called the cosmic manifestation. Also, in the Bhägavatam and in Bhagavad-gétä such regulative activities are clearly mentioned. Foolish people do not know that their self-interest is in realization of Viñëu. The Bhägavatam  says:"

But almost no one is attracted to such arcanä activity. Everyone is more or less attracted by activities which are conditions of rebellion against the Supreme Lord. The systems of jïäna and yoga are also indirectly rebellious acts against the Lord. There is no auspicious activity except arcanä of the Lord. Jïäna and yoga are sometimes accepted within the purview of arcanä when the ultimate aim is Viñëu, and not otherwise. The conclusion is that only the devotees of the Lord are bona fide human beings eligible for salvation. Others are vainly struggling for existence without any actual benefit."
