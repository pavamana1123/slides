He would appreciate how the Lord expanded Himself into all the calves during His childhood at Våndävana, he would know how Yaçodämayé saw all the universes and planetary systems within the mouth of Kåñëa during His playful childhood pastimes, and he would also see that there are many millions of Brahmäs during the appearance of Lord Kåñëa in Brahmä's daytime. But all these manifestations of the Lord, appearing everywhere in His eternal, transcendental forms, cannot be understood by anyone but the pure devotees, who are always engaged in devotional service to the Lord and are fully absorbed in the Lord. The high qualifications of Brahmä are also indicated herein."
