Devotees of the Lord, therefore, offer all respectful obeisances unto the impersonal feature of the Lord. The word räsa is significant herein. The räsa dance is performed by Lord Kåñëa in the company of the cowherd damsels at Våndävana, and the Personality of Godhead Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu is also engaged in räsa enjoyment with His external potency, by which He creates, maintains and dissolves the entire material manifestation. Indirectly, Lord Brahmä offers his respectful obeisances unto Lord Çré Kåñëa, who is factually ever engaged in räsa enjoyment with the gopés, as confirmed in the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad in the following words: parärdhänte so 'budhyata gopa-veço me puruñaù purastäd ävirbabhüva. The distinction between the Lord and the living entity is definitely experienced when there is sufficient intelligence to understand His internal potency, as distinguished from the external potency by which He makes possible the material manifestation."
