    "translation": "The sage Maitreya said: O Vidura, after observing the source of his appearance, namely the Personality of Godhead, Brahmä prayed for His mercy as far as his mind and words would permit him. Thus having prayed, he became silent, as if tired from his activities of penance, knowledge and mental concentration.",

After being created, Brahmä could not ascertain the source of his appearance, but after penance and mental concentration he could see the source of his birth, and thus he became enlightened through his heart. The spiritual master outside and the spiritual master within are both representations of the Lord. Unless one has contact with such bona fide representations, one cannot claim to be a spiritual master. Lord Brahmä had no opportunity to take the help of a spiritual master from outside because at that time Brahmä himself was the only creature in the universe. Therefore, on becoming satisfied by the prayers of Brahmä, the Lord enlightened him about everything from within."
