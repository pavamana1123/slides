    "translation": "The goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, the dust of whose feet is worn on the head by others, waits upon You, as appointed, for she is anxious to secure a place in the abode of the king of bees, who hovers on the fresh wreath of tulasé leaves offered at Your feet by some blessed devotee.",

As the king of bees hovers over the tulasé leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, so Lakñmé, the goddess who is sought by the demigods, brähmaëas, Vaiñëavas and everyone else, always engages in rendering service to the lotus feet of the Lord. The conclusion is that no one can be the benefactor of the Lord; everyone is actually the servant of the servant of the Lord ."
