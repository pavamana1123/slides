    "translation": "Anyone in the entire world, even down to the caëòäla, who lives by cooking and eating the flesh of the dog, is immediately purified if he takes bath in hearing through the ear the glorification of My name, fame, etc. Now you have realized Me without doubt; therefore I will not hesitate to lop off My own arm if its conduct is found hostile to you.",

            "content": "Real purification can take place in human society if its members take to Kåñëa consciousness. This is clearly stated in all Vedic literature. Anyone who takes to Kåñëa consciousness in all sincerity, even if he is not very advanced in good behavior, is purified. A devotee can be recruited from any section of human society, although it is not expected that everyone in all segments of society is well behaved. As stated in this verse and in many places in Bhagavad-gétä, even if one is not born in a brähmaëa family, or even if he is born in a family of caëòälas, if he simply takes to Kåñëa consciousness he is immediately purified. In Bhagavad-gétä, , it is clearly stated that even though a man is not well behaved, if he simply takes to Kåñëa consciousness he is understood to be a saintly person. As long as a person is in this material world he has two different relationships in his dealings with others—one relationship pertains to the body, and the other pertains to the spirit. As far as bodily affairs or social activities are concerned, although a person is purified on the spiritual platform, it is sometimes seen that he acts in terms of his bodily relationships. If a devotee born in the family of a caëòäla (the lowest caste) is sometimes found engaged in his habitual activities, he is not to be considered a caëòäla. In other words, a Vaiñëava should not be evaluated in terms of his body. The çästra states that no one should think the Deity in the temple to be made of wood or stone, and no one should think that a person coming from a lower-caste family who has taken to Kåñëa consciousness is still of the same low caste. These attitudes are forbidden because anyone who takes to Kåñëa consciousness is understood to be fully purified. He is at least engaged in the process of purification, and if he sticks to the principle of Kåñëa consciousness he will very soon be fully purified. The conclusion is that if one takes to Kåñëa consciousness with all seriousness, he is to be understood as already purified, and Kåñëa is ready to give him protection by all means. The Lord assures herein that He is ready to give protection to His devotee even if there is need to cut off part of His own body."
