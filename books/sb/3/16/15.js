The highest opulence in the material world is called pärameñöhya, the opulence of Brahmä. But that material opulence of Brahmä, who lives on the topmost planet within this material world, cannot compare to the opulence of the Supreme Lord because the transcendental opulence in the spiritual world is caused by yogamäyä, whereas the opulence in the material world is caused by mahämäyä."
