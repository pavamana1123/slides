    "translation": "The brähmaëas, the cows and the defenseless creatures are My own body. Those whose faculty of judgment has been impaired by their own sin look upon these as distinct from Me. They are just like furious serpents, and they are angrily torn apart by the bills of the vulturelike messengers of Yamaräja, the superintendent of sinful persons.",

            "content": "The defenseless creatures, according to Brahma-saàhitä, are the cows, brähmaëas, women, children and old men. Of these five, the brähmaëas and cows are especially mentioned in this verse because the Lord is always anxious about the benefit of the brähmaëas and the cows and is prayed to in this way. The Lord especially instructs, therefore, that no one should be envious of these five, especially the cows and brähmaëas. In some of the Bhägavatam readings, the word duhitṟù is used instead of duhatéù. But in either case, the meaning is the same. Duhatéù means \"cow,\" and duhitṟù can also be used to mean \"cow\" because the cow is supposed to be the daughter of the sun-god. Just as children are taken care of by the parents, women as a class should be taken care of by the father, husband or grown-up son. Those who are helpless must be taken care of by their respective guardians, otherwise the guardians will be subjected to the punishment of Yamaräja, who is appointed by the Lord to supervise the activities of sinful living creatures. The assistants, or messengers, of Yamaräja are likened here to vultures, and those who do not execute their respective duties in protecting their wards are compared to serpents. Vultures deal very seriously with serpents, and similarly the messengers will deal very seriously with neglectful guardians."
