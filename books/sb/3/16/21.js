    "translation": "O Lord, You are exceedingly attached to the activities of Your pure devotees, yet You are never attached to the goddesses of fortune who constantly engage in Your transcendental loving service. How can You be purified, therefore, by the dust of the path traversed by the brähmaëas, and how can You be glorified or made fortunate by the marks of Çrévatsa on Your chest?",

            "content": "It is said in the Brahma-saàhitä that the Lord is always served by many hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune in His Vaikuëöha planet, yet because of His attitude of renunciation of all opulences, He is not attached to any one of them. The Lord has six opulences—unlimited wealth, unlimited fame, unlimited strength, unlimited beauty, unlimited knowledge and unlimited renunciation. All the demigods and other living entities worship Lakñmé, the goddess of fortune, just to get her favor, yet the Lord is never attached to her because He can create an unlimited number of such goddesses for His transcendental service. The goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, is sometimes envious of the tulasé leaves which are placed at the lotus feet of the Lord, for they remain fixed there and do not move, whereas Lakñméjé, although stationed by the chest of the Lord, sometimes has to please other devotees who pray for her favor. Lakñméjé sometimes has to go to satisfy her numerous devotees, but tulasé leaves never forsake their position, and the Lord therefore appreciates the service of the tulasé more than the service of Lakñmé. When the Lord says, therefore, that it is due to the causeless mercy of the brähmaëas that Lakñméjé does not leave Him, we can understand that Lakñméjé is attracted by the opulence of the Lord, not by the brähmaëas' benedictions upon Him. The Lord is not dependent on anyone's mercy for His opulence; He is always self-sufficient. The Lord's statement that His opulence is due to the benediction of the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas is only to teach others that they should offer respect to the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas, the devotees of the Lord."
