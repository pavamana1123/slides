    "translation": "I do not enjoy the oblations offered by the sacrificers in the sacrificial fire, which is one of My own mouths, with the same relish as I do the delicacies overflowing with ghee which are offered to the mouths of the brähmaëas who have dedicated to Me the results of their activities and who are ever satisfied with My prasäda.",

            "content": "The devotee of the Lord, or the Vaiñëava, does not take anything without offering it to the Lord. Since a Vaiñëava dedicates all the results of his activities to the Lord, he does not taste anything eatable which is not first offered to Him. The Lord also relishes giving to the Vaiñëava's mouth all eatables offered to Him. It is clear from this verse that the Lord eats through the sacrificial fire and the brähmaëa's mouth. So many articles—grains, ghee, etc.—are offered in sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Lord. The Lord accepts sacrificial offerings from the brähmaëas and devotees, and elsewhere it is stated that whatever is given for the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas to eat is also accepted by the Lord. But here it is said that He accepts offerings to the mouths of brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas with even greater relish. The best example of this is found in the life of Advaita Prabhu in his dealings with Haridäsa Öhäkura. Even though Haridäsa was born of a Muhammadan family, Advaita Prabhu offered him the first dish of prasäda after the performance of a sacred fire ceremony. Haridäsa Öhäkura informed him that he was born of a Muhammadan family and asked why Advaita Prabhu was offering the first dish to a Muhammadan instead of an elevated brähmaëa. Out of his humbleness, Haridäsa condemned himself a Muhammadan, but Advaita Prabhu, being an experienced devotee, accepted him as a real brähmaëa. Advaita Prabhu asserted that by offering the first dish to Haridäsa Öhäkura, he was getting the result of feeding one hundred thousand brähmaëas. The conclusion is that if one can feed a brähmaëa or Vaiñëava, it is better than performing hundreds of thousands of sacrifices. In this age, therefore, it is recommended that harer näma —chanting the holy name of God—and pleasing the Vaiñëava are the only means to elevate oneself to spiritual life."
