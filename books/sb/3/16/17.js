There are undoubtedly many demigods, the chiefs of whom are Brahmä and Çiva. Lord Viñëu is the Lord of Brahmä and Çiva, not to speak of the brähmaëas in this material world. As mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä, the Supreme Lord is very favorable towards all activities performed according to brahminical culture, or the qualities of control of the senses and mind, cleanliness, forbearance, faith in scripture, and practical and theoretical knowledge. The Lord is the Supersoul of everyone. In Bhagavad-gétä it is said that the Lord is the source of all emanations; thus He is also the source of Brahmä and Çiva."
