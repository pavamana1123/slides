            "content": "The Lord is always in favor of the brähmaëas and the cows, and therefore it is said, go-brähmaëa-hitäya ca. Lord Kåñëa, or Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is also the worshipable Deity of the brähmaëas. In the Vedic literature, in the åg-mantra hymns of the Åg Veda, it is stated that those who are actually brähmaëas always look to the lotus feet of Viñëu: oà tad viñëoù paramaà padaà sadä paçyanti sürayaù. Those who are qualified brähmaëas worship only the Viñëu form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which means Kåñëa, Räma and all Viñëu expansions. A so-called brähmaëa who is born in the family of brähmaëas but performs activities aimed against the Vaiñëavas cannot be accepted as a brähmaëa, because brähmaëa means Vaiñëava and Vaiñëava means brähmaëa. One who has become a devotee of the Lord is also a brähmaëa. The formula is brahma jänätéti brähmaëaù. A brähmaëa is one who has understood Brahman, and a Vaiñëava is one who has understood the Personality of Godhead. Brahman realization is the beginning of realization of the Personality of Godhead. One who understands the Personality of Godhead also knows the impersonal feature of the Supreme, which is Brahman. Therefore one who becomes a Vaiñëava is already a brähmaëa. It should be noted that the glories of the brähmaëa described in this chapter by the Lord Himself refer to His devotee-brähmaëa, or the Vaiñëava. It should never be misunderstood that the so-called brähmaëas who are born in brähmaëa families but have no brahminical qualifications are referred to in this connection."
