In other words, the sages were not actually within Vaikuëöhaloka, but were at the gate. It could be asked, \"How could they return to the material world if they entered Vaikuëöhaloka?\" But factually they did not enter, and therefore they returned. There are many similar incidents where great yogés and brähmaëas, by dint of their yoga practice, have gone from this material world to Vaikuëöhaloka—but they were not meant to stay there. They came back. It is also confirmed here that the Lord was surrounded by many Vaikuëöha airplanes. Vaikuëöhaloka is described here as having splendid opulence, far surpassing the splendor of this material world."

            "content": "All other living creatures, including the demigods, are born of Brahmä, and Brahmä is born of Lord Viñëu. Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä, in the Tenth Chapter, ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù:  Lord Viñëu is the origin of all manifestations in the material world. Those who know that Lord Viñëu is the origin of everything, who are conversant with the process of creation and who understand that Viñëu, or Kåñëa, is the most worshipable object of all living entities, engage themselves in Viñëu worship as Vaiñëavas. The Vedic hymns also confirm this: oà tad viñëoù paramaà padam. The goal of life is to understand Viñëu. The Bhägavatam also confirms this elsewhere. Foolish people, not knowing that Viñëu is the supreme worshipable object, create so many worshipable objects in this material world, and therefore they fall down."
