Leaders of ideal character are therefore needed in society. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared in this material world just to show the example of perfect authority, and people have to follow His path. The Vedic injunction is that one cannot understand the Absolute Truth simply by mental speculation or logical argument. One has to follow the authorities. Mahäjano yena gataù sa panthäù . Great authorities should be followed; otherwise, if we simply depend on the scriptures, we are sometimes misled by rascals, or else we cannot understand or follow the different spiritual injunctions. The best path is to follow the authorities. The four brähmaëa-sages stated that Kåñëa is naturally the protector of the cows and brähmaëas: go-brähmaëa-hitäya ca. When Kåñëa was on this planet, He set a practical example. He was a cowherd boy, and He was very respectful to the brähmaëas and devotees."

When there is a fight between two persons, each of them protects the upper part of his body—the head, the arms and the belly. Similarly, for the actual advancement of human civilization, the best part of the social body, namely the brähmaëas, the kñatriyas and vaiçyas (the intelligent class of men, the military class and the mercantile men) should be given special protection. Protection of the laborers should not be neglected, but special protection should be given to the upper orders. Of all classes of men, the brähmaëas and the Vaiñëavas should be given special protection. They should be worshiped. When their protection is performed, it is just like worshiping God. That is not exactly protection; it is a duty. One should worship the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas by offering them all kinds of endowments and sweet words, and if one has no means to offer anything, he must at least use sweet words to pacify them. The Lord personally exhibited this behavior towards the Kumäras."

When there is no protection and special treatment for persons who are devotees of the Lord, who are highly intelligent in spiritual life, then the whole society is lost. The word naìkñyati indicates that such a civilization becomes spoiled and is annihilated. The kind of civilization recommended is called deva-patha, which means the \"royal road of the demigods.\" Demigods are supposed to be fully fixed in devotional service, or Kåñëa consciousness; that is the auspicious path that should be protected. If the authorities or the leaders of society do not give special respect to the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas and do not offer them not only sweet words but all facilities, then the path of progress will be lost to human civilization. The Lord personally wanted to teach this, and therefore He offered so much praise to the Kumäras."
