Ordinarily, there is no possibility that the four sages could be so angry with the doorkeepers, nor could the Supreme Lord neglect His two doorkeepers, nor can one come back from Vaikuëöha after once taking birth there. All these incidents, therefore, were designed by the Lord Himself for the sake of His pastimes in the material world. Thus He plainly says that it was done with His approval. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for inhabitants of Vaikuëöha to come back to this material world simply because of a brahminical curse. The Lord especially blesses the so-called culprits: \"All glories unto you.\" A devotee, once accepted by the Lord, can never fall down. That is the conclusion of this incident."
