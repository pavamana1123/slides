            "content": "Here is clear proof of how a living entity coming originally from Vaikuëöhaloka is encaged in material elements. The living entity takes shelter within the semen of a father, which is injected within the womb of a mother, and with the help of the mother's emulsified ovum the living entity grows a particular type of a body. In this connection it is to be remembered that the mind of Kaçyapa Muni was not in order when he conceived the two sons, Hiraëyäkña and Hiraëyakaçipu. Therefore the semen he discharged was simultaneously extremely powerful and mixed with the quality of anger. It is to be concluded that while conceiving a child one's mind must be very sober and devotional. For this purpose the Garbhädhäna-saàskära is recommended in the Vedic scriptures. If the mind of the father is not sober, the semen discharged will not be very good. Thus the living entity, wrapped in the matter produced from the father and mother, will be demoniac like Hiraëyäkña and Hiraëyakaçipu. The conditions of conception are to be carefully studied. This is a very great science."
