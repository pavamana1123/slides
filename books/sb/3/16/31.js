Çréla Madhva Muni remarks in this connection that by practicing bhakti-yoga one can become free from all sinful reactions. Even a brahma-çäpa, or curse by a brähmaëa, which cannot be overcome by any other means, can be overcome by bhakti-yoga."

            "content": "One can practice bhakti-yoga in many rasas. There are twelve rasas, five primary and seven secondary. The five primary rasas constitute direct bhakti-yoga, but although the seven secondary rasas are indirect, they are also counted within bhakti-yoga if they are used in the service of the Lord. In other words, bhakti-yoga is all-inclusive. If one somehow or other becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes engaged in bhakti-yoga, as described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam , man-manä bhava mad-bhaktaù: \"Always think of Me.\" It doesn't matter which way one thinks; the very thought of the Personality of Godhead is the basic principle of bhakti-yoga."

            "content": "In the material planets there are different grades of sinful activities, of which disrespecting a brähmaëa or a Vaiñëava is the most sinful. Here it is clearly stated that one can overcome even that grave sin simply by thinking of Viñëu, not even favorably but in anger. Thus even if those who are not devotees always think of Viñëu, they become free from all sinful activities. Kåñëa consciousness is the highest form of thought. Lord Viñëu is thought of in this age by chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. From the statements of the Bhägavatam it appears that if one thinks of Kåñëa, even as an enemy, that particular qualification—thinking of Viñëu, or Kåñëa—cleanses one of all sins."
