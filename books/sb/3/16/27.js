In Bhagavad-gétä it is said that in the spiritual world there is no need of sun, moon or electricity. This indicates that all the planets there are self-illuminated, self-sufficient and independent; everything there is complete. Lord Kåñëa says that once one goes to that Vaikuëöha planet, he never returns. The inhabitants of Vaikuëöha never return to the material world, but the incident of Jaya and Vijaya was a different case. They came to the material world for some time, and then they returned to Vaikuëöha."
