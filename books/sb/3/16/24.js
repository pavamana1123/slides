    "translation": "Dear Lord, You never want the auspicious path to be destroyed, for You are the reservoir of all goodness. Just to benefit people in general, You destroy the evil element by Your mighty potency. You are the proprietor of the three creations and the maintainer of the entire universe. Therefore Your potency is not reduced by Your submissive behavior. Rather, by submission You exhibit Your transcendental pastimes.",

            "content": "Lord Kåñëa was never reduced in His position by becoming a cowherd boy or by offering respect to Sudämä Brähmaëa or His other devotees like Nanda Mahäräja, Vasudeva, Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and the Päëòavas' mother, Kunté. Everyone knew that He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, yet His behavior was exemplary. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1); His form is completely spiritual, full of bliss and knowledge, and it is eternal. Because the living entities are His parts and parcels, originally they also belong to the same quality of eternal form as the Lord, but when they come in contact with mäyä, the material potency, due to their forgetfulness their existential constitution is covered. We should try to understand the appearance of Lord Kåñëa in this spirit, as the Kumäras pray to Him. He is eternally a cowherd boy at Våndävana, He is eternally the leader of the Battle of Kurukñetra, and He is eternally the opulent prince of Dvärakä and the lover of the damsels of Våndävana; all His appearances are meaningful because they show His real characteristics to the conditioned souls, who have forgotten their relationship with the Supreme Lord. He does everything for their benefit. The force exhibited in the Battle of Kurukñetra by the desire of Kåñëa and through the agency of Arjuna was also necessary because when people become too irreligious, force is required. Nonviolence in this respect is rascaldom."
