    "translation": "In addition to these nineteen sons mentioned above, there were eighty-one younger ones, all born of Åñabhadeva and Jayanté. According to the order of their father, they became well cultured, well behaved, very pure in their activities and expert in Vedic knowledge and the performance of Vedic rituals. Thus they all became perfectly qualified brähmaëas.",

            "content": "From this verse we have good information of how the castes are qualified according to quality and work. Åñabhadeva, a king, was certainly a kñatriya. He had a hundred sons, and out of these, ten were engaged as kñatriyas and ruled the planet. Nine sons became good preachers of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (mahä-bhägavatas), and this indicates that they were above the position of brähmaëas. The other eighty-one sons became highly qualified brähmaëas. These are some practical examples of how one can become fit for a certain type of activity by qualification, not by birth. All the sons of Mahäräja Åñabhadeva were kñatriyas by birth, but by quality some of them became kñatriyas, and some became brähmaëas. Nine became preachers of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (bhägavata-dharma-darçanäù), which means that they were above the categories of kñatriya and brähmaëa."
