    "translation": "Being an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Åñabhadeva was fully independent because His form was spiritual, eternal and full of transcendental bliss. He eternally had nothing to do with the four principles of material misery [birth, death, old age and disease]. Nor was He materially attached. He was always equipoised, and He saw everyone on the same level. He was unhappy to see others unhappy, and He was the well-wisher of all living entities. Although He was a perfect personality, the Supreme Lord and controller of all, He nonetheless acted as if He were an ordinary conditioned soul. Therefore He strictly followed the principles of varëäçrama-dharma and acted accordingly. In due course of time, the principles of varëäçrama-dharma had become neglected; therefore through His personal characteristics and behavior, He taught the ignorant public how to perform duties within the varëäçrama-dharma. In this way He regulated the general populace in householder life, enabling them to develop religion and economic well-being and to attain reputations, sons and daughters, material pleasure and finally eternal life. By His instructions, He showed how people could remain householders and at the same time become perfect by following the principles of varëäçrama-dharma.",

A civilization that does not know the highest aim of life is no better than an animal society. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam: na te viduù svärtha-gatià hi viñëum ."
