    "translation": "After Näbhi Mahäräja departed for Badarikäçrama, the Supreme Lord, Åñabhadeva, understood that His kingdom was His field of activities. He therefore showed Himself as an example and taught the duties of a householder by first accepting brahmacarya under the direction of spiritual masters. He also went to live at the spiritual masters' place, gurukula. After His education was finished, He gave gifts (guru-dakñiëä) to His spiritual masters and then accepted the life of a householder. He took a wife named Jayanté and begot one hundred sons who were as powerful and qualified as He Himself. His wife Jayanté had been offered to Him by Indra, the King of heaven. Åñabhadeva and Jayanté performed householder life in an exemplary way, carrying out ritualistic activities ordained by the çruti and småti çästra.",

As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm:  the purpose of an incarnation is to liberate His devotees and to stop the demoniac activities of nondevotees. These are the two functions of the Supreme Lord when He incarnates. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has said that in order to preach, one must live a practical life and show people how to do things. Äpani äcari' bhakti çikhäimu sabäre. One cannot teach others unless he behaves the same way himself. Åñabhadeva was an ideal king, and He took His education in the gurukula, although He was already educated because the Supreme Lord is omniscient. Although Åñabhadeva had nothing to learn from gurukula, He went there just to teach the people in general how to take an education from the right source, from Vedic teachers. He then entered householder life and lived according to the principles of Vedic knowledge—çruti and småti. In his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.2.101) Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, quoting the Skanda Puräëa, states:"

Practically applied in life this is worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to the päïcarätrika-vidhi. Every human being must advance his spiritual life and at the end return home, back to Godhead. Mahäräja Åñabhadeva strictly followed all these principles. He remained an ideal gåhastha and taught His sons how to become perfect in spiritual life. These are some examples of how He ruled the earth and completed His mission as an incarnation."
