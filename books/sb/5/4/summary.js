            "content": "In this chapter, Åñabhadeva, the son of Mahäräja Näbhi, begot a hundred sons, and during the reign of those sons the world was very happy in all respects. When Åñabhadeva appeared as the son of Mahäräja Näbhi, He was appreciated by the people as the most exalted and beautiful personality of that age. His poise, influence, strength, enthusiasm, bodily luster and other transcendental qualities were beyond compare. The word åñabha refers to the best, or the supreme. Due to the superexcellent attributes of the son of Mahäräja Näbhi, the King named his son Åñabha, or \"the best.\" His influence was incomparable. Although there was a scarcity of rain, Åñabhadeva did not care for Indra, the King of heaven, who is in charge of supplying rain. Through His own potency, Åñabhadeva sumptuously covered Ajanäbha with ample rain. Upon receiving Åñabhadeva, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as his son, King Näbhi began to raise Him very carefully. After that, he entrusted the ruling power to Him and, retiring from family life, lived at Badarikäçrama completely engaged in the worship of Väsudeva, the Supreme Lord. To follow social customs, Lord Åñabhadeva for a while became a student in the gurukula, and after returning, He followed the orders of His guru and accepted a wife named Jayanté, who had been given to Him by the King of heaven, Indra. He begot a hundred sons in the womb of Jayanté. Of these hundred sons, the eldest was known as Bharata. Since the reign of Mahäräja Bharata, this planet has been called Bhärata-varña. Åñabhadeva's other sons were headed by Kuçävarta, Ilävarta, Brahmävarta, Malaya, Ketu, Bhadrasena, Indraspåk, Vidarbha and Kékaöa. There were also other sons named Kavi, Havi, Antarikña, Prabuddha, Pippaläyana, Avirhotra, Drumila, Camasa and Karabhäjana. Instead of ruling the kingdom, these nine became mendicant preachers of Kåñëa consciousness, following the religious precepts of the Bhägavatam. Their characteristics and activities are described in the Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam during the talks between Vasudeva and Närada at Kurukñetra. To teach the general populace, King Åñabhadeva performed many sacrifices and taught His sons how to rule the citizens."
