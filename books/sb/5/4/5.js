    "translation": "King Näbhi understood that his son, Åñabhadeva, was very popular among the citizens and among government officers and ministers. Understanding the popularity of his son, Mahäräja Näbhi enthroned Him as the emperor of the world to give protection to the general populace in terms of the Vedic religious system. To do this, he entrusted Him into the hands of learned brähmaëas, who would guide Him in administrating the government. Then Mahäräja Näbhi and his wife, Merudevé, went to Badarikäçrama in the Himalaya Mountains, where the King engaged Himself very expertly in austerities and penances with great jubilation. In full samädhi he worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nara-Näräyaëa, who is Kåñëa in His plenary expansion. By doing so, in course of time Mahäräja Näbhi was elevated to the spiritual world known as Vaikuëöha.",

            "content": "When Mahäräja Näbhi saw that his son Åñabhadeva was popular with the general populace and the governmental servants, he chose to install Him on the imperial throne. In addition, he wanted to entrust his son into the hands of the learned brähmaëas. This means that a monarch was supposed to govern strictly according to Vedic principles under the guidance of learned brähmaëas, who could advise Him according to the standard Vedic scriptures like Manu-småti and similar çästras. It is the duty of the king to rule the citizens according to Vedic principles. According to Vedic principles, society is divided into four categories—brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra. Cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù . After dividing society in this way, it is the king's duty to see that everyone executes Vedic principles according to his caste. A brähmaëa must perform the duty of a brähmaëa without cheating the public. It is not that one attains the name of a brähmaëa without the qualifications. It is the king's duty to see that everyone engages in his occupational duty according to Vedic principles. In addition, retirement at the end of life is compulsory. Mahäräja Näbhi, although still a king. retired from family life and went with his wife to a place called Badarikäçrama in the Himalayas, where the Deity Nara-Näräyaëa is worshiped. The words prasanna-nipuëena tapasä indicate that the King accepted all kinds of austerity very expertly and jubilantly. He did not at all mind leaving his comfortable life at home, although he was the emperor. Despite undergoing severe austerities and penances, he felt very pleased at Badarikäçrama, and he did everything there expertly. In this way, being fully absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness (samädhi-yoga). always thinking of Kåñëa, Väsudeva, Mahäräja Näbhi attained success at the end of his life and was promoted to the spiritual world, Vaikuëöhaloka."

            "content": "This is the way of Vedic life. One must stop the process of repeated birth and death and return home, back to Godhead. The words tan-mahimänam aväpa are significant in this regard. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé says that mahimä means liberation in this life. We should act in such a way in this life that after giving up this body, we will become liberated from the bondage of repeated birth and death. This is called jévan-mukti. Çréla Véraräghava Äcärya states that in the Chändogya Upaniñad there are eight symptoms of a jévan-mukta, a person who is already liberated even when living in this body. The first symptom of one so liberated is that he is freed from all sinful activity (apahata-päpa). As long as one is under the clutches of mäyä in the material energy, one has to engage in sinful activity. Bhagavad-gétä describes such people as duñkåtinaù, which indicates that they are always engaged in sinful activity. One who is liberated in this life does not commit any sinful activities. Sinful activity involves illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Another symptom of a liberated person is vijara, which indicates that he is not subjected to the miseries of old age. Another symptom is vimåtyu. A liberated person prepares himself in such a way that he does not take on any more material bodies, which are destined to die. In other words. he does not fall down again to repeat birth and death. Another symptom is viçoka, which indicates that he is callous to material distress and happiness. Another is vijighatsa, which indicates that he no longer desires material enjoyment. Another symptom is apipätä, which means that he has no desire other than to engage in the devotional service of Kåñëa, his dearmost pursuable Lord. A further symptom is satya-käma, which indicates that all his desires are directed to the Supreme Truth, Kåñëa. He does not want anything else. He is satya-saìkalpa. Whatever he desires is fulfilled by the grace of Kåñëa. First of all, he does not desire anything for his material benefit, and secondly if he desires anything at all, he simply desires to serve the Supreme Lord. That desire is fulfilled by the Lord's grace. That is called satya-saìkalpa. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that the word mahimä means returning to the spiritual world, back home, back to Vaikuëöha. Çré Çukadeva says that the word mahimä means that the devotee attains the qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called sadharma, or \"the same quality.\" Just as Kåñëa is never born and never dies, His devotees who return to Godhead never die and never take birth within the material world."
