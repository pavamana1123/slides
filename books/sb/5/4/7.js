They were so powerful that they could bring forth the Supreme Personality of Godhead by their prayers. Thus Mahäräja Näbhi was able to see the Lord face to face. Unless one is a Vaiñëava, he cannot call forth the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord does not accept an invitation unless one is a Vaiñëava. Therefore it is said in Padma Puräëa:"

They were competent in the performance of the Vedic rituals, and over and above this they were Vaiñëavas. Therefore by their spiritual powers they could call on the Supreme Personality of Godhead and enable their disciple, Mahäräja Näbhi, to see the Lord face to face.
