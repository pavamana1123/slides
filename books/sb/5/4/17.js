    "translation": "Lord Åñabhadeva performed all kinds of sacrifices one hundred times according to the instructions of the Vedic literatures. Thus He satisfied Lord Viñëu in every respect. All the rituals were enriched by first-class ingredients. They were executed in holy places according to the proper time by priests who were all young and faithful. In this way Lord Viñëu was worshiped, and the prasäda was offered to all the demigods. Thus the functions and festivals were all successful.",
