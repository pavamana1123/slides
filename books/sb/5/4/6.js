    "translation": "O Mahäräja Parékñit, to glorify Mahäräja Näbhi, the old sages composed two verses. One of them is this: \"Who can attain the perfection of Mahäräja Näbhi? Who can attain his activities? Because of his devotional service, the Supreme Personality of Godhead agreed to become his son.\"",

That is explained in Bhagavad-gétä: yajïärthät karmaëo 'nyatra loko 'yaà karma-bandhanaù ). Activities performed only for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord are pure and are not contaminated by the modes of material nature. All other activities are contaminated by the modes of ignorance and passion, as well as goodness. All material activities meant for satisfying the senses are contaminated, and Mahäräja Näbhi did not perform anything contaminated. He simply executed his transcendental activities even when performing yajïa. Consequently he obtained the Supreme Lord as his son."
