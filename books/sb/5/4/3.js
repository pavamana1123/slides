    "translation": "Indra, the King of heaven, who is very materially opulent, became envious of King Åñabhadeva. Consequently he stopped pouring water on the planet known as Bhärata-varña. At that time the Supreme Lord, Åñabhadeva, the master of all mystic power, understood King Indra's purpose and smiled a little. Then, by His own prowess, through yogamäyä [His internal potency], He profusely poured water upon His own place, which was known as Ajanäbha.",

            "content": "We find the word bhagavän used twice in this verse. Both King Indra and Åñabhadeva, the incarnation of the Supreme Lord, are described as bhagavän. Sometimes Närada and Lord Brahmä are also addressed as bhagavän. The word bhagavän means that one is a very opulent and powerful person like Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva, Närada or Indra. They are all addressed as bhagavän due to their extraordinary opulence. King Åñabhadeva is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord, and therefore He was the original Bhagavän. Consequently He is described herein as yogeçvara, which indicates that He has the most powerful spiritual potency. He is not dependent on King Indra for water. He can supply water Himself, and He did so in this case. In Bhagavad-gétä, it is stated: yajïäd bhavati parjanyaù . Due to the performance of yajïa, clouds of water are manifest in the sky. Clouds and rainfall are under the management of Indra, the heavenly King, but when Indra is neglectful, the Supreme Lord Himself, who is also known as yajïa or yajïa-pati, takes the task upon Himself. Consequently there was sufficient rainfall in the place named Ajanäbha. When yajïa-pati wants to, He can do anything without the help of any subordinate. Therefore the Supreme Lord is known as almighty. In the present age of Kali there will eventually be a great scarcity of water (anävåñöi), for the general populace, due to ignorance and the scarcity of yajïic ingredients, will neglect to perform yajïas. Çrémad-Bhägavatam therefore advises: yajïaiù saìkértana-präyaiù yajanti hi sumedhasaù. After all, yajïa is meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age of Kali. there is great scarcity and ignorance; nonetheless, everyone can perform saìkértana-yajïa. Every family in every society can conduct saìkértana-yajïa at least every evening. In this way there will be no disturbance or scarcity of rain. It is essential for the people in this age to perform the saìkértana-yajïa in order to be materially happy and to advance spiritually."
