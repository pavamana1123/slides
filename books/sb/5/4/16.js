    "translation": "Although Lord Åñabhadeva knew everything about confidential Vedic knowledge, which includes information about all types of occupational duties, He still maintained Himself as a kñatriya and followed the instructions of the brähmaëas as they related to mind control, sense control, tolerance and so forth. Thus He ruled the people according to the system of varëäçrama-dharma, which enjoins that the brähmaëas instruct the kñatriyas and the kñatriyas administer to the state through the vaiçyas and çüdras.",

The brähmaëas would give advice according to the çästras, and all the other castes would follow. The word brahma means \"perfect knowledge of all activities,\" and this knowledge is very confidentially described in the Vedic literatures. Men trained perfectly as brähmaëas should know all Vedic literature, and the benefit derived from this literature should be distributed to the general populace. The general populace should follow the perfect brähmaëa. In this way, one can learn how to control the mind and senses and thus gradually advance to spiritual perfection."
