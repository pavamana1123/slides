            "content": "In this verse the word hådaya indicates the heart, which is also called uraù, the chest. The heart is situated within the chest, and although instrumentally the son is born with the aid of the genitals, he is actually born from within the heart. According to the heart's situation. the semen takes the form of a body. Therefore according to the Vedic system, when one begets a child his heart should be purified through the ritualistic ceremony known as garbhädhäna. Åñabhadeva's heart was always uncontaminated and spiritual. Consequently all the sons born from the heart of Åñabhadeva were spiritually inclined. Nonetheless. Åñabhadeva suggested that His eldest son was superior, and He advised the others to serve him. All the brothers of Bharata Mahäräja were advised by Åñabhadeva to adhere to Bharata's service. The question may be asked why one should be attached to family members, for in the beginning it was advised that one should not be attached to home and family. However, it is also advised, mahéyasäm päda-rajo-'bhiñeka—one has to serve the mahéyän, one who is very spiritually advanced. Mahat-seväà dväram ähur vimukteù:  by serving the mahat, the exalted devotee, one's path for liberation is open. The family of Åñabhadeva should not be compared to an ordinary materialistic family. Bharata Mahäräja, Åñabhadeva's eldest son, was specifically very exalted. For this reason the other sons were advised to serve him for his pleasure. That was to be their duty."

            "content": "The Supreme Lord was advising Bharata Mahäräja to be the chief ruler of the planet. This is the real plan of the Supreme Lord. In the Battle of Kurukñetra, we find that Lord Kåñëa wanted Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira to be the supreme emperor of this planet. He never wanted Duryodhana to take the post. As stated in the previous verse, Lord Åñabhadeva's heart is hådayaà yatra dharmaù. The characteristic dharma is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä: surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To protect dharma (pariträëäya sädhünäm ), the Lord always wants the ruler of the earth to be a devotee. Then everything goes on nicely for the benefit of everyone. As soon as a demon rules the earth, everything becomes chaotic. At the present moment, the world is inclined toward the democratic process, but the people in general are all contaminated by the modes of passion and ignorance. Consequently they cannot select the right person to head the government. The president is selected by the votes of ignorant çüdras; therefore another çüdra is elected, and immediately the entire government becomes polluted. If people strictly followed the principles of Bhagavad-gétä, they would elect a person who is the Lord's devotee. Then automatically there would be good government. Åñabhadeva therefore recommended Bharata Mahäräja as the emperor of this planet. Serving a devotee means serving the Supreme Lord, for a devotee always represents the Lord. When a devotee is in charge, the government is always congenial and beneficial for everyone."
