    "translation": "After accepting the feature of avadhüta, a great saintly person without material cares, Lord Åñabhadeva passed through human society like a blind, deaf and dumb man, an idle stone, a ghost or a madman. Although people called Him such names, He remained silent and did not speak to anyone.",

However, such a person may be situated fully within himself and be satisfied with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, on whom he meditates. In other words, one who has surpassed the rules and regulations of varëäçrama-dharma is called avadhüta. Such a person has already surpassed the clutches of mäyä, and he lives completely separate and independent."
