    "translation": "When the living entity is covered by the mode of ignorance, he does not understand the individual living being and the supreme living being, and his mind is subjugated to fruitive activity. Therefore, until one has love for Lord Väsudeva, who is none other than Myself, he is certainly not delivered from having to accept a material body again and again.",

Generally everyone is involved in working hard day and night to improve his economic condition. Even when one understands the Vedic rituals, he becomes interested in promotion to heavenly planets, not knowing that one's real interest lies in returning home, back to Godhead. By acting on the platform of fruitive activity, one wanders throughout the universe in different species and forms. Unless he comes in contact with a devotee of the Lord, a guru, he does not become attached to the service of Lord Väsudeva. Knowledge of Väsudeva requires many births to understand. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä  in the instructions given by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu to Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé at Daçäçvamedha-ghäöa."
