As confirmed in Brahma-saàhitä: aëòäntara-sthaà paramäëu-cayäntara-stham. The Lord is situated in this universe as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. He is also situated within every atom. According to the Vedic statement: éçäväsyam idaà sarvam . The Supreme Lord is situated everywhere, and wherever He is situated is His temple. We even offer respects to a temple from a distant place, and all living entities should similarly be offered respect. This is different from the theory of pantheism, which holds that everything is God. Everything has a relationship with God because God is situated everywhere. We should not make any particular distinction between the poor and the rich like the foolish worshipers of daridra-näräyaëa. Näräyaëa is present in the rich as well as the poor. One should not simply think Näräyaëa is situated among the poor. He is everywhere. An advanced devotee will offer respects to everyone—even to cats and dogs."

They are always distinct. Every individual person is different from the Supreme Lord. It is a mistake to equate the individual living entity with the Supreme Lord on the plea of vivikta-dåk, sama-dåk. The Lord is always in an exalted position, even though He agrees to live everywhere. Çréla Madhväcärya, quoting Padma Puräëa, states: vivikta-dåñöi jévänäà dhiñëyatayä parameçvarasya bheda-dåñöiù. \"One who has clear vision and who is devoid of envy can see that the Supreme Lord is separate from all living entities, although He is situated in every living entity.\" Madhväcärya further quotes from Padma Puräëa:"
