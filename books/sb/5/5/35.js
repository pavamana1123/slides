    "translation": "O King Parékñit, just to show all the yogés the mystic process, Lord Åñabhadeva, the partial expansion of Lord Kåñëa, performed wonderful activities. Actually He was the master of liberation and was fully absorbed in transcendental bliss, which increased a thousandfold. Lord Kåñëa, Väsudeva, the son of Vasudeva, is the original source of Lord Åñabhadeva. There is no difference in Their constitution, and consequently Lord Åñabhadeva awakened the loving symptoms of crying, laughing and shivering. He was always absorbed in transcendental love. Due to this, all mystic powers automatically approached Him, such as the ability to travel in outer space at the speed of mind, to appear and disappear, to enter the bodies of others, and to see things far, far away. Although He could do all this, He did not exercise these powers.",

            "content": "The word çänta means completely peaceful. Unless all one's desires are fulfilled, one cannot be peaceful. Everyone is trying to fulfill his aspirations and desires, be they material or spiritual. Those in the material world are açänta (without peace) because they have so many desires to fulfill. The pure devotee, however, is without desire. Anyäbhiläñitä-çünya: a pure devotee is completely free from all kinds of material desire. Karmés, on the other hand, are simply full of desires because they try to enjoy sense gratification. They are not peaceful in this life, nor the next, during the past, present or future. Similarly, jïänés are always aspiring after liberation and trying to become one with the Supreme. Yogés are aspiring after many siddhis (powers)—aëimä, laghimä, präpti, etc. However, a devotee is not at all interested in these things because he is fully dependent on the mercy of Kåñëa. Kåñëa is yogeçvara, the possessor of all mystic powers (siddhis), and He is ätmäräma, fully self-satisfied. The yoga-siddhis are described in this verse. One can fly in outer space without the aid of a machine, and he can travel at the speed of mind. This means that as soon as a yogé desires to go somewhere within this universe or even beyond this universe, he can do so immediately. One cannot estimate the speed of mind, for within a second the mind can go many millions of miles. Sometimes yogés enter into the bodies of other people and act as they desire when their bodies are not working properly. When the body becomes old, a perfect yogé can find a young, able body. Giving up his old body, the yogé can enter into the young body and act as he pleases. Being a plenary expansion of Lord Väsudeva, Lord Åñabhadeva possessed all these mystic yoga powers, but He was satisfied with His devotional love of Kåñëa, which was evinced by the ecstatic symptoms, such as crying, laughing and shivering."
