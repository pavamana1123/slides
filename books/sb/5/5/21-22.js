    "translation": "Of the two energies manifest [spirit and dull matter], beings possessing living force [vegetables, grass, trees and plants] are superior to dull matter [stone, earth, etc.]. Superior to nonmoving plants and vegetables are worms and snakes, which can move. Superior to worms and snakes are animals that have developed intelligence. Superior to animals are human beings, and superior to human beings are ghosts because they have no material bodies. Superior to ghosts are the Gandharvas, and superior to them are the Siddhas. Superior to the Siddhas are the Kinnaras, and superior to them are the asuras. Superior to the asuras are the demigods, and of the demigods, Indra, the King of heaven, is supreme. Superior to Indra are the direct sons of Lord Brahmä, sons like King Dakña, and supreme among Brahmä's sons is Lord Çiva. Since Lord Çiva is the son of Lord Brahmä, Brahmä is considered superior, but Brahmä is also subordinate to Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because I am inclined to the brähmaëas, the brähmaëas are best of all.",

            "content": "In this verse the brähmaëas are given a position superior to that of the Supreme Lord. The idea is that the government should be conducted under the guidance of the brähmaëas. Although Åñabhadeva recommended His eldest son, Bharata, as emperor of the earth, he still had to follow the instructions of the brähmaëas in order to govern the world perfectly. The Lord is worshiped as brahmaëya-deva. The Lord is very fond of devotees, or brähmaëas. This does not refer to so-called caste brähmaëas, but to qualified brähmaëas. A brähmaëa should be qualified with the eight qualities mentioned in , such as çama, dama, satya and titikñä. The brähmaëas should always be worshiped and under their guidance the ruler should discharge his duty and rule the citizens. Unfortunately, in this age of Kali, the executive is not selected by very intelligent people, nor is he guided by qualified brähmaëas. Consequently, chaos results. The mass of people should be educated in Kåñëa consciousness so that according to the democratic process they can select a first-class devotee like Bharata Mahäräja to head the government. If the head of the state is headed by qualified brähmaëas, everything is completely perfect."

            "content": "In this verse, the evolutionary process is indirectly mentioned. The modern theory that life evolves from matter is to some extent supported in this verse because it is stated, bhüteñu vérudbhyaù. That is, the living entities evolve from vegetables, grass, plants and trees, which are superior to dull matter. In other words, matter also has the potency to manifest living entities in the form of vegetables. In this sense, life comes out of matter, but matter also comes out of life. As Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä , ahaà sarvasya prabhavo mattaù sarvaà pravartate: \"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.\""

            "content": "There are two energies—material and spiritual—and both originally come from Kåñëa. Kåñëa is the supreme living being. Although it may be said that in the material world a living force is generated from matter, it must be admitted that originally matter is generated from the supreme living being. Nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13). The conclusion is that everything, both material and spiritual, is generated from the Supreme Being. From the evolutionary point of view, perfection is reached when the living entity attains the platform of a brähmaëa. A brähmaëa is a worshiper of the Supreme Brahman, and the Supreme Brahman worships the brähmaëa. In other words, the devotee is subordinate to the Supreme Lord, and the Lord is inclined to see to the satisfaction of His devotee. A brähmaëa is called dvija-deva, and the Lord is called dvija-deva-deva. He is the Lord of brähmaëas."
