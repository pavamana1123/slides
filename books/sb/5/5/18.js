Çukräcärya was rejected by Bali Mahäräja due to his inability to save Bali Mahäräja from the path of repeated birth and death. Çukräcärya was not a pure devotee, he was more or less inclined to fruitive activity, and he objected when Bali Mahäräja promised to give everything to Lord Viñëu. Actually one is supposed to give everything to the Lord because everything belongs to the Lord. Consequently, the Supreme Lord advises in Bhagavad-gétä :"

            "content": "\"O son of Kunté, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.\" This is bhakti. Unless one is devoted, he cannot give everything to the Supreme Lord. Unless one can do so, he cannot become a spiritual master, husband, father or mother. Similarly, the wives of the brähmaëas who were performing sacrifices gave up their relatives just to satisfy Kåñëa. This is an example of a wife rejecting a husband who cannot deliver her from the impending dangers of birth and death. Similarly, Prahläda Mahäräja rejected his father, and Bharata Mahäräja rejected his mother (janané na sä syät). The word daivam indicates a demigod or one who accepts worship from a dependent. Ordinarily, the spiritual master, husband, father, mother or superior relative accepts worship from an inferior relative, but here Åñabhadeva forbids this. First the father, spiritual master or husband must be able to release the dependent from repeated birth and death. If he cannot do this, he plunges himself into the ocean of reproachment for his unlawful activities. Everyone should be very responsible and take charge of his dependents just as a spiritual master takes charge of his disciple or a father takes charge of his son. All these responsibilities cannot be discharged honestly unless one can save the dependent from repeated birth and death."
