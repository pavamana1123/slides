    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé said: Thus the great well-wisher of everyone, the Supreme Lord Åñabhadeva, instructed His own sons. Although they were perfectly educated and cultured, He instructed them just to set an example of how a father should instruct his sons before retiring from family life. Sannyäsés, who are no longer bound by fruitive activity and who have taken to devotional service after all their material desires have been vanquished, also learn by these instructions. Lord Åñabhadeva instructed His one hundred sons, of whom the eldest, Bharata, was a very advanced devotee and a follower of Vaiñëavas. In order to rule the whole world, the Lord enthroned His eldest son on the royal seat. Thereafter, although still at home, Lord Åñabhadeva lived like a madman, naked and with disheveled hair. Then the Lord took the sacrificial fire within Himself, and He left Brahmävarta to tour the whole world.",

Rather, these instructions were meant for sannyäsés who intend to become advanced devotees. Sannyäsés must abide by Lord Åñabhadeva's instructions while on the path of devotional service. Lord Åñabhadeva retired from family life and lived like a naked madman even while still with His family."
