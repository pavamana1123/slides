    "translation": "All the learned scholars have given their opinion. The mind is by nature very restless, and one should not make friends with it. If we place full confidence in the mind, it may cheat us at any moment. Even Lord Çiva became agitated upon seeing the Mohiné form of Lord Kåñëa, and Saubhari Muni also fell down from the mature stage of yogic perfection.",

To get out of this false struggle for existence and become happy in the material world, one has to control the mind and senses and be detached from material conditions. One should never neglect austerities and penances; one should always perform them. Lord Åñabhadeva personally showed us how to do this. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is specifically stated:"

One is forbidden to sit down in a solitary place even with one's mother, sister or daughter. In our Kåñëa consciousness movement it has been very difficult to disassociate ourselves from women in our society, especially in Western countries. We are therefore sometimes criticized, but nonetheless we are trying to give everyone a chance to chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra and thus advance spiritually. If we stick to the principle of chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra offenselessly, then, by the grace of Çréla Haridäsa Öhäkura, we may be saved from the allurement of women. However, if we are not very strict in chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, we may at any time fall victim to women."
