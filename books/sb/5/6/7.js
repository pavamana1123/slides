    "translation": "Actually Lord Åñabhadeva had no material body, but due to yogamäyä, He considered His body material, and therefore, because He played like an ordinary human being, He gave up the mentality of identifying with it. Following this principle, He began to wander all over the world. While traveling, He came to the province of Karëäöa in South India and passed through Koìka, Veìka and Kuöaka. He had no plan to travel this way, but He arrived near Kuöakäcala and entered a forest there. He placed stones within His mouth and began to wander through the forest, naked and with His hair disheveled like a madman.",
