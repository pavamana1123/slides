    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: My dear King, the Supreme Person, Mukunda, is actually the maintainer of all the members of the Päëòava and Yadu dynasties. He is your spiritual master, worshipable Deity, friend, and the director of your activities. To say nothing of this, He sometimes serves your family as a messenger or servant. This means He worked just as ordinary servants do. Those engaged in getting the Lord's favor attain liberation from the Lord very easily, but He does not very easily give the opportunity to render direct service unto Him.",

            "content": "While instructing Mahäräja Parékñit, Çukadeva Gosvämé thought it wise to encourage the King because the King might be thinking of the glorious position of various royal dynasties. Especially glorious is the dynasty of Priyavrata, in which the Supreme Lord Åñabhadeva incarnated. Similarly, the family of Uttänapäda Mahäräja, the father of Mahäräja Dhruva, is also glorious due to King Påthu's taking birth in it. The dynasty of Mahäräja Raghu is glorified because Lord Rämacandra appeared in that family. As far as the Yadu and Kuru dynasties are concerned, they existed simultaneously, but of the two, the Yadu dynasty was more glorious due to the appearance of Lord Kåñëa. Mahäräja Parékñit might have been thinking that the Kuru dynasty was not as fortunate as the others because the Supreme Lord did not appear in that family, neither as Kåñëa, Lord Rämacandra, Lord Åñabhadeva or Mahäräja Påthu. Therefore Parékñit Mahäräja was encouraged by Çukadeva Gosvämé in this particular verse."

            "content": "<br/>The Kuru dynasty may be considered more glorious due to the presence of devotees like the five Päëòavas, who rendered unalloyed devotional service. Although Lord Kåñëa did not appear in the Kuru dynasty. He was so obligated to the Päëòavas' devotional service that He acted as a maintainer of the family and spiritual master of the Päëòavas. Although He took birth in the Yadu dynasty, Lord Kåñëa was more affectionate to the Päëòavas. By His actions, Lord Kåñëa proved that He was more inclined to the Kuru dynasty than the Yadu dynasty. Indeed, Lord Kåñëa, indebted to the Päëòavas' devotional service, sometimes acted as their messenger, and He guided them through many dangerous situations. Therefore Mahäräja Parékñit should not have been saddened because Lord Kåñëa did not appear in his family. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always inclined toward His pure devotees, and by His action it is clear that liberation is not very important for the devotees. Lord Kåñëa easily gives one liberation, but He does not so easily give one the facility to become a devotee. Muktià dadäti karhicit sma na bhakti-yogam. Directly or indirectly, it is proved that bhakti-yoga is the basis for the supreme relationship with the Supreme Lord. It is far superior to liberation. For a pure devotee of the Lord, mukti is automatically attained."
