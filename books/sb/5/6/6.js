    "translation": "Lord Åñabhadeva was the head of all kings and emperors within this universe, but assuming the dress and language of an avadhüta, He acted as if dull and materially bound. Consequently no one could observe His divine opulence. He adopted this behavior just to teach yogés how to give up the body. Nonetheless, He maintained His original position as a plenary expansion of Lord Väsudeva, Kåñëa. Remaining always in that state, He gave up His pastimes as Lord Åñabhadeva within the material world. If, following in the footsteps of Lord Åñabhadeva, one can give up his subtle body, there is no chance that one will accept a material body again.",

One must understand his constitutional position and the constitutional position of the Supreme Lord as well. Both have the same spiritual identity. Maintaining oneself as a servant of the Supreme Lord, one should avoid rebirth in this material world. If one keeps himself spiritually fit and thinks of himself as an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord, he will be successful at the time he has to give up the material body."
