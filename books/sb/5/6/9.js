    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé continued speaking to Mahäräja Parékñit: My dear King, the King of Koìka, Veìka and Kuöaka whose name was Arhat, heard of the activities of Åñabhadeva and, imitating Åñabhadeva's principles, introduced a new system of religion. Taking advantage of Kali-yuga, the age of sinful activity, King Arhat, being bewildered, gave up the Vedic principles, which are free from risk, and concocted a new system of religion opposed to the Vedas. That was the beginning of the Jain dharma. Many other so-called religions followed this atheistic system.",

            "content": "When Lord Çré Kåñëa was present on this planet, a person named Pauëòraka imitated the four-handed Näräyaëa and declared himself the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He desired to compete with Kåñëa. Similarly, during the time of Lord Åñabhadeva, the King of Koìka and Veìka acted like a paramahaàsa and imitated Lord Åñabhadeva. He introduced a system of religion and took advantage of the fallen condition of the people in this age of Kali. It is said in Vedic literatures that people in this age will be more inclined to accept anyone as the Supreme Lord and accept any religious system opposed to Vedic principles. The people in this age are described as mandäù sumanda-matayaù. Generally they have no spiritual culture, and therefore they are very fallen. Due to this, they will accept any religious system. Due to their misfortune. they forget the Vedic principles. Following non-Vedic principles in this age, they think themselves the Supreme Lord and thus spread the cult of atheism all over the world."
