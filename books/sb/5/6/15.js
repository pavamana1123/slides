    "translation": "\"Who is that mystic yogé who can follow the examples of Lord Åñabhadeva even with his mind? Lord Åñabhadeva rejected all kinds of yogic perfection, which other yogés hanker to attain. Who is that yogé who can compare to Lord Åñabhadeva?\"",

Lord Åñabhadeva, however, never aspired for all these material things. Such siddhis (perfections) are presented by the illusory energy of the Lord. The real purpose of the yoga system is to achieve the favor and shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but this purpose is covered by the illusory energy of yogamäyä. So-called yogés are therefore allured by the superficial material perfections of aëimä, laghimä, präpti and so forth. Consequently ordinary yogés cannot compare to Lord Åñabhadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
