They will keep their hair long and consider themselves very beautiful, or they will pluck out their hair as the Jains do. They will keep themselves unclean and will not wash their mouths. Jains refer to Lord Åñabhadeva as their original preceptor. If such people are serious followers of Åñabhadeva, they must also take His instructions. In the Fifth Chapter of this canto, Åñabhadeva gave His one hundred sons instructions whereby they could become free from the clutches of mäyä. If one actually follows Åñabhadeva, he will certainly be delivered from the clutches of mäyä and return home, back to Godhead. If one strictly follows the instructions of Åñabhadeva given in the Fifth Chapter, he will certainly be liberated. Lord Åñabhadeva incarnated specifically to deliver these fallen souls."
