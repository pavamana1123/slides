    "translation": "King Parékñit asked Çukadeva Gosvämé: My dear Lord, for those who are completely pure in heart, knowledge is attained by the practice of bhakti-yoga, and attachment for fruitive activity is completely burned to ashes. For such people, the powers of mystic yoga automatically arise. They do not cause distress. Why, then, did Åñabhadeva neglect them?",

            "content": "A pure devotee is constantly engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whatever is necessary for the discharge of devotional service is automatically attained, though it may appear to be the result of mystic yoga power. Sometimes a yogé displays a little yogic power by manufacturing gold. A little quantity of gold captivates foolish people, and thus the yogé gets many followers, who are willing to accept such a tiny person as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a yogé may also advertise himself as Bhagavän. However, a devotee does not have to exhibit such magical wonders. Without practicing the mystic yogic process, he achieves even greater opulence all over the world. Under the circumstances, Lord Åñabhadeva refused to manifest mystic yogic perfections, and Mahäräja Parékñit asked why He did not accept them, since, for a devotee, they are not at all disturbing. A devotee is never distressed or satisfied by material opulence. His concern is how to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, by the grace of the Supreme Lord, a devotee achieves extraordinary opulence, he utilizes the opportunity for the Lord's service. He is not disturbed by the opulence."
