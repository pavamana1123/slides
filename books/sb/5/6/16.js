            "content": "The teachings of Lord Åñabhadeva are for the people of all yugas-Satya-yuga, Tretä-yuga, Dväpara-yuga and especially Kali-yuga. These instructions are so powerful that even in this age of Kali, one can attain perfection simply by explaining the instructions, following in the footsteps of the äcäryas or listening to the instructions with great attention. If one does so, one can attain the platform of pure devotional service to Lord Väsudeva. The pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees are recorded in Çrémad-Bhägavatam so that those who recite these pastimes and listen to them will become purified. Nityaà bhägavata-sevayä . One should either chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra or read Çrémad-Bhägavatam and thereby try to understand the characteristics and instructions of the Supreme Lord, who appeared as Lord Åñabhadeva, Lord Kapila and Lord Kåñëa. In this way one can become fully aware of the transcendental nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, one who knows the transcendental nature of the Lord's birth and activities attains liberation from material bondage and returns to Godhead."
