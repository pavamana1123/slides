The followers of Vedic literature understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different incarnations, and they are privileged to glorify the Lord by following the directions of Vedic literature. After realizing the glories of human life. such people should take up the mission to spread the importance of human life throughout the whole world. This is the mission of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. The word adhipuëyam indicates that there are certainly many other pious men throughout the world, but the people of Bhärata-varña are even more pious. Therefore they are fit to spread Kåñëa Consciousness throughout the world for the benefit of all human society. Çréla Madhväcärya also recognizes the land of Bhärata-varña: viçeñäd bhärate puëyam. Throughout the world, there is no question of bhagavad-bhakti or devotional service, but the people of Bhärata-varña can easily understand the devotional service of the Lord. Thus every inhabitant of Bhärata-varña can perfect his life by discharging bhagavad-bhakti and then preaching this cult throughout the world for the benefit of everyone."
