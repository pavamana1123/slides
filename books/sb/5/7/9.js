The devotees worship all these forms according to their liking, and the Lord, out of His affection, presents Himself as arcä-vigraha. He sometimes presents Himself personally before the devotee out of reciprocation or affection. A devotee is always fully surrendered to the loving service of the Lord, and the Lord is visible to the devotee according to the devotee's desires. He may be present in the form of Lord Räma, Lord Kåñëa, Lord Nåsiàhadeva and so on. Such is the exchange of love between the Lord and His devotees."
