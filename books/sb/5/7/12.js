    "translation": "That most exalted devotee, Mahäräja Bharata, in this way engaged constantly in the devotional service of the Lord. Naturally his love for Väsudeva, Kåñëa, increased more and more and melted his heart. Consequently he gradually lost all attachment for regulative duties. The hairs of his body stood on end, and all the ecstatic bodily symptoms were manifest. Tears flowed from his eyes, so much so that he could not see anything. Thus he constantly meditated on the reddish lotus feet of the Lord. At that time, his heart, which was like a lake, was filled with the water of ecstatic love. When his mind was immersed in that lake, he even forgot the regulative service to the Lord.",

            "content": "When one is actually advanced in ecstatic love for Kåñëa, eight transcendental, blissful symptoms are manifest in the body. Those are the symptoms of perfection arising from loving service to the Supreme Personality, of Godhead. Since Mahäräja Bharata was constantly, engaged in devotional service, all the symptoms of ecstatic love were manifest in his body."
