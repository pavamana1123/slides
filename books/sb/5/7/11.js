    "translation": "In the gardens of Pulaha-äçrama, Mahäräja Bharata lived alone and collected a variety of flowers, twigs and tulasé leaves. He also collected the water of the Gaëòaké River, as well as various roots, fruits and bulbs. With these he offered food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva, and, worshiping Him, he remained satisfied. In this way his heart was completely uncontaminated, and he did not have the least desire for material enjoyment. All material desires vanished. In this steady position, he felt full satisfaction and was situated in devotional service.",

This is obtainable only when one is completely freed from the desire for material sense gratification and is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä: patraà puñpaà phalaà toyaà yo me bhaktyä prayacchati . Worship of the Lord is not at all expensive. One can offer the Lord a leaf, a flower, a little fruit and some water. The Supreme Lord accepts these offerings when they are offered with love and devotion. In this way, one can become freed from material desires. As long as one maintains material desires, he cannot be happy. As soon as one engages in the devotional service of the Lord, his mind is purified of all material desires. Then one becomes fully satisfied."
