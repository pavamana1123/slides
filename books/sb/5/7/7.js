    "translation": "In this way, being purified by ritualistic sacrifices, the heart of Mahäräja Bharata was completely uncontaminated. His devotional service unto Väsudeva, Lord Kåñëa, increased day after day. Lord Kåñëa, the son of Vasudeva, is the original Personality of Godhead manifest as the Supersoul [Paramätmä] as well as the impersonal Brahman. Yogés meditate upon the localized Paramätmä situated in the heart, jïänés worship the impersonal Brahman as the Supreme Absolute Truth, and devotees worship Väsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose transcendental body is described in the çästras. His body is decorated with the Çrévatsa, the Kaustubha jewel and a flower garland, and His hands hold a conchshell, disc, club and lotus flower. Devotees like Närada always think of Him within their hearts.",
