    "translation": "With great faith King Bharata performed various kinds of sacrifice. He performed the sacrifices known as agni-hotra, darça, pürëamäsa, cäturmäsya, paçu-yajïa [wherein a horse is sacrificed] and soma-yajïa [wherein a kind of beverage is offered]. Sometimes these sacrifices were performed completely and sometimes partially. In any case, in all the sacrifices the regulations of cäturhotra were strictly followed. In this way Bharata Mahäräja worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

Actually the animal was offered in the sacrificial fire to get a rejuvenated life. Generally an old animal was sacrificed in the fire. and it would come out again in a youthful body. Some of the rituals however, did not require animal sacrifice. In the present age, animal sacrifices are forbidden. As stated by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu:"

After all, sacrifices are executed to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yajïärtha-karma: such activities should be carried out for the Supreme Lord's pleasure. In this age of Kali, the Supreme Lord in His incarnation of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu should be worshiped with His associates by performance of saìkértana-yajïa, the congregational chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra. This process is accepted by intelligent men. Yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù. The word sumedhasaù refers to intelligent men who possess very good brain substance."
