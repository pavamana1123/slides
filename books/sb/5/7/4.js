Some of the citizens were brähmaëas, some were kñatriyas, and some were vaiçyas and çüdras. It is the duty of the government to see that the citizens act according to these material divisions for their spiritual advancement. No one should remain unemployed or unoccupied in any way. One must work as a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra on the material path. and on the spiritual path, everyone should act as a brahmacäré, gåhastha, vänaprastha or sannyäsé. Although formerly the government was a monarchy, all the kings were very affectionate toward the citizens, and they strictly kept them engaged in their respective duties. Therefore society was very smoothly conducted."
