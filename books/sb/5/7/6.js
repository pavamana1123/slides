    "translation": "After performing the preliminaries of various sacrifices, Mahäräja Bharata offered the results in the name of religion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva. In other words, he performed all the yajïas for the satisfaction of Lord Väsudeva, Kåñëa. Mahäräja Bharata thought that since the demigods were different parts of Väsudeva's body, He controls those who are explained in the Vedic mantras. By thinking in this way, Mahäräja Bharata was freed from all material contamination, such as attachment, lust and greed. When the priests were about to offer the sacrificial ingredients into the fire, Mahäräja Bharata expertly understood how the offering made to different demigods was simply an offering to the different limbs of the Lord. For instance, Indra is the arm of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Sürya [the sun] is His eye. Thus Mahäräja Bharata considered that the oblations offered to different demigods were actually offered unto the different limbs of Lord Väsudeva.",

A yajïa may be carried out to satisfy a particular demigod, but when the yajïa is offered to the yajïa-puruña, Näräyaëa, the demigods are satisfied. The purpose of performing different yajïas is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. One may perform them in the name of different demigods or directly. If we directly offer oblations to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods are automatically satisfied. If we water the root of a tree, the branches, twigs, fruits and flowers are automatically satisfied. When one offers sacrifices to different demigods, one should remember that the demigods are simply parts of the body of the Supreme. If we worship the hand of a person, we intend to satisfy the person himself. If we massage a person's legs, we do not really serve the legs but the person who possesses the legs. All the demigods are different parts of the Lord, and if we offer service to them, we actually serve the Lord Himself. Demigod worship is mentioned in Brahma-saàhitä, but actually the çlokas advocate worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda. For instance, worship of the goddess Durgä is mentioned this way in Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38):"

There are many offerings to different demigods, and one should always remember that these offerings are usually meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bharata Mahäräja did not aspire to receive some benediction from demigods. His aim was to please the Supreme Lord. In the Mahäbhärata, among the thousand names of Viñëu, it is said yajïa-bhug yajïa-kåd yajïaù. The enjoyer of yajïa, the performer of yajïa and yajïa itself are the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is the performer of everything, but out of ignorance the living entity thinks that he is the actor.

A devotee may have a priest perform some karma-käëòa, and the priest may not be a pure Vaiñëava, but because the devotee wants to please the Supreme Lord, he should not be criticized. The word apürva is very significant. The resultant actions of karma are called apürva. When we act piously or impiously, immediate results do not ensue. We therefore wait for the results, which are called apürva. The results are manifest in the future. Even the smärtas accept this apürva. Pure devotees simply act for the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the results of their activities are spiritual, or permanent. They are not like those of the karmés, which are nonpermanent. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä :"
