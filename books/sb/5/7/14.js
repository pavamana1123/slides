As stated in Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38), aëòäntara-stha-paramäëu-cayäntara-stham: \"He enters the universe and the atom as well.\" In the Åg Veda, the predominating Deity of the sun is worshiped by, this mantra: dhyeyaù sadä savitå-maëòala-madhya-varti näräyaëaù sarasijäsana-sanniviñöaù. Näräyaëa sits on His lotus flower within the sun. By reciting this mantra, every living entity should take shelter of Näräyaëa just as the sun rises. According to modern scientists, the material world rests on the sun's effulgence. Due to the sunshine, all planets are rotating and vegetables are growing. We also have information that the moonshine helps vegetables and herbs grow. Actually Näräyaëa within the sun is maintaining the entire universe; therefore Näräyaëa should be worshiped by the Gäyatré mantra or the Åg mantra."
