            "content": "In this chapter, the activities of King Bharata Mahäräja, the emperor of the whole world, are described. Bharata Mahäräja performed various ritualistic ceremonies (Vedic yajïas) and satisfied the Supreme Lord by his different modes of worship. In due course of time, he left home and resided in Hardwar and passed his days in devotional activities. Being ordered by his father, Lord Åñabhadeva, Bharata Mahäräja married Païcajané, the daughter of Viçvarüpa. After this, he ruled the whole world peacefully. Formerly this planet was known as Ajanäbha, and after the reign of Bharata Mahäräja it became known as Bhärata-varña. Bharata Mahäräja begot five sons in the womb of Païcajané, and he named the sons Sumati, Räñörabhåta, Sudarçana, Ävaraëa and Dhümraketu. Bharata Mahäräja was very rigid in executing religious principles and following in the footsteps of his father. He therefore ruled the citizens very successfully. Because he performed various yajïas to satisfy the Supreme Lord, he was personally very satisfied. Being of undisturbed mind, he increased his devotional activities unto Lord Väsudeva. Bharata Mahäräja was competent in understanding the principles of saintly persons like Närada, and he followed in the footsteps of the sages. He also kept Lord Väsudeva constantly within his heart. After finishing his kingly duties, he divided his kingdom among his five sons. He then left home and went to the place of Pulaha known as Pulahäçrama. There he ate forest vegetables and fruits, and worshiped Lord Väsudeva with everything available. Thus he increased his devotion toward Väsudeva, and he automatically began to realize further his transcendental, blissful life. Due to his highly advanced spiritual position, there were sometimes visible in his body the añöa-sättvika transformations, such as ecstatic crying and bodily trembling, which are symptoms of love of Godhead. It is understood that Mahäräja Bharata worshiped the Supreme Lord with the mantras mentioned in the Åg Veda, generally known as Gäyatré mantra, which aim at the Supreme Näräyaëa situated within the sun."
