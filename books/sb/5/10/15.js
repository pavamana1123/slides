    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: O best of the Päëòu dynasty [Mahäräja Parékñit], the King of the Sindhu and Sauvéra states [Mahäräja Rahügaëa] had great faith in discussions of the Absolute Truth. Being thus qualified, he heard from Jaòa Bharata that philosophical presentation which is approved by all scriptures on the mystic yoga process and which slackens the knot in the heart. His material conception of himself as a king was thus destroyed. He immediately descended from his palanquin and fell flat on the ground with his head at the lotus feet of Jaòa Bharata in such a way that he might be excused for his insulting words against the great brähmaëa. He then prayed as follows.",

Formerly they could understand the philosophy of life and knew how to train the citizens to come to the same standard. In other words, they knew how to deliver the citizens from the entanglement of birth and death. When Mahäräja Daçaratha ruled Ayodhyä, the great sage Viçvämitra once came to him to take away Lord Rämacandra and Lakñmaëa to the forest to kill a demon. When the saintly person Viçvämitra came to the court of Mahäräja Daçaratha, the King, in order to receive the saintly person, asked him, aihiñöaà yat tat punar janma jayäya. He asked the sage whether everything was going on well in his endeavor to conquer the repetition of birth and death. The whole process of Vedic civilization is based on this point. We must know how to conquer the repetition of birth and death. Mahäräja Rahügaëa also knew the purpose of life; therefore when Jaòa Bharata put the philosophy of life before him, he immediately appreciated it. This is the foundation of Vedic society. Learned scholars, brähmaëas, saintly persons and sages who were fully aware of the Vedic purpose advised the royal order how to benefit the general masses, and by their cooperation, the general masses were benefited. Therefore everything was successful. Mahäräja Rahügaëa attained this perfection of understanding the value of human life; therefore he regretted his insulting words to Jaòa Bharata, and he immediately descended from his palanquin and fell down at the lotus feet of Jaòa Bharata in order to be excused and to hear from him further about the values of life known as brahma jijïäsä (inquiry into the Absolute Truth). At the present moment, high government officials are ignorant of the values of life, and when saintly persons endeavor to broadcast the Vedic knowledge, the so-called executives do not offer their respectful obeisances but try to obstruct the spiritual propaganda. Thus one can say that the former kingly government was like heaven and that the present government is like hell."
