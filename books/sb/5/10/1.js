    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: My dear King, after this, King Rahügaëa, ruler of the states known as Sindhu and Sauvéra, was going to Kapiläçrama. When the King's chief palanquin carriers reached the banks of the River Ikñumaté, they needed another carrier. Therefore they began searching for someone, and by chance they came upon Jaòa Bharata. They considered the fact that Jaòa Bharata was very young and strong and had firm limbs. Like cows and asses, he was quite fit to carry loads. Thinking in this way, although the great soul Jaòa Bharata was unfit for such work, they nonetheless unhesitatingly forced him to carry the palanquin.",
