    "translation": "O lord, please note that we are not at all negligent in discharging our duties. We have been faithfully carrying this palanquin according to your desire, but this man who has been recently engaged to work with us cannot walk very swiftly.

Çüdras do not sympathize with other living beings, but a Vaiñëava cannot act like a çüdra. Whenever a çüdra and a brähmaëa Vaiñëava are combined, there will certainly be imbalance in the execution of duties. The çüdras were walking with the palanquin without at all caring for the ants on the ground, but Jaòa Bharata could not act like a çüdra, and therefore difficulty arose."
