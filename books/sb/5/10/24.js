    "translation": "Whatever you have spoken appears to me to be contradictory. O best friend of the distressed, I have committed a great offense by insulting you. I was puffed up with false prestige due to possessing the body of a king. For this I have certainly become an offender. Therefore I pray that you kindly glance at me with your causeless mercy. If you do so, I can be relieved from sinful activities brought about by insulting you.",

            "content": "Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has said that by offending a Vaiñëava, one finishes all his spiritual activities. Offending a Vaiñëava is considered the mad elephant offense. A mad elephant can destroy an entire garden which has been developed with great labor. One may attain the topmost platform of devotional service, but somehow or other if he offends a Vaiñëava, the whole structure collapses. Unconsciously, King Rahügaëa offended Jaòa Bharata, but due to his good sense, he asked to be excused. This is the process by which one can be relieved from a vaiñëava-aparädha. Kåñëa is always very simple and by nature merciful. When one commits an offense at the feet of a Vaiñëava, one must immediately apologize to such a personality so that his spiritual advancement may not be hampered."
