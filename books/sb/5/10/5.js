    "translation": "King Rahügaëa could understand the speeches given by the carriers, who were afraid of being punished. He could also understand that simply due to the fault of one person, the palanquin was not being carried properly. Knowing this perfectly well and hearing their appeal, he became a little angry, although he was very advanced in political science and was very experienced. His anger arose due to his inborn nature as a king. Actually King Rahügaëa's mind was covered by the mode of passion, and he therefore spoke as follows to Jaòa Bharata, whose Brahman effulgence was not clearly visible, being covered like a fire covered by ashes.",

Although the King was very upright and advanced in political science and governmental management, he was nonetheless in the mode of passion, and therefore, due to a slight agitation, he became angry. Jaòa Bharata, despite all kinds of injustice endured because of his deaf and dumb display, remained silent by the strength of his spiritual advancement. Nonetheless his brahma-tejaù, his Brahman effulgence, was indistinctly visible in his person."
