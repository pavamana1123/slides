    "translation": "My dear sir, I am not at all afraid of the thunderbolt of King Indra, nor am I afraid of the serpentine, piercing trident of Lord Çiva. I do not care about the punishment of Yamaräja, the superintendent of death, nor am I afraid of fire, scorching sun, moon, wind, nor the weapons of Kuvera. Yet I am afraid of offending a brähmaëa. I am very much afraid of this.",

            "content": "When Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu was instructing Rüpa Gosvämé at the Daçäçvamedha-ghäöa in Prayäga, He pointed out very clearly the seriousness of offending a Vaiñëava. He compared the vaiñëava-aparädha to häté mätä, a mad elephant. When a mad elephant enters a garden, it spoils all the fruits and flowers. Similarly, if one offends a Vaiñëava, he spoils all his spiritual assets. Offending a brähmaëa is very dangerous, and this was known to Mahäräja Rahügaëa. He therefore frankly admitted his fault. There are many dangerous things—thunderbolts, fire, Yamaräja's punishment, the punishment of Lord Çiva's trident, and so forth—but none is considered as serious as offending a brähmaëa like Jaòa Bharata. Therefore Mahäräja Rahügaëa immediately descended from his palanquin and fell flat before the lotus feet of the brähmaëa Jaòa Bharata just to be excused."
