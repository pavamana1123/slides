He was formerly the emperor Bharata Mahäräja, and he was now the most exalted personality among learned sages and the master of all mystic powers. Although Jaòa Bharata was an ordinary living entity, he had inherited all the knowledge given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kapiladeva. He could therefore be taken directly as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura in his stanzas to the spiritual master: säkñäd-dharitvena samasta-çästraiù. An exalted personality like Jaòa Bharata is as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because he fully represents the Lord by giving knowledge to others. Jaòa Bharata is herein accepted as the direct representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because he was imparting knowledge on behalf of the Supreme Lord. Therefore Mahäräja Rahügaëa concluded that it was appropriate to ask him about ätma-tattva, the spiritual science. Tad-vijïänärthaà sa gurum eväbhigacchet (MU 1.2.12). This Vedic injunction is also confirmed herein. If anyone is at all interested in knowing the spiritual science (brahma jijïäsä), he must approach a guru like Jaòa Bharata."
