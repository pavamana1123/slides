The path of bhakti is not at all difficult if we follow in the footsteps of previous äcäryas and authorities, but those who are too materially contaminated by the modes of material nature cannot follow them. Although Bali Mahäräja was actually following the path of his grandfather, because of his great humility he thought that he was not. It is characteristic of advanced Vaiñëavas following the principles of bhakti that they think themselves ordinary human beings. This is not an artificial exhibition of humility; a Vaiñëava sincerely thinks this way and therefore never admits his exalted position."
