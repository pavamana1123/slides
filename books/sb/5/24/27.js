    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: My dear King, how shall I glorify the character of Bali Mahäräja? The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of the three worlds, who is most compassionate to His own devotee, stands with club in hand at Bali Mahäräja's door. When Rävaëa, the powerful demon, came to gain victory over Bali Mahäräja, Vämanadeva kicked him a distance of eighty thousand miles with His big toe. I shall explain the character and activities of Bali Mahäräja later [in the Eighth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam].",
