    "translation": "The next planet below Atala is Vitala, wherein Lord Çiva, who is known as the master of gold mines, lives with his personal associates, the ghosts and similar living entities. Lord Çiva, as the progenitor, engages in sex with Bhaväné, the progenitress, to produce living entities, and from the mixture of their vital fluid the river named Häöaké is generated. When fire, being made to blaze by the wind, drinks of this river and then sizzles and spits it out, it produces gold called Häöaka. The demons who live on that planet with their wives decorate themselves with various ornaments made from that gold, and thus they live there very happily.",

It is said that the alchemists of the medieval age tried to prepare gold from base metal, and Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé also states that when bell metal is treated with mercury, it can produce gold. Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé mentions this in regard to the initiation of low-class men to turn them into brähmaëas. Sanätana Gosvämé said:"

One who stops these four principles of sinful activity and chants the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra can certainly become a pure brähmaëa through the process of bona fide initiation, as suggested by Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé."

The alchemists of the medieval age tried to manufacture gold, but they were unsuccessful, perhaps because they did not follow the right instructions."
