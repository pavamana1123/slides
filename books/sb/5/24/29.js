    "translation": "The planetary system below Talätala is known as Mahätala. It is the abode of many-hooded snakes, descendants of Kadrü, who are always very angry. The great snakes who are prominent are Kuhaka, Takñaka, Käliya and Suñeëa. The snakes in Mahätala are always disturbed by fear of Garuòa, the carrier of Lord Viñëu, but although they are full of anxiety, some of them nevertheless sport with their wives, children, friends and relatives.",

They live with their wives and children and consider themselves very happy, although they are always full of anxiety because of Garuòa, who comes there to destroy them. This is the way of material life. Even if one lives in the most abominable condition, he still thinks himself happy with his wife, children, friends and relatives."
