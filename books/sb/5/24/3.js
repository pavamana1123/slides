    "translation": "After hearing from the sun and moon demigods about Rähu's attack, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, engages His disc, known as the Sudarçana cakra, to protect them. The Sudarçana cakra is the Lord's most beloved devotee and is favored by the Lord. The intense heat of its effulgence, meant for killing non-Vaiñëavas, is unbearable to Rähu, and he therefore flees in fear of it. During the time Rähu disturbs the sun or moon, there occurs what people commonly know as an eclipse.",

            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, is always the protector of His devotees, who are also known as demigods. The controlling demigods are most obedient to Lord Viñëu, although they also want material sense enjoyment, and that is why they are called demigods, or almost godly. Although Rähu attempts to attack both the sun and the moon, they are protected by Lord Viñëu. Being very afraid of Lord Viñëu's cakra, Rähu cannot stay in front of the sun or moon for more than a muhürta (forty-eight minutes). The phenomenon that occurs when Rähu blocks the light of the sun or moon is called an eclipse. The attempt of the scientists of this earth to go to the moon is as demoniac as Rähu's attack. Of course, their attempts will be failures because no one can enter the moon or sun so easily. Like the attack of Rähu, such attempts will certainly be failures."
