    "translation": "Below the planet Vitala is another planet, known as Sutala, where the great son of Mahäräja Virocana, Bali Mahäräja, who is celebrated as the most pious king, resides even now. For the welfare of Indra, the King of heaven, Lord Viñëu appeared in the form of a dwarf brahmacäré as the son of Aditi and tricked Bali Mahäräja by begging for only three paces of land but taking all the three worlds. Being very pleased with Bali Mahäräja for giving all his possessions, the Lord returned his kingdom and made him richer than the opulent King Indra. Even now, Bali Mahäräja engages in devotional service by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the planet of Sutala.",

            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as Uttamaçloka, \"He who is worshiped by the best of selected Sanskrit verses,\" and His devotees such as Bali Mahäräja are also worshiped by puëya-çloka, verses that increase one's piety. Bali Mahäräja offered everything to the Lord—his wealth, his kingdom and even his own body (sarvätma-nivedane baliù). The Lord appeared before Bali Mahäräja as a brähmaëa beggar, and Bali Mahäräja gave Him everything he had. However, Bali Mahäräja did not become poor; by donating all his possessions to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he became a successful devotee and got everything back again with the blessings of the Lord. Similarly, those who give contributions to expand the activities of the Kåñëa consciousness movement and to accomplish its objectives will never be losers; they will get their wealth back with the blessings of Lord Kåñëa. On the other side, those who collect contributions on behalf of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness should be very careful not to use even a farthing of the collection for any purpose other than the transcendental loving service of the Lord."
