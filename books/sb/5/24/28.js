    "translation": "Beneath the planet known as Sutala is another planet, called Talätala, which is ruled by the Dänava demon named Maya. Maya is known as the äcärya [master] of all the mäyävés, who can invoke the powers of sorcery. For the benefit of the three worlds, Lord Çiva, who is known as Tripuräri, once set fire to the three kingdoms of Maya, but later, being pleased with him, he returned his kingdom. Since that time, Maya Dänava has been protected by Lord Çiva, and therefore he falsely thinks that he need not fear the Sudarçana cakra of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
