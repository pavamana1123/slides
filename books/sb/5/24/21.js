    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone's heart as the Supersoul, sells Himself to His devotees such as Närada Muni. In other words, the Lord gives pure love to such devotees and gives Himself to those who love Him purely. Great, self-realized mystic yogés such as the four Kumäras also derive great transcendental bliss from realizing the Supersoul within themselves.",
