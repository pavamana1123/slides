    "translation": "In these seven planetary systems, which are also known as the subterranean heavens [bila-svarga], there are very beautiful houses, gardens and places of sense enjoyment, which are even more opulent than those in the higher planets because the demons have a very high standard of sensual pleasure, wealth and influence. Most of the residents of these planets, who are known as Daityas, Dänavas and Nägas, live as householders. Their wives, children, friends and society are all fully engaged in illusory, material happiness. The sense enjoyment of the demigods is sometimes disturbed, but the residents of these planets enjoy life without disturbances. Thus they are understood to be very attached to illusory happiness.",

            "content": "According to the statements of Prahläda Mahäräja, material enjoyment is mäyä-sukha, illusory enjoyment. A Vaiñëava is full of anxieties for the deliverance of all living entities from such false enjoyment. Prahläda Mahäräja says, mäyä-sukhäya bharam udvahato vimüòhän:  these fools (vimüòhas) are engaged in material happiness, which is surely temporary. Whether in the heavenly planets, the lower planets or the earthly planets, people are engrossed in temporary, material happiness, forgetting that in due course of time they have to change their bodies according to the material laws and suffer the repetition of birth, death, old age and disease. Not caring what will happen in the next birth, gross materialists are simply busy enjoying during the present short span of life. A Vaiñëava is always anxious to give all such bewildered materialists the real happiness of spiritual bliss."
