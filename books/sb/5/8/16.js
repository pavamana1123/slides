    "translation": "Bharata Mahäräja would think: Alas, the deer is now helpless. I am now very unfortunate, and my mind is like a cunning hunter, for it is always filled with cheating propensities and cruelty. The deer has put its faith in me, just as a good man who has a natural interest in good behavior forgets the misbehavior of a cunning friend and puts his faith in him. Although I have proved faithless, will this deer return and place its faith in me?",

Due to his attachment for the animal, he thought that the animal was as noble and exalted as he himself was. According to the logic of ätmavan manyate jagat, everyone thinks of others according to his own position. Therefore Mahäräja Bharata felt that the deer had left him due to his negligence and that due to the animal's noble heart, it would again return."
