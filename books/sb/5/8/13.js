    "translation": "When entering the forest, the animal would appear very attractive to Mahäräja Bharata due to its childish behavior. Mahäräja Bharata would even take the deer on his shoulders and carry it due to affection. His heart was so filled with great love for the deer that he would sometimes keep it on his lap or, when sleeping, on his chest. In this way he felt great pleasure in fondling the animal.",

What, then, was the use of his renouncing his family? One who is serious in advancing his spiritual life should be very cautious not to become attached to anything but Kåñëa. Sometimes, in order to preach, we have to accept many material activities, but we should remember that everything is for Kåñëa. If we remember this, there is no chance of our being victimized by material activities."
