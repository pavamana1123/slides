    "translation": "Remaining in that äçrama, the great King Bharata Mahäräja was now very careful not to fall victim to bad association. Without disclosing his past to anyone, he remained in that äçrama and ate dry leaves only. He was not exactly alone, for he had the association of the Supersoul. In this way he waited for death in the body of a deer. Bathing in that holy place, he finally gave up that body.",

            "content": "Holy places like Våndävana, Hardwar, Prayäga and Jagannätha Puré are especially meant for the execution of devotional service. Våndävana specifically is the most exalted and preferred holy place for Vaiñëava devotees of Lord Kåñëa who are aspiring to return back to Godhead, the Vaikuëöha planets. There are many devotees in Våndävana who regularly bathe in the Yamunä, and this cleanses all the contamination of the material world. By constantly chanting and hearing the holy names and pastimes of the Supreme Lord, one certainly becomes purified and becomes a fit candidate for liberation. However, if one purposefully falls victim to sense gratification, he has to be punished, at least for one lifetime, like Bharata Mahäräja."
