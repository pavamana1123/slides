    "translation": "If Bharata Mahäräja sometimes could not see the deer, his mind would be very agitated. He would become like a miser, who, having obtained some riches, had lost them and had then become very unhappy. When the deer was gone, he would be filled with anxiety and would lament due to separation. Thus he would become illusioned and speak as follows.",

            "content": "If a poor man loses some money or gold, he at once becomes very agitated. Similarly, the mind of Mahäräja Bharata would become agitated when he did not see the deer. This is an example of how our attachment can be transferred. If our attachment is transferred to the Lord's service, we progress. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé prayed to the Lord that he would be as naturally attracted to the Lord's service as young men and young women are naturally attracted to each other. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu exhibited such attachment to the Lord when He jumped into the ocean or cried at night in separation. However, if our attachment is diverted to material things instead of to the Lord, we will fall down from the spiritual platform."
