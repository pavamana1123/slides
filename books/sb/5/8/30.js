    "translation": "Although Bharata Mahäräja received the body of a deer, by constant repentance he became completely detached from all material things. He did not disclose these things to anyone, but he left his mother deer in a place known as Kälaïjara Mountain, where he was born. He again went to the forest of Çälagräma and to the äçrama of Pulastya and Pulaha.",

            "content": "It is significant that Mahäräja Bharata, by the grace of Väsudeva, remembered his past life. He did not waste a moment; he returned to Pulaha-äçrama to the village known as Çälagräma. Association is very meaningful; therefore ISKCON tries to perfect one who enters the society. The members of this society should always remember that the society is not like a free hotel. All the members should be very careful to execute their spiritual duties so that whoever comes will automatically become a devotee and will be able to return back to Godhead in this very life. Although Bharata Mahäräja acquired the body of a deer, he again left his hearth and home, in this case the Mountain Kälaïjara. No one should be captivated by his birthplace and family; one should take shelter of the association of devotees and cultivate Kåñëa consciousness."
