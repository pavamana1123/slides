    "translation": "The physical elements, nature, the original cause, culture, destiny and the time element are all material causes. Agitated by these material causes, the eleven functions transform into hundreds of functions and then into thousands and then into millions. But all these transformations do not take place automatically by mutual combination. Rather, they are under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

They are under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gétä , Kåñëa says that the Lord is situated in everyone's heart (sarvasya cähaà hådi sanniviñöo mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca). As mentioned herein, Supersoul (kñetrajïa) is directing everything. The living entity is also kñetrajïa, but the supreme kñetrajïa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the witness and order giver. Under His direction, everything takes place. The different inclinations of the living entity are created by his own nature or his expectations, and he is trained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the agency of material nature. The body, nature and the physical elements are under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They do not function automatically. Nature is neither independent nor automatic. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is behind nature."
