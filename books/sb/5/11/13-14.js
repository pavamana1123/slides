    "translation": "There are two kinds of kñetrajïa—the living entity, as explained above, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is explained as follows. He is the all-pervading cause of creation. He is full in Himself and is not dependent on others. He is perceived by hearing and direct perception. He is self-effulgent and does not experience birth, death, old age or disease. He is the controller of all the demigods, beginning with Lord Brahmä. He is called Näräyaëa, and He is the shelter of living entities after the annihilation of this material world. He is full of all opulences, and He is the resting place of everything material. He is therefore known as Väsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His own potency, He is present within the hearts of all living entities, just as the air or vital force is within the bodies of all beings, moving and nonmoving. In this way He controls the body. In His partial feature, the Supreme Personality of Godhead enters all bodies and controls them.",

Every living being is controlled by the supreme living being, Paramätmä, who resides within everyone's heart. He is the puruña, the puruña-avatära, who creates this material world. The first puruña-avatära is Mahä-Viñëu, and that Mahä-Viñëu is the plenary portion of the plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Kåñëa's first expansion is Baladeva, and His next expansions are Väsudeva, Saìkarñaëa, Aniruddha and Pradyumna. Väsudeva is the original cause of the brahmajyoti, and the brahmajyoti is the expansion of the rays of the body of Väsudeva."
