    "translation": "The brähmaëa Jaòa Bharata said: My dear King, although you are not at all experienced, you are trying to speak like a very experienced man. Consequently you cannot be considered an experienced person. An experienced person does not speak the way you are speaking about the relationship between a master and a servant or about material pains and pleasures. These are simply external activities. Any advanced, experienced man, considering the Absolute Truth, does not talk in this way.",

Açocyän anvaçocas tvaà prajïä-vädäàç ca bhäñase: \"While speaking learned words, you are lamenting for what is not worthy of grief.\"  Similarly, among people in general, 99.9 percent try to talk like experienced advisers, but they are actually devoid of spiritual knowledge and are therefore like inexperienced children speaking nonsensically. Consequently their words cannot be given any importance. One has to learn from Kåñëa or His devotee. If one speaks on the basis of this experience-that is, on the basis of spiritual knowledge—one's words are valuable. At the present moment, the entire world is full of foolish people. Bhagavad-gétä describes these people as müòhas. They are trying to rule human society, but because they are devoid of spiritual knowledge, the entire world is in a chaotic condition. To be released from these miserable conditions, one has to become Kåñëa conscious and take lessons from an exalted personality like Jaòa Bharata, Lord Kåñëa and Kapiladeva. That is the only way to solve the problems of material life."
