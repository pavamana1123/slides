    "translation": "The great åñi Çukadeva Gosvämé said: My dear King, there is no limit to the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's material energy. This material world is a transformation of the material qualities [sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa], yet no one could possibly explain it perfectly, even in a lifetime as long as that of Brahmä No one in the material world is perfect, and an imperfect person could not describe this material universe accurately, even after continued speculation. O King, I shall nevertheless try to explain to you the principal regions, such as Bhü-goloka [Bhüloka], with their names, forms, measurements and various symptoms.",

Modern scientists and astronomers try to explain the cosmic situation and the vastness of space, and some of them believe that all the glittering stars are different suns. From Bhagavad-gétä, however, we understand that all these stars (nakñatras) are like the moon, in that they reflect the sunshine . They are not independent luminaries. Bhüloka is explained to be that portion of outer space through which the heat and light of the sun extend. Therefore it is natural to conclude that this universe extends in space as far as we can see and encompasses the glittering stars. Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé admitted that to give full details of this expansive material universe would be impossible, but nevertheless he wanted to give the King as much knowledge as he had received through the paramparä system. We should conclude that if one cannot comprehend the material expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one certainly cannot estimate the expansiveness of the spiritual world. The Brahma-saàhitä (BS 5.38) confirms this:"

We should therefore be satisfied with the information obtainable from Vedic sources as spoken by authorities like Çukadeva Gosvämé."
