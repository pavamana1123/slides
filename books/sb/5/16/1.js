            "content": "In this verse it is stated that the planetary system known as Bhü-maëòala extends to the limits of the sunshine. According to modern science, the sunshine reaches earth from a distance of 93,000,000 miles. If we calculate according to this modern information, 93,000,000 miles can be considered the radius of Bhü-maëòala. In the Gäyatré mantra, we chant oà bhür bhuvaù svaù. The word bhür refers to Bhü-maëòala. Tat savitur vareëyam: the sunshine spreads throughout Bhü-maëòala. Therefore the sun is worshipable. The stars, which are known as nakñatra, are not different suns, as modern astronomers suppose. From Bhagavad-gétä  we understand that the stars are similar to the moon (nakñaträëäm ahaà çaçé). Like the moon, the stars reflect the sunshine. Apart from our modern distinguished estimations of where the planetary systems are located, we can understand that the sky and its various planets were studied long, long before Çrémad-Bhägavatam was compiled. Çukadeva Gosvämé explained the location of the planets, and this indicates that the information was known long, long before Çukadeva Gosvämé related it to Mahäräja Parékñit. The location of the various planetary systems was not unknown to the sages who flourished in the Vedic age."
