    "translation": "When the mind is fixed upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His external feature made of the material modes of nature—the gross universal form—it is brought to the platform of pure goodness. In that transcendental position, one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva, who in His subtler form is self-effulgent and beyond the modes of nature. O my lord, please describe vividly how that form, which covers the entire universe, is perceived.",

The universal form is certainly material, but because everything is an expansion of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ultimately nothing is material. Therefore Parékñit Mahäräja's mind was saturated with spiritual consciousness. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has stated:"

When Mahäräja Parékñit was thinking of the universal form of the Lord, his mind was certainly situated on the transcendental platform. Therefore although he might not have had any reason to be concerned with detailed information of the universe, he was thinking of it in relationship with the Supreme Lord, and therefore such geographical knowledge was not material but transcendental. Elsewhere in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  Närada Muni has said, idaà hi viçvaà bhagavän ivetaraù: the entire universe is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although it appears different from Him. Therefore although Parékñit Mahäräja had no need for geographical knowledge of this universe, that knowledge was also spiritual and transcendental because he was thinking of the entire universe as an expansion of the energy of the Lord."

            "content": "In our preaching work also, we deal with so much property and money and so many books bought and sold, but because these dealings all pertain to the Kåñëa consciousness movement, they should never be considered material. That one is absorbed in thoughts of such management does not mean that he is outside of Kåñëa consciousness. If one rigidly observes the regulative principle of chanting sixteen rounds of the mahä-mantra every day, his dealings with the material world for the sake of spreading the Kåñëa consciousness movement are not different from the spiritual cultivation of Kåñëa consciousness."
