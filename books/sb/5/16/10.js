    "translation": "In the same way, west and east of Ilävåta-varña are two great mountains named Mälyavän and Gandhamädana respectively. These two mountains, which are 2,000 yojanas [16,000 miles] high, extend as far as Néla Mountain in the north and Niñadha in the south. They indicate the borders of Ilävåta-varña and also the varñas known as Ketumäla and Bhadräçva.",

While passing over the mountainous region from Mexico to Caracas, we actually saw so many mountains that we doubt whether their height, length and breadth have been properly measured. Therefore, as indicated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam by Çukadeva Gosvämé, we should not try to comprehend the greater mountainous areas of the universe merely by our calculations. Çukadeva Gosvämé has already stated that such calculations would be very difficult even if one had a duration of life like that of Brahmä. We should simply be satisfied with the statements of authorities like Çukadeva Gosvämé and appreciate how the entire cosmic manifestation has been made possible by the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The measurements given herein, such as 10,000 yojanas or 100,000 yojanas, should be considered correct because they have been given by Çukadeva Gosvämé. Our experimental knowledge can neither verify nor disprove the statements of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. We should simply hear these statements from the authorities. If we can appreciate the extensive energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that will benefit us."
