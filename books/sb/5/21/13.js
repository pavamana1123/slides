    "translation": "The chariot of the sun-god has only one wheel, which is known as Saàvatsara. The twelve months are calculated to be its twelve spokes, the six seasons are the sections of its rim, and the three cätur-mäsya periods are its three-sectioned hub. One side of the axle carrying the wheel rests upon the summit of Mount Sumeru, and the other rests upon Mänasottara Mountain. Affixed to the outer end of the axle, the wheel continuously rotates on Mänasottara Mountain like the wheel of an oil-pressing machine.",
