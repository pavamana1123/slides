            "content": "In this chapter the descendants of Bharata Mahäräja and many other kings are described. The son of Mahäräja Bharata was named Sumati. He followed the path of liberation given by Åñabhadeva. Some people mistakenly thought Sumati to be the direct incarnation of Lord Buddha. The son of Sumati was Devatäjit, and his son was Devadyumna. Devadyumna's son was Parameñöhé, and his son was Pratéha. Pratéha was a very great devotee of Lord Viñëu, and he had three sons, named Pratihartä, Prastotä and Udgätä. Pratihartä had two sons, Aja and Bhümä. The son of Bhümä was Udgétha, and the son of Udgétha was Prastäva. The son of Prastäva was Vibhu, and the son of Vibhu was Påthuñeëa, whose son was Nakta. The wife of Nakta, Druti, gave birth to Gaya, who was a very famous and saintly king. Actually King Gaya was a partial incarnation of Lord Viñëu, and because of his great devotion to Lord Viñëu he received the title Mahäpuruña. King Gaya had sons named Citraratha, Sumati and Avarodhana. The son of Citraratha was the emperor Samräö, and his son was Maréci, whose son was Bindu. Bindu's son was Madhu, and Madhu's son was Véravrata. Véravrata's two sons were Manthu and Pramanthu, and the son of Manthu was Bhauvana. The son of Bhauvana was Tvañöä, and the son of Tvañöä was Viraja, who glorified the whole dynasty. Viraja had one hundred sons and one daughter. Of these, the son named Çatajit became very famous."
