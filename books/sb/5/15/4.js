The devotee who is pure and advanced realizes God as He is, Mahäräja Pratéha did so, and due to his direct realization of Lord Viñëu, he propagated self-realization and became a preacher. A real preacher cannot be bogus; he must first of all realize Lord Viñëu as He is. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä , upadekñyanti te jïänaà jïäninas tattva-darçinaù: \"one who has seen the truth can impart knowledge.\" The word tattva-darçé refers to one who has perfectly realized the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a person can become a guru and propound Vaiñëava philosophy all over the world. The paragon of bona fide preachers and guru is King Pratéha."
