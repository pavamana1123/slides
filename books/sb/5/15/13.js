The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Supersoul of everyone, and He is by nature fully pleased. Nonetheless, He came to the arena of Mahäräja Gaya and said, \"I am fully pleased.\"",

If one pours water on the root of a tree, all the branches, twigs, flowers and leaves are nourished. Although the Supreme Lord is self-satisfied, He was so pleased with the behavior of Mahäräja Gaya that He personally came to the sacrificial arena and said, \"I am fully satisfied.\" Who can compare to Mahäräja Gaya?"
