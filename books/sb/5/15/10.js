    "translation": "All the chaste and honest daughters of Mahäräja Dakña, such as Çraddhä, Maitré and Dayä, whose blessings were always effective, bathed Mahäräja Gaya with sanctified water. Indeed, they were very satisfied with Mahäräja Gaya. The planet earth personified came as a cow, and, as though she saw her calf, she delivered milk profusely when she saw all the good qualities of Mahäräja Gaya. In other words, Mahäräja Gaya was able to derive all benefits from the earth and thus satisfy the desires of his citizens. However, he personally had no desire.",

A cow delivers milk in the presence of her calf; similarly the cow, or earth, fulfilled the desires of Mahäräja Gaya, who was able to utilize all the resources of the earth to benefit his citizens. This was possible because he was bathed in sanctified water by the honest daughters of Dakña. Unless a king or ruler is blessed by authorities, he cannot rule the citizens very satisfactorily. Through the good qualities of the ruler, the citizens become very happy and well qualified."
