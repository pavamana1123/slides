    "translation": "Although King Gaya had no personal desire for sense gratification, all his desires were fulfilled by virtue of his performance of Vedic rituals. All the kings with whom Mahäräja Gaya had to fight were forced to fight on religious principles. They were very satisfied with his fighting, and they would present all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, all the brähmaëas in his kingdom were very satisfied with King Gaya's munificent charities. Consequently the brähmaëas contributed a sixth of their pious activities for King Gaya's benefit in the next life.",

            "content": "As a kñatriya or emperor, Mahäräja Gaya sometimes had to fight with subordinate kings to maintain his government, but the subordinate kings were not dissatisfied with him because they knew that he fought for religious principles. Consequently they accepted their subordination and offered all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, the brähmaëas who performed Vedic rituals were so satisfied with the King that they very readily agreed to part with a sixth of their pious activities for his benefit in the next life. Thus the brähmaëas and kñatriyas were all satisfied with Mahäräja Gaya because of his proper administration. In other words, Mahäräja Gaya satisfied the kñatriya kings by his fighting and satisfied the brähmaëas by his charities. The vaiçyas were also encouraged by kind words and affectionate dealings, and due to Mahäräja Gaya's constant sacrifices, the çüdras were satisfied by sumptuous food and charity. In this way Mahäräja Gaya kept all the citizens very satisfied. When brähmaëas and saintly persons are honored, they part with their pious activities, giving them to those who honor them and render them service. Therefore, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä , tad viddhi praëipätena paripraçnena sevayä: one should try to approach a spiritual master submissively and render service unto him."
