    "translation": "Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: The son of Mahäräja Bharata known as Sumati followed the path of Åñabhadeva, but some unscrupulous people imagined him to be Lord Buddha himself. These people, who were actually atheistic and of bad character, took up the Vedic principles in an imaginary, infamous way to support their activities. Thus these sinful people accepted Sumati as Lord Buddhadeva and propagated the theory that everyone should follow the principles of Sumati. In this way they were carried away by mental concoction.",

            "content": "Those who are Äryans strictly follow the Vedic principles, but in this age of Kali a community has sprung up known as the ärya-samäja, which is ignorant of the import of the Vedas in the paramparä system. Their leaders decry all bona fide äcäryas, and they pose themselves as the real followers of the Vedic principles. These äcäryas who do not follow the Vedic principles are presently known as the ärya-samäjas, or the Jains. Not only do they not follow the Vedic principles, but they have no relationship with Lord Buddha. Imitating the behavior of Sumati, they claim to be the descendants of Åñabhadeva. Those who are Vaiñëavas carefully avoid their company because they are ignorant of the path of the Vedas. In Bhagavad-gétä  Kåñëa says, vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: \"The real purpose of the Vedas is to understand Me.\" This is the injunction of all Vedic literatures. One who does not know the greatness of Lord Kåñëa cannot be accepted as an Äryan. Lord Buddha, an incarnation of Lord Kåñëa, adopted a particular means to propagate the philosophy of bhägavata-dharma. He preached almost exclusively among atheists. Atheists do not want any God, and Lord Buddha therefore said that there is no God, but he adopted the means to instruct his followers for their benefit. Therefore he preached in a duplicitous way, saying that there is no God. Nonetheless, he himself was an incarnation of God."
