    "translation": "In the womb of his wife, Åñikulyä, King Bhümä begot a son named Udgétha. From Udgétha's wife, Devakulyä, a son named Prastäva was born, and Prastäva begot a son named Vibhu through his wife, Niyutsä. In the womb of his wife, Raté, Vibhu begot a son named Påthuñeëa. Påthuñeëa begot a son named Nakta in the womb of his wife, named Äküti. Nakta's wife was Druti, and from her womb the great King Gaya was born. Gaya was very famous and pious; he was the best of saintly kings. Lord Viñëu and His expansions, who are meant to protect the universe, are always situated in the transcendental mode of goodness, known as viçuddha-sattva. Being the direct expansion of Lord Viñëu, King Gaya was also situated in the viçuddha-sattva. Because of this, Mahäräja Gaya was fully equipped with transcendental knowledge. Therefore he was called Mahäpuruña.",

            "content": "From this verse it appears that the incarnations of God are various. Some are part and parcel of the direct expansions, and some are direct expansions of Lord Viñëu. A direct incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called aàça or sväàça, whereas an incarnation from aàça is called kalä. Among the kaläs there are the vibhinnäàça-jévas, or living entities. These are counted among the jéva-tattvas. Those who come directly from Lord Viñëu are called viñëu-tattva and are sometimes designated as Mahäpuruña. Another name for Kåñëa is Mahäpuruña, and a devotee is sometimes called mahä-pauruñika."
