Those who are ruling the world at the present moment should take lessons from King Gaya, King Yudhiñöhira and King Påthu and rule the citizens so that they will be happy, presently the governments are levying taxes without improving the citizens in any cultural, religious, social or political way. According to the Vedas, this is not recommended."
