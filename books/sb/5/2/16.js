I do not want to give up your company, for my mind and eyes are fixed upon you and cannot be drawn away. O woman with beautiful raised breasts, I am your follower. You may take me wherever you like, and your friends may also follow me.",

            "content": "Now Ägnédhra frankly admits his weakness. He was attracted to Pürvacitti, and therefore before she could say, \"But I have no business with you,\" he expressed his desire to be united with her. He was so attracted that he was ready to go anywhere, hell or heaven, in her company. When one is absorbed in lust and the influence of sex, one surrenders to the feet of a woman without reservations. Çréla Madhväcärya remarks in this connection that when one engages in joking and talking like a crazy person, one may say anything and everything, but his words will be meaningless."
