    "translation": "O best among those performing austerities, where did you get this wonderful beauty that dismantles the austerities performed by others? Where have you learned this art?

            "content": "Ägnédhra appreciated the wonderful beauty of Pürvacitti. Indeed, he was surprised to see such exceptional beauty, which must have been the result of past austerities and penances. He therefore asked the girl whether she had achieved such beauty just to break the penances and austerities of others. He thought that Lord Brahmä, the creator of the universe, might have been pleased with him and might therefore have sent her to become his wife. He requested Pürvacitti to become his wife so that together they could perform austerities and penances in family life. In other words, a suitable wife helps her husband perform penances and austerities in household life if both of them are on the same elevated platform of spiritual understanding. Without spiritual understanding, husband and wife cannot be equally situated. Lord Brahmä, the creator of the universe, is interested in good progeny. Therefore unless he is pleased, one cannot get a suitable wife. In fact, Lord Brahmä is worshiped in marriage ceremonies. In India even today, wedding invitations are still issued with a picture of Lord Brahmä on the face of the card."
