    "translation": "The Prince mistakenly addressed the Apsarä: O best of saintly persons, who are you? Why are you on this hill, and what do you want to do? Are you one of the illusory potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? You seem to be carrying two bows without strings, What is the reason you carry these bows? Is it for some purpose of your own or for the sake of a friend? Perhaps you carry them to kill the mad animals in this forest.",

He therefore asked her whether they were to be used for her own purposes or for the sake of someone else. Her eyebrows were like bows meant to kill animals in the forest. This material world is like a great forest, and its inhabitants are like forest animals such as deer and tigers meant to be killed. The killers are the eyebrows of beautiful women. Captivated by the beauty of the fair sex, all the men of the world are killed by bows without strings, but cannot see how they are killed by mäyä. It is a fact, however, that they are being killed (bhütvä bhütvä praléyate). By dint of his tapasya, Ägnédhra could understand how mäyä acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

They are killed by mäyä. However, one who is apramatta, a sane, sober person, a dhéra, knows very well that a human being's primary duty is to render service to the Supreme Person. Mäyä is always ready to kill those who are pramatta with her invisible bows and arrows. Ägnédhra questioned Pürvacitti about this."
