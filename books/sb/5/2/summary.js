            "content": "In this chapter, the character of Mahäräja Ägnédhra is described. When Mahäräja Priyavrata went off for spiritual realization, his son Ägnédhra became the ruler of Jambüdvépa, in accordance with Mahäräja Priyavrata's instructions, and maintained its residents with the same affection a father feels for his sons. Once Mahäräja Ägnédhra desired to have a son, and therefore he entered a cave of Mandara Mountain to practice austerity. Understanding his desire, Lord Brahmä sent a celestial girl named Pürvacitti to Ägnédhra's hermitage. After dressing herself very attractively, she presented herself before him with various feminine movements, and Ägnédhra was naturally attracted to her. The girl's actions, expressions, smile, sweet words and moving eyes were fascinating to him. Ägnédhra was expert in flattery. Thus he attracted the celestial girl, who was pleased to accept him as her husband because of his mellifluous words. She enjoyed royal happiness with Ägnédhra for many years before returning to her abode in the heavenly planets. In her womb Ägnédhra begot nine sons-Näbhi, Kiàpuruña, Harivarña, Ilävåta, Ramyaka, Hiraëmaya, Kuru, Bhadräçva and Ketumäla. He gave them nine islands with names corresponding to theirs. Ägnédhra, however, his senses unsatisfied, was always thinking of his celestial wife, and therefore in his next life he was born in her celestial planet. After the death of Ägnédhra, his nine sons married nine daughters of Meru named Merudevé, Pratirüpä, Ugradaàñöré, Latä, Ramyä, Çyämä, Näré, Bhadrä and Devavéti."
