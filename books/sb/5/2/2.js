    "translation": "Desiring to get a perfect son and become an inhabitant of Pitåloka, Mahäräja Ägnédhra once worshiped Lord Brahmä, the master of those in charge of material creation. He went to a valley of Mandara Hill, where the damsels of the heavenly planets come down to stroll. There he collected garden flowers and other necessary paraphernalia and then engaged in severe austerities and worship.",

            "content": "Since Mahäräja Priyavrata was a great devotee, how could he have begotten a son who desired to be transferred to Pitåloka? Lord Kåñëa says, pitṟn yänti pitå-vratäù: persons who desire to go to Pitåloka are transferred there. Similarly, yänti mad-yäjino 'pi mäm:  persons who desire to be transferred to the spiritual planets, Vaikuëöhalokas, can also go there. Since Mahäräja Ägnédhra was the son of a Vaiñëava, he should have desired to be transferred to the spiritual world, Vaikuëöhaloka. Why, then, did he desire to be transferred to Pitåloka? In answer to this, Gosvämé Giridhara, one of the Bhägavatam commentators, remarks that Ägnédhra was born when Mahäräja Priyavrata was infatuated by lusty desires. This may be accepted as a fact because sons are begotten with different mentalities according to the time of their conception. According to the Vedic system, therefore, before a child is conceived, the garbhädhäna-saàskära is performed. This ceremony molds the mentality of the father in such a way that when he plants his seed in the womb of his wife, he will beget a child whose mind will be completely saturated with a devotional attitude. At the present moment, however, there are no such garbhädhäna-saàskäras, and therefore people generally have a lusty attitude when they beget children. Especially in this age of Kali, there are no garbhädhäna ceremonies; everyone enjoys sex with his wife like a cat or dog. Therefore according to çästric injunctions, almost all the people of this age belong to the çüdra category. Of course, although Mahäräja Ägnédhra had a desire to be transferred to Pitåloka, this does not mean that his mentality was that of a çüdra; he was a kñatriya."

            "content": "Mahäräja Ägnédhra desired to be transferred to Pitåloka, and therefore he needed a wife because anyone desiring to be transferred to Pitåloka must leave behind a good son to offer yearly piëòa, or prasäda from Lord Viñëu. To have a good son, Mahäräja Ägnédhra wanted a wife from a family of demigods. Therefore he went to Mandara Hill. where the women of the demigods generally come, to worship Lord Brahmä. In Bhagavad-gétä  it is said, käìkñantaù karmaëäà siddhià yajanta iha devatäù: materialists who want quick results in the material world worship demigods. This is also confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Çré-aiçvarya-prajepsavaù: those who desire beautiful wives, substantial wealth and many sons worship the demigods, but an intelligent devotee, instead of being entangled by the happiness of this material world in the form of a beautiful wife, material opulence and children, desires to be immediately transferred back home, back to Godhead. Thus he worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu."
