    "translation": "Because of drinking the breast milk of their mother, the nine sons of Ägnédhra naturally had strong, well-built bodies. Their father gave them each a kingdom in a different part of Jambüdvépa. The kingdoms were named according to the names of the sons. Thus the sons of Ägnédhra ruled the kingdoms they received from their father.",

            "content": "The äcäryas specifically mention that in this verse the words mätuù anugrahät (\"by the mercy of their mother\") refer to the breast milk of their mother. In India it is a common belief that if a baby is fed his mother's milk for at least six months, his body will be very strong. Besides that, it is mentioned herein that all the sons of Ägnédhra were endowed with the nature of their mother. Bhagavad-gétä  also declares, stréñu duñöäsu värñëeya jäyate varëa-saìkaraù: when women are polluted, varëa-saìkara, unqualified children, are generated, and when the varëa-saìkara population increases, the entire world becomes hellish. Therefore, according to Manu-saàhitä, a woman needs a great deal of protection in order to remain pure and chaste so that her children can be fully engaged for the benefit of human society."
