    "translation": "My dear friend, what do you eat to maintain your body? Because you are chewing betel, a pleasing scent is emanating from your mouth. This proves that you always eat the remnants of food offered to Viñëu. Indeed, you must also be an expansion of Lord Viñëu's body. Your face is as beautiful as a pleasing lake. Your jeweled earrings resemble two brilliant sharks with unblinking eyes like those of Viñëu, and your own eyes resemble two restless fish. Simultaneously, therefore, two sharks and two restless fish are swimming in the lake of your face. Besides them, the white rows of your teeth seem like rows of very beautiful swans in the water, and your scattered hair resembles swarms of bumblebees following the beauty of your face.",

            "content": "The devotees of Lord Viñëu are also His expansions. They are called vibhinnäàça. Lord Viñëu is offered all kinds of sacrificial ingredients, and because devotees always eat prasäda, the remnants of His food, the scent of sacrificial ingredients emanates not only from Viñëu but also from the devotees who eat the remnants of His food or the food of His devotees. Ägnédhra considered Pürvacitti an expansion of Lord Viñëu because of the pleasing scent of her body. Aside from that, because of her jeweled earrings, shaped like sharks, because of her scattered hair, resembling bumblebees mad after the scent of her body, and because of the white rows of her teeth, which resembled swans, Ägnédhra compared Pürvacitti's face to a beautiful lake decorated with lotus flowers, fish, swans and bumblebees."
