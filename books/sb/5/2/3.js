In Bhagavad-gétä, He is also addressed by Arjuna as puruñam ädyam, the original person, and He is called Bhagavän. In this verse, however, we see that Lord Brahmä is described as bhagavän ädi-puruñaù. The reason he is called bhagavän is that he fully represents the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is the first-born creature in this universe. Lord Brahmä could understand Mahäräja Ägnédhra's desire because he is as powerful as Lord Viñëu. As Lord Viñëu, situated as Paramätmä, can understand the desire of the living entity, so Lord Brahmä can also understand the living entity's desire, for Viñëu, as a via medium, informs him. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam , tene brahma hådä ya ädi-kavaye: Lord Viñëu informs Lord Brahmä of everything from within his heart. Because Mahäräja Ägnédhra specifically worshiped Lord Brahmä, Lord Brahmä was pleased, and he sent Pürvacitti, the Apsarä, to satisfy him."
