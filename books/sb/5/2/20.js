For example, after Menakä, the celestial woman who had come to delude Viçvämitra Muni, gave birth to the child Çakuntalä, she left both the child and her husband and returned to the heavenly planets. Pürvacitti did not remain permanently with Mahäräja Ägnédhra. After cooperating in his household affairs, she left Mahäräja Ägnédhra and all nine sons and returned to Brahmä to worship him."
