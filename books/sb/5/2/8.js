    "translation": "Then Ägnédhra observed the glancing eyes of Pürvacitti and said: My dear friend, you have two very powerful arrows, namely your glancing eyes. Those arrows have feathers like the petals of a lotus flower. Although they have no shafts, they are very beautiful, and they have very sharp, piercing points. They appear very peaceful, and thus it seems that they will not be shot at anyone. You must be loitering in this forest to shoot those arrows at someone, but I cannot understand whom. My intelligence is dull, and I cannot combat you. Indeed, no one can equal you in prowess, and therefore I pray that your prowess will be for my good fortune.",

Although her eyes were as beautiful as lotuses, they were simultaneously like shaftless arrows, and Ägnédhra was therefore afraid of them. He hoped that her glances upon him would be favorable because he was already captivated, and the more captivated he became, the more impossible it would be for him to remain without her. Ägnédhra therefore prayed to Pürvacitti that her glances at him would be auspicious, not futile. In other words, he prayed that she would become his wife."
