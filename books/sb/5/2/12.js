Such attractive features, he thought, must be due to the severe austerities performed there. Ägnédhra addressed the girl as suhåttama, the best friend, so that she would not refuse to take him there. Not only was Ägnédhra captivated by the girl's raised breasts; he was also attracted by her sweet speech. Nectar seemed to emanate from her mouth, and therefore he was increasingly surprised."
