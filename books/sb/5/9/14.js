    "translation": "The followers and servants of the dacoit chief considered Jaòa Bharata to possess qualities quite suitable for a man-animal, and they decided that he was a perfect choice for sacrifice. Their faces bright with happiness, they bound him with ropes and brought him to the temple of the goddess Kälé.",

Their business is to plunder the wealthy, and to become successful they offer an animalistic man before the goddess Kälé. It should be noted that they never sacrifice an intelligent man before the goddess. In the body of a brähmaëa, Bharata Mahäräja appeared deaf and dumb, yet he was the most intelligent man in the world. Nonetheless, being completely surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he remained in that condition and did not protest being brought before the deity for slaughter. As we have learned from the previous verses, he was very strong and could have very easily avoided being bound with ropes, but he did not do anything. He simply depended on the Supreme Personality of Godhead for his protection. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura describes surrender unto the Supreme Lord in this way:"
