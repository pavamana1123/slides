    "translation": "The brähmaëa father's mind was always filled with affection for his son, Jaòa Bharata [Bharata Mahäräja]. Therefore he was always attached to Jaòa Bharata. Because Jaòa Bharata was unfit to enter the gåhastha-äçrama, he simply executed the purificatory process up to the end of the brahmacarya-äçrama. Although Jaòa Bharata was unwilling to accept his father's instructions, the brähmaëa nonetheless instructed him in how to keep clean and how to wash, thinking that the son should be taught by the father.",

He knew perfectly well of the results of fruitive activity and the results of devotional service. In the body of a brähmaëa, Mahäräja Bharata was completely absorbed in devotional service within; therefore it was not at all necessary for him to execute the regulative principles of fruitive activity. As confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam: svanuñöhitasya dharmasya saàsiddhir hari-toñaëam . One has to satisfy Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the perfection of the regulative principles of fruitive activity. Besides that, it is stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam:"

            "content": "\"Duties [dharma] executed by men, regardless of occupation, are only so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message of the Supreme Lord.\"  These karma-käëòa activities are required as long as one has not developed Kåñëa consciousness. If one is developed in Kåñëa consciousness, there is no need to execute the prior regulative principles of karma-käëòa. Çréla Mädhavendra Puré said, \"O regulative principles of karma-käëòa, please excuse me. I cannot follow all these regulative principles, for I am fully engaged in devotional service.\" He expressed the desire to sit somewhere beneath a tree and continue chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. Consequently he did not execute all the regulative principles. Similarly, Haridäsa Öhäkura was born in a Mohammedan family. From the very beginning of his life he was never trained in the karma-käëòa system, but because he was always chanting the holy name of the Lord, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu accepted him as nämäcärya, the authority in chanting the holy name. As Jaòa Bharata, Bharata Mahäräja was always engaged in devotional service within his mind. Since he had executed the regulative principles continuously for three lives, he was not interested in continuing to execute them, although his brähmaëa father wanted him to do so."
