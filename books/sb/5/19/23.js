    "translation": "A short life in the land of Bharata-varña is preferable to a life achieved in Brahmaloka for millions and billions of years because even if one is elevated to Brahmaloka, he must return to repeated birth and death. Although life in Bhärata-varña, in a lower planetary system, is very short, one who lives there can elevate himself to full Kåñëa consciousness and achieve the highest perfection, even in this short life, by fully surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Thus one attains Vaikuëöhaloka, where there is neither anxiety nor repeated birth in a material body.",

One should certainly give up all other propositions and surrender to Kåñëa. Kåñëa will then immediately take charge and relieve one of the results of past sinful life (ahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo mokñayiñyämi mä çucaù ). One should go directly to Kåñëa and engage in His service. This is the best opportunity offered to the inhabitants of Bhärata-varña. One who is fit to return home, back to Godhead, is no longer liable to the results of karma, good or bad."
