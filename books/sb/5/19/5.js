    "translation": "It was ordained that Rävaëa, chief of the Räkñasas, could not be killed by anyone but a man, and for this reason Lord Rämacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared in the form of a human being. Lord Rämacandra's mission, however, was not only to kill Rävaëa but also to teach mortal beings that material happiness centered around sex life or centered around one's wife is the cause of many miseries. He is the self-sufficient Supreme Personality of Godhead, and nothing is lamentable for Him. Therefore why else could He be subjected to tribulations by the kidnapping of mother Sétä?",

Thus they enjoy sex again and again, although that sex is followed by many tribulations. This is a warning to devotees. To teach this lesson to devotees and to human society in general, Lord Çré Rämacandra, although the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, underwent a series of tribulations because He accepted a wife, mother Sétä. Lord Rämacandra underwent these austerities, of course, only to instruct us; actually He never has any reason to lament for anything."

            "content": "Another aspect of the Lord's instructions is that one who accepts a wife must be a faithful husband and give her full protection. Human society is divided into two classes of men—those who strictly follow the religious principles and those who are devotees. By His personal example, Lord Rämacandra wanted to instruct both of them how to fully adopt the discipline of the religious system and how to be a beloved and dutiful husband. Otherwise He had no reason to undergo apparent tribulations. One who strictly follows religious principles must not neglect to provide all facilities for the complete protection of his wife. There may be some suffering because of this, but one must nevertheless endure it. That is the duty of a faithful husband. By His personal example, Lord Rämacandra demonstrated this duty. Lord Rämacandra could have produced hundreds and thousands of Sétäs from His pleasure energy, but just to show the duty of a faithful husband, He not only rescued Sétä from the hands of Rävaëa but also killed Rävaëa and all the members of his family."

Although he may appear to suffer material pains, his position is called transcendental bliss in separation (viraha). The emotions a lover and beloved feel when separated from one another are actually very blissful, although apparently painful. Therefore the separation of Lord Rämacandra from Sétädevé, as well as the consequent tribulation they suffered, is but another display of transcendental bliss. That is the opinion of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura."
