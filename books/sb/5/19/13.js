Whereas materialists are absorbed in material thoughts and activities, devotees, on the contrary, are always absorbed in thoughts of Kåñëa and Kåñëa's activities. Therefore they are already on the platform of liberation. One has to think of Kåñëa with full absorption at the time of death. Then he will certainly return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt."
