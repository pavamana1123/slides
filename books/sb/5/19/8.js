    "translation": "Therefore, whether one is a demigod or a demon, a man or a creature other than man, such as a beast or bird, everyone should worship Lord Rämacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appears on this earth just like a human being. There is no need of great austerities or penances to worship the Lord, for He accepts even a small service offered by His devotee. Thus He is satisfied, and as soon as He is satisfied, the devotee is successful. Indeed, Lord Çré Rämacandra brought all the devotees of Ayodhyä back home, back to Godhead [Vaikuëöha].",

            "content": "Lord Çré Rämacandra is so kind and merciful to His devotees that He is very easily satisfied by a little service rendered by anyone, human or not. This is the special advantage of worshiping Lord Rämacandra, and there is the same advantage in worshiping Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Lord Kåñëa and Lord Rämacandra, in the manner of kñatriyas, sometimes showed Their mercy by killing asuras, but Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu awarded love of God without difficulty even to the asuras. All the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead—but especially Lord Rämacandra, Lord Kåñëa and, later, Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu—delivered many of the living entities present before Them, indeed almost all of them. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is therefore represented in the six-armed form of ñaò-bhüja-mürti, which is a combination of Lord Rämacandra, Lord Kåñëa and Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. The best purpose of human life can be fulfilled by worshiping the ñaò-bhüja-mürti, the form of the Lord with six arms-two arms of Rämacandra, two arms of Kåñëa and two arms of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu."
