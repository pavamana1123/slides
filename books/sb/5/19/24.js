            "content": "Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is always accompanied by His very confidential associates such as Çré Nityänanda, Çré Gadädhara and Çré Advaita and by many devotees like Çréväsa. They are always engaged in chanting the name of the Lord and are always describing Lord Kåñëa. Therefore this is the best among all the places in the universe. The Kåñëa consciousness movement has established its center in Mäyäpur, the birthsite of Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, to give men the great opportunity to go there and perform a constant festival of saìkértana-yajïa, as recommended herein (yajïeça-makhä mahotsaväù) and to distribute prasäda to millions of hungry people hankering for spiritual emancipation. This is the mission of the Kåñëa consciousness movement. Caitanya-bhägavata confirms this as follows: \"One should not desire to be elevated even to a place in the heavenly planetary systems if it has no propaganda to expand the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no trace of Vaiñëavas, pure devotees of the Lord, and no festivals for spreading Kåñëa consciousness. It would be better to live perpetually cramped within the airtight bag of a mother's womb, where one can at least remember the lotus feet of the Lord, than to live in a place where there is no opportunity to remember His lotus feet. I pray not to be allowed to take birth in such a condemned place.\" Similarly, in Caitanya-caritämåta, Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja Gosvämé says that since Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is the inaugurator of the saìkértana movement, anyone who performs saìkértana to please the Lord is very, very glorious. Such a person has perfect intelligence, whereas others are in the ignorance of material existence. Of all the sacrifices mentioned in the Vedic literatures, the performance of saìkértana-yajïa is the best. Even the performance of one hundred açvamedha sacrifices cannot compare to the sacrifice of saìkértana. According to the author of Çré Caitanya-caritämåta, if one compares saìkértana-yajïa to other yajïas, he is a päñaëòé, an infidel, and is liable to be punished by Yamaräja. There are many Mäyävädés who think that the performance of saìkértana-yajïa is a pious activity similar to the performance of the açvamedha-yajïa and other such pious functions, but this is a näma-aparädha. Chanting of the holy name of Näräyaëa and chanting of other names are never equal, despite what Mäyävädés think."
