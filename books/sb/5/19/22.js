    "translation": "The demigods continue: After performing the very difficult tasks of executing Vedic ritualistic sacrifices, undergoing austerities, observing vows and giving charity, we have achieved this position as inhabitants of the heavenly planets. But what is the value of this achievement? Here we are certainly very engaged in material sense gratification, and therefore we can hardly remember the lotus feet of Lord Näräyaëa. Indeed, because of our excessive sense gratification, we have almost forgotten His lotus feet.",

However, what is the use of such great attainments? As stated in Bhagavad-gétä . One should try to return home, back to Godhead, to the Vaikuëöha planets—or to the topmost Vaikuëöha planet, Goloka Våndävana—to live eternally in full, blissful knowledge in the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
