The inhabitants of Kimpuruña-varña are fortunate because they worship Lord Rämacandra with His faithful servant Hanumän. Lord Rämacandra exemplifies an incarnation of Godhead who descends for the mission of pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm  — protecting the devotees and destroying the miscreants. Lord Rämacandra exhibits the actual purpose of an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the devotees take the opportunity to offer loving transcendental service to Him. One should surrender fully to the Lord, forgetting one's so-called material happiness, opulence and education, which are not at all useful for pleasing the Lord. The Lord is pleased only by the process of surrender unto Him."

            "content": "When Devarñi Närada descended to instruct Särvaëi Manu, he described the opulence of Bhärata-varña, India. Särvaëi Manu and the inhabitants of Bhärata-varña engage in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the origin of creation, maintenance and annihilation and who is always worshiped by self-realized souls. In the planet known as Bhärata-varña there are many rivers and mountains, as there are in other tracts of land, yet Bhärata-varña has special significance because in this tract of land there exists the Vedic principle of varëäçrama-dharma, which divides society into four varëas and four äçramas. Furthermore, Närada Muni's opinion is that even if there is some temporary disturbance in the execution of the varëäçrama-dharma principles, they can be revived at any moment. The effect of adhering to the institution of varëäçrama is gradual elevation to the spiritual platform and liberation from material bondage. By following the principles of varëäçrama-dharma, one gets the opportunity to associate with devotees. Such association gradually awakens one's dormant propensity to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead and frees one from all the basic principles of sinful life. One then gets the opportunity to offer unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Lord, Väsudeva. Because of this opportunity, the inhabitants of Bhärata-varña are praised even in the heavenly planets. Even in the topmost planet of this universe, Brahmaloka, the position of Bhärata-varña is discussed with great relish."

            "content": "All the conditioned living entities are evolving within the universe in different planets and different species of life. Thus one may be elevated to Brahmaloka, but then one must again descend to earth, as confirmed in Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä (äbrahma-bhuvanäl lokäù punar ävartino 'rjuna ). If those who live in Bhärata-varña rigidly follow the principles of varëäçrama-dharma and develop their dormant Kåñëa consciousness, they need not return to this material world after death. Any place where one cannot hear about the Supreme Personality of Godhead from realized souls, even if it be Brahmaloka, is not very congenial to the living entity. If one who has taken birth in the land of Bhärata-varña as a human being does not take advantage of the opportunity for spiritual elevation, his position is certainly the most miserable. In the land known as Bhäratavarña, even if one is a sarva-käma-bhakta, a devotee seeking the fulfillment of some material desire, he is freed from all material desires by his association with devotees, and ultimately he becomes a pure devotee and returns home, back to Godhead, without difficulty."
