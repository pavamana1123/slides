    "translation": "Therefore, O Lord, O Transcendence, kindly help us by giving us the power to execute bhakti-yoga so that we can control our restless minds and fix them upon You. We are all infected by Your illusory energy; therefore we are very attached to the body, which is full of stool and urine, and to anything related with the body. Except for devotional service, there is no way to give up this attachment. Therefore kindly bestow upon us this benediction.",

The perfect yoga system consists of always thinking of Kåñëa, always engaging in devotional service, always worshiping Kåñëa and always offering obeisances unto Him. Unless we practice this yoga system, our illusory attachment for this bad body, which is full of stool and urine, is impossible to give up. The perfection of yoga consists of giving up attachment for this body and bodily relationships and transferring that attachment to Kåñëa. We are very attached to material enjoyment, but when we transfer that same attachment to Kåñëa, we traverse the path of liberation. One has to practice this yoga system and none other."
