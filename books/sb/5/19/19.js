    "translation": "The people who take birth in this tract of land are divided according to the qualities of material nature—the modes of goodness [sattva-guëa], passion [rajo-guëa], and ignorance [tamo-guëa]. Some of them are born as exalted personalities, some are ordinary human beings, and some are extremely abominable, for in Bhärata—varña one takes birth exactly according to one's past karma. If one's position is ascertained by a bona fide spiritual master and one is properly trained to engage in the service of Lord Viñëu according to the four social divisions [brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra] and the four spiritual divisions [brahmacäré, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa], one's life becomes perfect.",

There is no other way to satisfy the Lord.\" In the land of Bhärata-varña, the institution of varëäçrama-dharma may be easily adopted. At the present moment, certain demoniac sections of the population of Bhäratavarña are disregarding the system of varëäçrama-dharma. Because there is no institution to teach people how to become brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras or brahmacärés, gåhasthas, vänaprasthas and sannyäsés, these demons want a classless society. This is resulting in chaotic conditions. In the name of secular government, unqualified people are taking the supreme governmental posts. No one is being trained to act according to the principles of varëäçrama-dharma, and thus people are becoming increasingly degraded and are heading in the direction of animal life. The real aim of life is liberation, but unfortunately the opportunity for liberation is being denied to people in general, and therefore their human lives are being spoiled. The Kåñëa consciousness movement, however, is being propagated all over the world to reestablish the varëäçrama-dharma system and thus save human society from gliding down to hellish life."
