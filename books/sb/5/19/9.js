    "translation": "[Çukadeva Gosvämé continued:] The glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are inconceivable. He has appeared in the form of Nara-Näräyaëa in the land of Bhärata-varña, at the place known as Badarikäçrama, to favor His devotees by teaching them religion, knowledge, renunciation, spiritual power, sense control and freedom from false ego. He is advanced in the opulence of spiritual assets, and He engages in executing austerity until the end of this millennium. This is the process of self-realization.",

            "content": "People in India may visit the temple of Nara-Näräyaëa at Badarikäçrama just to learn how the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Nara-Näräyaëa engages in austerities to teach the people of the world how to achieve self-realization. It is impossible to realize oneself simply by absorbing oneself in speculation and material activities. One must be very serious about self-realization and the practice of austerity. Unfortunately, the people of this age of Kali do not even know the meaning of austerity. Under these circumstances, the Lord has appeared as Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu to bestow upon the fallen souls the easiest method of self-realization, technically called ceto-darpaëa-märjanam , cleansing of the dirt from the core of one's heart. This method is extremely simple. Anyone can chant the glorious kåñëa-saìkértana—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. In this age there are different forms of so-called advanced scientific knowledge, such as anthropology, Marxism, Freudianism, nationalism and industrialism, but if we work very hard under their guidance instead of adopting the process practiced by Nara-Näräyaëa, we shall waste our valuable human form of life. Thus we shall certainly be cheated and misled."
