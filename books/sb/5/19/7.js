    "translation": "One cannot establish a friendship with the Supreme Lord Rämacandra on the basis of material qualities such as one's birth in an aristocratic family, one's personal beauty, one's eloquence, one's sharp intelligence or one's superior race or nation. None of these qualifications is actually a prerequisite for friendship with Lord Çré Rämacandra. Otherwise how is it possible that although we uncivilized inhabitants of the forest have not taken noble births, although we have no physical beauty and although we cannot speak like gentlemen, Lord Rämacandra has nevertheless accepted us as friends?",

The prefix a means \"not,\" and kiïcana \"something of this material world.\" One may be very proud of his prestigious position, material wealth, beauty, education and so on, but although these are certainly good qualifications in material dealings, they are not necessary for achieving friendship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who possesses all these material qualities is expected to become a devotee, and when he actually does, the qualities are properly utilized. Those who are puffed up by a high birth, wealth, education and personal beauty (janmaiçvarya-çruta-çré ). One's devotion and sincere desire to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead are the only qualifications. Rüpa Gosvämé has also said that the price for achieving God's favor is simply one's sincere eagerness to have it (laulyam ekaà mülyam). In the Caitanya-bhägavata it is said:"

One cannot attain Lord Kåñëa by any amount of wealth, followers, or learning. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is controlled only by pure devotion. \"Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu had a very sincere devotee whose name was Kholävecä Çrédhara and whose only business was to sell pots made of the skin of banana trees. Whatever income he had, he used fifty percent for the worship of mother Ganges, and with the other fifty percent he provided for his necessities. On the whole, he was so very poor that he lived in a cottage that had a broken roof with many holes in it. He could not afford brass utensils, and therefore he drank water from an iron pot. Nevertheless, he was a great devotee of Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. He is a typical example of how a poor man with no material possessions can become a most exalted devotee of the Lord. The conclusion is that one cannot attain shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa or Çré Caitanya Gosäïi through material opulence; that shelter is attainable only by pure devotional service."
