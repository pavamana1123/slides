    "translation": "In his own book, known as Närada Païcarätra, Bhagavän Närada has very vividly described how to work to achieve the ultimate goal of life—devotion—through knowledge and through execution of the mystic yoga system. He has also described the glories of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The great sage Närada instructed the tenets of this transcendental literature to Sävarëi Manu in order to teach those inhabitants of Bhärata-varña who strictly follow the principles of varëäçrama-dharma how to achieve the devotional service of the Lord. Thus Närada Muni, along with the other inhabitants of Bhärata-varña, always engages in the service of Nara-Näräyaëa, and he chants as follows.",

People should take advantage of the opportunity afforded by Bhärata-varña, and this is especially so for those who are following the principles of varëäçrama-dharma. If we do not take to the principles of varëäçrama-dharma by accepting the four social orders (brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra) and the four orders of spiritual life (brahmacäré, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa), there can be no question of success in life. Unfortunately, because of the influence of Kali-yuga, everything is now being lost. The inhabitants of Bhärata-varña are gradually becoming degraded mlecchas and yavanas. How then will they teach others? Therefore, this Kåñëa consciousness movement has been started not only for the inhabitants of Bhärata-varña but for all the people of the world, as announced by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. There is still time, and if the inhabitants of Bhärata-varña take this movement of Kåñëa consciousness seriously, the entire world will be saved from gliding down to a hellish condition. The Kåñëa consciousness movement follows the process of païcarätrika-vidhi and that of bhägavata-vidhi simultaneously, so that people can take advantage of the movement and make their lives successful."
