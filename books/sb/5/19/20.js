    "translation": "After many, many births, when the results of one's pious activities mature, one gets an opportunity to associate with pure devotees. Then one is able to cut the knot of bondage to ignorance, which bound him because of varied fruitive activities. As a result of associating with devotees, one gradually renders service to Lord Väsudeva, who is transcendental, free from attachment to the material world, beyond the mind and words, and independent of everything else. That bhakti-yoga, devotional service to Lord Väsudeva, is the real path of liberation.",

He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.\" Devotional service is actual liberation. When one is attracted by the beauty of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and his mind is always engaged at the Lord's lotus feet, he is no longer interested in subjects that do not help him in self-realization. In other words, he loses all attraction for material activities. In the Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.7) it is said: eña hy evänandayati. yadä hy evaiña etasmin na dåçye 'nätmye anirukte 'nilayane 'bhayaà pratiñöhäà vindate 'tha so 'bhayaà gato bhavati. A living entity becomes established in spiritual, blissful life when he fully understands that his happiness depends on spiritual self-realization, which is the basic principle of änanda (bliss), and when he is eternally situated in the service of the Lord, who has no other lord above Him."
