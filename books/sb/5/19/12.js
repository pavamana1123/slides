    "translation": "Närada, the most powerful saintly sage, also worships Nara-Näräyaëa by chanting the following mantra: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this visible cosmic manifestation, yet He is completely free from false prestige. Although to the foolish He appears to have accepted a material body like us, He is unaffected by bodily tribulations like hunger, thirst and fatigue. Although He is the witness who sees everything, His senses are unpolluted by the objects He sees. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto that unattached, pure witness of the world, the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead.",

            "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is described as sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1), the body of eternity, transcendental bliss and full knowledge. Now in this verse He is more fully described. Kåñëa is the creator of the entire cosmic manifestation, yet He is unattached to it. If we were to construct a very tall skyscraper, we would be very attached to it, but Kåñëa is so renounced that although He has created everything, He is not attached to anything (na badhyate). Furthermore, although Kåñëa has His transcendental form, sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1), He is not disturbed by the bodily necessities of life, which are called daihika; for example, He is never hungry, thirsty or fatigued (na hanyate deha-gato 'pi daihikaiù). Then again, since everything is Kåñëa's property, He sees everything and is present everywhere, but because His body is transcendental, He is above vision, the objects of vision and the process of vision. When we see someone beautiful, we are attracted. The sight of a beautiful woman immediately attracts a man, and the sight of a man naturally attracts a woman. Kåñëa, however, is transcendental to all these faults. Although He is the seer of everything, He is not afflicted with faulty vision (na dåg yasya guëair vidüñyate). Therefore, although He is the witness and seer, He is aloof from all affection for the activities He sees. He is always unattached and separate; He is only a witness."
