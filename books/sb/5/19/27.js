    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead fulfills the material desires of a devotee who approaches Him with such motives, but He does not bestow benedictions upon the devotee that will cause him to demand more benedictions again. However, the Lord willingly gives the devotee shelter at His own lotus feet, even though such a person does not aspire for it, and that shelter satisfies all his desires. That is the Supreme Personality's special mercy.",

One who engages in the service of the Lord with some motive is called a sakäma-bhakta, and one who serves the Lord without any motives is called an akäma-bhakta. Kåñëa is so merciful that He turns a sakäma-bhakta into an akäma-bhakta. A pure devotee, an akäma-bhakta, who has no material motives, is satisfied simply to serve the lotus feet of the Lord. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä  as follows."

Kåñëa kahe—the Lord says; ämä bhaje—\"He is engaged in My service\"; mäge viñaya-sukha—\"but he wants the benefits of material sense gratification.\" Amåta chäòi' viña mäge:—\"such a devotee is like a person who asks for poison instead of nectar.\" Ei baòa mürkha: \"That is his foolishness.\" Ami-vijïa: \"But I am experienced.\" Ei mürkhe 'viñaya' kene diba: \"Why should I give such a foolish person the dirty things of material enjoyment?\" Sva-caraëa-måta: \"It would be better for Me to give him shelter at My lotus feet.\" 'Viñaya' bhuläiba: \"I shall cause him to forget all material desires.\" Käma lägi' kåñëa bhaje—if one engages in the service of the Lord for sense gratification; paya kåñëa-rase—the result is that he ultimately gets a taste for serving the lotus feet of the Lord.
