    "translation": "Bhärata-varña offers the proper land and circumstances in which to execute devotional service, which can free one from the results of jïäna and karma. If one obtains a human body in the land of Bhärata-varña, with clear sensory organs with which to execute the saìkértana-yajïa, but in spite of this opportunity he does not take to devotional service, he is certainly like liberated forest animals and birds that are careless and are therefore again bound by a hunter.",

Otherwise there is no difference between human life and the lives of jungle animals and birds. Animals and birds also have freedom, but because of their lower birth, they cannot use it. Taking advantage of all the facilities offered him, a human being who has taken birth in the land of Bhärata-varña should become a fully enlightened devotee and go back home, back to Godhead. This is the subject matter of the Kåñëa consciousness movement. The inhabitants of places other than Bhärata-varña have facilities for material enjoyment, but they do not have the same facility to take to Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has advised that one who has taken birth as a human being in Bhärata-varña must first realize himself as a part and parcel of Kåñëa, and after taking to Kåñëa consciousness, he must distribute this knowledge all over the world."
