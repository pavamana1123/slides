    "translation": "The Lord, whose pure form [sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1)] is uncontaminated by the modes of material nature, can be perceived by pure consciousness. In the Vedänta He is described as being one without a second. Because of His spiritual potency, He is untouched by the contamination of material nature, and because He is not subjected to material vision, He is known as transcendental. He has no material activities, nor has He a material form or name. Only in pure consciousness, Kåñëa consciousness, can one perceive the transcendental form of the Lord. Let us be firmly fixed at the lotus feet of Lord Rämacandra, and let us offer our respectful obeisances unto those transcendental lotus feet.",

We know that the viñëu-tattva is carried by the transcendental bird Garuòa and is equipped with different types of weapons in four hands. Therefore we may doubt whether Lord Rämacandra could be in the same category, since He was carried by Hanumän, not by Garuòa, and had neither four hands nor the çaìkha, cakra, gadä and padma. Consequently this verse clarifies that Rämacandra is as good as Kåñëa (rämädi-mürtiñu kalä). Although Kåñëa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, Rämacandra is not different from Him. Rämacandra is unaffected by the modes of material nature, and therefore He is praçänta, never disturbed by those modes."

            "content": "Unless one is saturated with love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one cannot appreciate the transcendental value of Lord Rämacandra; one cannot see Him with material eyes. Because demons like Rävaëa have no spiritual vision, they consider Lord Rämacandra an ordinary kñatriya king. Rävaëa therefore attempted to kidnap Lord Rämacandra's eternal consort, Sétädevé. Actually, however, Rävaëa could not carry off Sétädevé in her original form. As soon as she was touched by Rävaëa's hands, she gave him a material form, but she maintained her original form beyond his vision. Therefore in this verse the words pratyak praçäntam indicate that Lord Rämacandra and His potency, the goddess Sétä, keep themselves aloof from the influence of the material energy."

He is seen in His eternal form of Çyämasundara, situated within the heart of the devotee.\" Similarly, in the Chändogya Upaniñad it is stated, etäs tisro devatä anena jévena. In this verse of the Chändogya Upaniñad the word anena is used to distinguish the ätmä and Paramätmä as two separate identities. The words tisro devatä indicate that the body of the living entity is made of three material elements—fire, earth and water. Although the Paramätmä enters the heart of the jévätmä, who is influenced and designated by a material body, the Paramätmä has nothing to do with the jévätmä's body. Because the Paramätmä has no material connections, He is described here as anäma-rüpaà niraham. The Paramätmä has no material identity, whereas the jévätmä does. The jévätmä may introduce himself as an Indian, American, German and so on, but the Paramätmä has no such material designations, and therefore He has no material name. The jévätmä is different from his name, but the Paramätmä is not; His name and He Himself are one and the same. This is the meaning of niraham, which means \"without material designations.\" This word cannot possibly be twisted to mean that the Paramätmä has no ahaìkära, no \"I-ness\" or identity. He has His transcendental identity as the Supreme. This is the explanation given by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé. According to another interpretation, given by Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, niraham means nirniçcayena aham. Niraham does not mean that the Supreme Lord has no identity. Rather, the stress given by the word aham proves strongly that He does have His personal identity because nir not only means \"negative\" but also means \"strong ascertainment.\""
