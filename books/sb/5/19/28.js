    "translation": "We are now living in the heavenly planets, undoubtedly as a result of our having performed ritualistic ceremonies, pious activities and yajïas and having studied the Vedas. However, our lives here will one day be finished. We pray that at that time, if any merit remains from our pious activities, we may again take birth in Bhärata-varña as human beings able to remember the lotus feet of the Lord. The Lord is so kind that He personally comes to the land of Bhärata-varña and expands the good fortune of its people.",

Even the demigods must return to earth to work like ordinary men when the results of their pious activities expire. Nevertheless, the demigods desire to come to the land of Bhärata-varña if even a small portion of the merits of their pious activities remains. In other words, to take birth in Bhärata-varña, one must perform more pious activities than the demigods. In Bhärata-varña one is naturally Kåñëa conscious, and if one further cultivates his Kåñëa consciousness, by the grace of Kåñëa he certainly expands his good fortune by becoming perfect in Kåñëa consciousness and very easily going back home, back to Godhead. In many other places in the Vedic literature it is found that even the demigods want to come to this land of Bhärata-varña. A foolish person may desire to be promoted to the heavenly planets as a result of his pious activities, but even the demigods from the heavenly planets want to come to Bhärata-varña and achieve bodies that may be very easily used to cultivate Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu repeatedly says:"

Therefore those already born in Bhärata-varña should take lessons from the çästras and guru and should fully take advantage of the mercy of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu in order to be fully equipped with Kåñëa consciousness. By taking full advantage of Kåñëa consciousness, one goes back home, back to Godhead (yänti mad-yäjino 'pi mäm ). The Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore spreading this facility to human society by opening many, many centers all over the world so that people may associate with the pure devotees of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, understand the science of Kåñëa consciousness and ultimately go back home, back to Godhead."
