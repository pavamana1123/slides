    "translation": "Since the human form of life is the sublime position for spiritual realization, all the demigods in heaven speak in this way: How wonderful it is for these human beings to have been born in the land of Bhärata-varña. They must have executed pious acts of austerity in the past, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself must have been pleased with them. Otherwise, how could they engage in devotional service in so many ways? We demigods can only aspire to achieve human births in Bhärata-varña to execute devotional service, but these human beings are already engaged there.",

In Bhärata-varña, all the äcäryas contributed their experience, and Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu personally appeared to teach the people of Bhärata-varña how to progress in spiritual life and be fixed in devotional service to the Lord. From all points of view, Bhärata-varña is the special land where one can very easily understand the process of devotional service and adopt it to make his life successful. If one makes his life successful in devotional service and then preaches devotional service in other parts of the world, people throughout the world will actually benefit."
