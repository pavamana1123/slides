    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of all transcendental opulences and the master of the spiritual sky. He is the Supreme Person, Bhagavän, the Supersoul of everyone. The demigods, led by Indra, the King of heaven, are entrusted with seeing to the affairs of the material world. To benefit all living beings in all the varied planets and to increase the power of those elephants and of the demigods, the Lord manifests Himself on top of that mountain in a spiritual body, uncontaminated by the modes of material nature. Surrounded by His personal expansions and assistants like Viñvaksena, He exhibits all His perfect opulences, such as religion and knowledge, and His mystic powers such as aëimä, laghimä and mahimä. He is beautifully situated, and He is decorated by the different weapons in His four hands.",
