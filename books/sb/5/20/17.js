Therefore we request you to offer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead the yajïic ingredients we are offering the demigods, for the Lord is the real enjoyer.",

            "content": "The demigods are servants who assist the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one worships the demigods, the demigods, as servants of the Supreme, carry the sacrificial offerings to the Lord, like tax collectors collecting revenue from the citizens and bringing it to the government's treasury. The demigods cannot accept the sacrificial offerings; they simply carry the offerings to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädaù: since the guru is a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he carries to the Lord whatever is offered to him. Similarly, all the demigods, as faithful servants of the Supreme Lord, hand over to the Supreme Lord whatever is offered to them in sacrificial performances. There is no fault in worshiping the demigods with this understanding, but to think that the demigods are independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and equal to Him is called håta-jïäna, a loss of intelligence (kämais tais tair håta jïänäù ). One who thinks that the demigods themselves are the actual benefactors is mistaken."
