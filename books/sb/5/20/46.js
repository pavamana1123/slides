    "translation": "All living entities, including demigods, human beings, animals, birds, insects, reptiles, creepers and trees, depend upon the heat and light given by the sun-god from the sun planet. Furthermore, it is because of the sun's presence that all living entities can see, and therefore he is called dåg-éçvara, the Personality of Godhead presiding over sight.",

He is therefore upäsya, worshipable. We worship the sun-god by chanting the Gäyatré mantra (oà bhür bhuvaù svaù tat savitur vareëyaà bhargo devasya dhémahi). Sürya is the life and soul of this universe, and there are innumerable universes for which a sun-god is the life and soul, just as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the life and soul of the entire creation. We have information that Vairäja, Hiraëyagarbha, entered the great, dull, material globe called the sun. This indicates that the theory held by so-called scientists that no one lives there is wrong. Bhagavad-gétä also says that Kåñëa first instructed Bhagavad-gétä to the sun-god (imaà vivasvate yogaà proktavän aham avyayam ). Therefore the sun is not vacant. It is inhabited by living entities, and the predominating deity is Vairäja, or Vivasvän. The difference between the sun and earth is that the sun is a fiery planet, but everyone there has a suitable body and can live there without difficulty."
