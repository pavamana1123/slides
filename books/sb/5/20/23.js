Kindly continue to purify us.",

The specific rivers mentioned in the çästras are also energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and people who regularly bathe in them are purified. It can actually be seen that many people are cured of diseases simply by bathing in the Ganges. Similarly, the inhabitants of Krauïcadvépa purify themselves by bathing in the rivers there."
