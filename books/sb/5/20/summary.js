Between them is a mountain called Lokäloka, which is situated one billion miles from the edge of the universe. Lord Näräyaëa, expanding His opulence, resides upon this mountain.

The distance between the sun and the circumference of Aëòa-golaka, the globe of the universe, is estimated to be twenty-five koöi yojanas (two billion miles). Because the sun enters the universe and divides the sky, it is known as Märtaëòa, and because it is produced from Hiraëyagarbha, the body of the mahat-tattva, it is also called Hiraëyagarbha."
