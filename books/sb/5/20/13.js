    "translation": "Outside the ocean of liquor is another island, known as Kuçadvépa, which is 800,000 yojanas [6,400,000 miles] wide, twice as wide as the ocean of liquor. As Çälmalédvépa is surrounded by a liquor ocean, Kuçadvépa is surrounded by an ocean of liquid ghee as broad as the island itself. On Kuçadvépa there are clumps of kuça grass, from which the island takes its name. This kuça grass, which was created by the demigods by the will of the Supreme Lord, appears like a second form of fire, but with very mild and pleasing flames. Its young shoots illuminate all directions.",

            "content": "From the descriptions in this verse, we can make an educated guess about the nature of the flames on the moon. Like the sun, the moon must also be full of flames because without flames there cannot be illumination. The flames on the moon, however, unlike those on the sun, must be mild and pleasing. This is our conviction. The modern theory that the moon is full of dust is not accepted in the verses of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. In regard to this verse, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says, suçañpäëi sukomala-çikhäs teñäà rociñä: the kuça grass illuminates all directions, but its flames are very mild and pleasing. This gives some idea of the flames existing on the moon."
