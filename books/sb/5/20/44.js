    "translation": "The sun-god is also known as Vairäja, the total material body for all living entities. Because he entered this dull egg of the universe at the time of creation, he is also called Märtaëòa. He is also known as Hiraëyagarbha because he received his material body from Hiraëyagarbha [Lord Brahmä].",

When such living beings are unavailable, Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, expands Himself as Lord Brahmä. This takes place very rarely. Consequently there are two kinds of Brahmäs. Sometimes Brahmä is an ordinary living entity, and at other times Brahmä is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Brahmä spoken of here is an ordinary living being. Whether Brahmä is the Supreme Personality of Godhead or an ordinary living being, he is known as Vairäja Brahmä and Hiraëyagarbha Brahmä. Therefore the sun-god is also accepted as Vairäja Brahmä."
