    "translation": "By the supreme will of Kåñëa, the mountain known as Lokäloka has been installed as the outer border of the three worlds—Bhürloka, Bhuvarloka and Svarloka—to control the rays of the sun throughout the universe. All the luminaries, from the sun up to Dhruvaloka, distribute their rays throughout the three worlds, but only within the boundary formed by this mountain. Because it is extremely high, extending even higher than Dhruvaloka, it blocks the rays of the luminaries, which therefore can never extend beyond it.",

Surrounding these planetary systems are the eight directions, namely east, west, north, south, northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest. Lokäloka Mountain has been established as the outer boundary of all the lokas to distribute the rays of the sun and other luminaries equally throughout the universe."

            "content": "This vivid description of how the rays of the sun are distributed throughout the different planetary systems of the universe is very scientific. Çukadeva Gosvämé described these universal affairs to Mahäräja Parékñit as he had heard about them from his predecessor. He explained these facts five thousand years ago, but the knowledge existed long, long before because Çukadeva Gosvämé received it through disciplic succession. Because this knowledge is accepted through the disciplic succession, it is perfect. The history of modern scientific knowledge, on the contrary, does not go back more than a few hundred years. Therefore, even if modern scientists do not accept the other factual presentations of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, how can they deny the perfect astronomical calculations that existed long before they could imagine such things? There is so much information to gather from Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Modern scientists, however, have no information of other planetary systems and, indeed, are hardly conversant with the planet on which we are now living."
