    "translation": "On Sälmalédvépa there is a çälmalé tree, from which the island takes its name. That tree is as broad and tall as the plakña tree—in other words 100 yojanas [800 miles] broad and 1,100 yojanas [8,800 miles] tall. Learned scholars say that this gigantic tree is the residence of Garuòa, the king of all birds and carrier of Lord Viñëu. In that tree, Garuòa offers Lord Viñëu his Vedic prayers.",
