    "translation": "Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé said to Mahäräja Parékñit: My dear King, approximately 240,000 miles beneath the planet Pätäla lives another incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the expansion of Lord Viñëu known as Lord Ananta or Lord Saìkarñaëa. He is always in the transcendental position, but because He is worshiped by Lord Çiva, the deity of tamo-guëa or darkness, He is sometimes called tämasé. Lord Ananta is the predominating Deity of the material mode of ignorance as well as the false ego of all conditioned souls. When a conditioned living being thinks, \"I am the enjoyer, and this world is meant to be enjoyed by me,\" this conception of life is dictated to him by Saìkarñaëa. Thus the mundane conditioned soul thinks himself the Supreme Lord.",

It is described elsewhere in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :"

Although such a demoniac living entity is only an insignificant part of the Supreme Lord, he forgets his true position and thinks he is the Supreme Lord. Because this forgetfulness is created by Saìkarñaëa, He is sometimes called tämasé. The name tämasé does not indicate that He has a material body. He is always transcendental, but because He is the Supersoul of Lord Çiva, who must perform tamasic activities, Saìkarñaëa is sometimes called tämasé."
