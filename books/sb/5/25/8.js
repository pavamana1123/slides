    "translation": "If persons who are very serious about being liberated from material life hear the glories of Anantadeva from the mouth of a spiritual master in the chain of disciplic succession, and if they always meditate upon Saìkarñaëa, the Lord enters the cores of their hearts, vanquishes all the dirty contamination of the material modes of nature, and cuts to pieces the hard knot within the heart, which has been tied tightly since time immemorial by the desire to dominate material nature through fruitive activities. Närada Muni, the son of Lord Brahmä, always glorifies Anantadeva in his father's assembly. There he sings blissful verses of his own composition, accompanied by his stringed instrument [or a celestial singer] known as Tumburu.",

            "content": "None of these descriptions of Lord Anantadeva are imaginary. They are all transcendentally blissful and full of actual knowledge. However, unless one hears them directly from a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession, one cannot understand them. This knowledge is delivered to Närada by Lord Brahmä, and the great saint Närada, along with his companion, Tumburu, distributes it all over the universe. Sometimes the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as Uttamaçloka, one who is praised by beautiful poetry. Närada composes various poems to glorify Lord Ananta, and therefore the word saàçlokayäm äsa (praised by selected poetry) is used in this verse."

            "content": "The Vaiñëavas in the Gauòéya-sampradäya belong to the disciplic succession stemming from Lord Brahmä. Lord Brahmä is the spiritual master of Närada, Närada is the spiritual master of Vyäsadeva, and Vyäsadeva wrote the Çrémad-Bhägavatam as a commentary on the Vedänta-sütra. Therefore all devotees in the Gauòéya-sampradäya accept the activities of Lord Ananta related in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam as authentic, and they are thus benefited by going back home, back to Godhead. The contamination in the heart of a conditioned soul is like a huge accumulation of garbage created by the three modes of material nature, especially the modes of rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance). This contamination becomes manifest in the form of lusty desires and greed for material possessions. As confirmed herein, unless one receives transcendental knowledge in disciplic succession, there is no question of his becoming purified of this contamination."
