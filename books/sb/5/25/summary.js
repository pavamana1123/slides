            "content": "In this chapter, Çukadeva Gosvämé describes Ananta, the source of Lord Çiva. Lord Ananta, whose body is completely spiritual, resides at the root of the planet Pätäla. He always lives in the core of Lord Çiva's heart, and He helps him destroy the universe. Ananta instructs Lord Çiva how to destroy the cosmos, and thus He is sometimes called tämasé, or \"one who is in the mode of darkness.\" He is the original Deity of material consciousness, and because He attracts all living entities, He is sometimes known as Saìkarñaëa. The entire material world is situated on the hoods of Lord Saìkarñaëa. From His forehead He transmits to Lord Çiva the power to destroy this material world. Because Lord Saìkarñaëa is an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, many devotees offer Him prayers, and in the planetary system of Pätäla, all the suras, asuras, Gandharvas, Vidyädharas and learned sages offer Him their respectful obeisances. The Lord talks with them in a sweet voice. His bodily construction is completely spiritual and very, very beautiful. Anyone who hears about Him from a proper spiritual master becomes free from all material conceptions of life. The entire material energy is working according to the plans of Anantadeva. Therefore we should regard Him as the root cause of the material creation. There is no end to His strength, and no one can fully describe Him, even with countless mouths. Therefore He is called Ananta (unlimited). Being very merciful toward all living entities, He has exhibited His spiritual body. Çukadeva Gosvämé describes the glories of Anantadeva to Mahäräja Parékñit in this way."
