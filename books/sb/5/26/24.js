    "translation": "If in this life a man of the higher classes [brähmaëa, kñatriya and vaiçya] is very fond of taking his pet dogs, mules or asses into the forest to hunt and kill animals unnecessarily, he is placed after death into the hell known as Präëarodha. There the assistants of Yamaräja make him their targets and pierce him with arrows.",

Whether in the West or the East, aristocratic men in the Kali-yuga adopt the fashion of going to the forest and unnecessarily killing animals. Men of the higher classes (the brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas) should cultivate knowledge of Brahman, and they should also give the çüdras a chance to come to that platform. If instead they indulge in hunting, they are punished as described in this verse. Not only are they pierced with arrows by the agents of Yamaräja, but they are also put into the ocean of pus, urine and stool described in the previous verse."
