    "translation": "One who in this world or this life is very proud of his wealth always thinks, \"I am so rich. Who can equal me?\" His vision is twisted, and he is always afraid that someone will take his wealth. Indeed, he even suspects his superiors. His face and heart dry up at the thought of losing his wealth, and therefore he always looks like a wretched fiend. He is not in any way able to obtain actual happiness, and he does not know what it is to be free from anxiety. Because of the sinful things he does to earn money, augment his wealth and protect it, he is put into the hell called Sücémukha, where the officials of Yamaräja punish him by stitching thread through his entire body like weavers manufacturing cloth.",

            "content": "When one possesses more wealth than necessary, he certainly becomes very proud. This is the situation of men in modern civilization. According to the Vedic culture, brähmaëas do not possess anything, whereas kñatriyas possess riches, but only for performing sacrifices and other noble activities as prescribed in the Vedic injunctions. A vaiçya also earns money honestly through agriculture, cow protection and some trade. If a çüdra gets money, however, he will spend it lavishly, without discrimination, or simply accumulate it for no purpose. Because in this age there are no qualified brähmaëas, kñatriyas or vaiçyas, almost everyone is a çüdra (kalau çüdra-sambhavaù). Therefore the çüdra mentality is causing great harm to modern civilization. A çüdra does not know how to use money to render transcendental loving service to the Lord. Money is also called lakñmé, and Lakñmé is always engaged in the service of Näräyaëa. Wherever there is money, it must be engaged in the service of Lord Näräyaëa. Everyone should use his money to spread the great transcendental movement of Kåñëa consciousness. If one does not spend money for this purpose but accumulates more than necessary, he will certainly become proud of the money he illegally possesses. The money actually belongs to Kåñëa, who says in Bhagavad-gétä , bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäà sarva-loka-maheçvaram: \"I am the true enjoyer of sacrifices and penances, and I am the owner of all the planets.\" Therefore nothing belongs to anyone but Kåñëa. One who possesses more money than he needs should spend it for Kåñëa. Unless one does so, he will become puffed up because of his false possessions, and therefore he will be punished in the next life, as described herein."
