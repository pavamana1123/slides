    "translation": "The King of the pitäs is Yamaräja, the very powerful son of the sun-god. He resides in Pitåloka with his personal assistants and, while abiding by the rules and regulations set down by the Supreme Lord, has his agents, the Yamadütas, bring all the sinful men to him immediately upon their death. After bringing them within his jurisdiction, he properly judges them according to their specific sinful activities and sends them to one of the many hellish planets for suitable punishments.",

Agnostics may not believe in hell, but Çukadeva Gosvämé affirms the existence of the Naraka planets, which lie between the Garbhodaka Ocean and Pätälaloka. Yamaräja is appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to see that the human beings do not violate His rules and regulations. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä :"

Therefore one should know properly what action is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is. \"One should understand the nature of karma, vikarma and akarma, and one must act accordingly. This is the law of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conditioned souls, who have come to this material world for sense gratification, are allowed to enjoy their senses under certain regulative principles. If they violate these regulations, they are judged and punished by Yamaräja. He brings them to the hellish planets and properly chastises them to bring them back to Kåñëa consciousness. By the influence of mäyä, however, the conditioned souls remain infatuated with the mode of ignorance. Thus in spite of repeated punishment by Yamaräja, they do not come to their senses, but continue to live within the material condition, committing sinful activities again and again."
