    "translation": "My dear King Parékñit, in the province of Yamaräja there are hundreds and thousands of hellish planets. The impious people I have mentioned—and also those I have not mentioned—must all enter these various planets according to the degree of their impiety. Those who are pious, however, enter other planetary systems, namely the planets of the demigods. Nevertheless, both the pious and impious are again brought to earth after the results of their pious or impious acts are exhausted.",

We should not be eager to go to the higher, heavenly planetary systems, nor should we act in such a way that we have to go to the hellish planets. The complete purpose of this material world will be fulfilled when we resume our spiritual identities and go back home, back to Godhead. The very simple method for doing this is prescribed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja . One must always simply think of Kåñëa by chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma. Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. One should become Kåñëa's devotee. worship Him and offer obeisances to Him. Thus one should engage all the activities of his life in the service of Lord Kåñëa."
