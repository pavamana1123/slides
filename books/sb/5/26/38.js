    "translation": "In the beginning [the Second and Third Cantos of Çrémad-Bhägavatam] I have already described how one can progress on the path of liberation. In the Puräëas the vast universal existence, which is like an egg divided into fourteen parts, is described. This vast form is considered the external body of the Lord, created by His energy and qualities. It is generally called the viräö-rüpa. If one reads the description of this external form of the Lord with great faith, or if one hears about it or explains it to others to propagate bhägavata-dharma, or Kåñëa consciousness, his faith and devotion in spiritual consciousness, Kåñëa consciousness, will gradually increase. Although developing this consciousness is very difficult, by this process one can purify himself and gradually come to an awareness of the Supreme Absolute Truth.",

            "content": "The Kåñëa consciousness movement is pushing forward the publication of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, as explained especially for the understanding of the modern civilized man, to awaken him to his original consciousness. Without this consciousness, one melts into complete darkness. Whether one goes to the upper planetary systems or the hellish planetary systems, he simply wastes his time. Therefore one should hear of the universal position of the viräö form of the Lord as described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. That will help one save himself from material conditional life and gradually elevate him to the path of liberation so that he can go back home, back to Godhead."
