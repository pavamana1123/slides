A guest who comes to one's home should be received very politely. If he is unwanted, the householder should not stare at him with blinking eyes, for one who does so will be put into the hell known as Paryävartana after death, and there many ferocious birds like vultures, crows, and coknis will suddenly come upon him and pluck out his eyes."
