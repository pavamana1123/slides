    "translation": "A person who indulges in sex indiscriminately—even with animals—is taken after death to the hell known as Vajrakaëöaka-çälmalé. In this hell there is a silk-cotton tree full of thorns as strong as thunderbolts. The agents of Yamaräja hang the sinful man on that tree and pull him down forcibly so that the thorns very severely tear his body.",

            "content": "The sexual urge is so strong that sometimes a man indulges in sexual relations with a cow, or a woman indulges in sexual relations with a dog. Such men and women are put into the hell known as Vajrakaëöaka-çälmalé. The Kåñëa consciousness movement forbids illicit sex. From the description of these verses, we can understand what an extremely sinful act illicit sex is. Sometimes people disbelieve these descriptions of hell, but whether one believes or not, everything must be carried out by the laws of nature, which no one can avoid."
