    "translation": "In this life, an envious person commits violent acts against many living entities. Therefore after his death, when he is taken to hell by Yamaräja, those living entities who were hurt by him appear as animals called rurus to inflict very severe pain upon him. Learned scholars call this hell Raurava. Not generally seen in this world, the ruru is more envious than a snake.",

Çréla Jéva Gosvämé confirms this in his Sandarbha: ruru-çabdasya svayaà muninaiva öékä-vidhänäl lokeñv aprasiddha eväyaà jantu-viçeñaù. Thus although rurus are not seen in this world, their existence is confirmed in the çästras."
