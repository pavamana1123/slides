    "translation": "The great sage Çukadeva Gosvämé answered: All the hellish planets are situated in the intermediate space between the three worlds and the Garbhodaka Ocean. They lie on the southern side of the universe, beneath Bhü-maëòala, and slightly above the water of the Garbhodaka Ocean. Pitåloka is also located in this region between the Garbhodaka Ocean and the lower planetary systems. All the residents of Pitåloka, headed by Agniñvättä, meditate in great samädhi on the Supreme Personality of Godhead and always wish their families well.",

Beneath Pätälaloka are other planets, known as Narakaloka, or the hellish planets. At the bottom of the universe lies the Garbhodaka Ocean. Therefore the hellish planets lie between Pätälaloka and the Garbhodaka Ocean."
