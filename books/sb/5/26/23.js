    "translation": "The shameless husbands of lowborn çüdra women live exactly like animals, and therefore they have no good behavior, cleanliness or regulated life. After death, such persons are thrown into the hell called Püyoda, where they are put into an ocean filled with pus, stool, urine, mucus, saliva and similar things. Çüdras who could not improve themselves fall into that ocean and are forced to eat those disgusting things.",

Thus there is always the chance that he may be put into the Püyoda Naraka, the hell named Püyoda, where one is forced to eat stool, urine, pus, mucus, saliva and other abominable things. It is significant that this verse is spoken especially about çüdras. If one is born a çüdra, he must continually return to the ocean of Püyoda to eat horrible things. Thus even a born çüdra is expected to become a brähmaëa; that is the meaning of human life. Everyone should improve himself. Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä :"

That facility should be given to everyone, whether one be a çüdra, a vaiçya, a woman or a kñatriya. This is the purpose of the Kåñëa consciousness movement. However, if one is satisfied to remain a çüdra, he must suffer as described in this verse: tad evätibébhatsitam açnanti."
