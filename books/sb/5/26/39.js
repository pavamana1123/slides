    "translation": "One who is interested in liberation, who accepts the path of liberation and is not attracted to the path of conditional life, is called yati, or a devotee. Such a person should first control his mind by thinking of the viräö-rüpa, the gigantic universal form of the Lord, and then gradually think of the spiritual form of Kåñëa [sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1)] after hearing of both forms. Thus one's mind is fixed in samädhi. By devotional service one can then realize the spiritual form of the Lord, which is the destination of devotees. Thus his life becomes successful.",

On the path of bondage, one eternally undergoes the repetition of birth and death. One who desires liberation from such bondage should join the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and thus take advantage of the opportunity to hear Çrémad-Bhägavatam from devotees and also explain it to propagate Kåñëa consciousness."
