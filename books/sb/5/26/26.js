Those who practice this very abominable activity say that if a wife is forced to drink her husband's semen, she remains very faithful to him. Generally only low-class men engage in this black art, but if a man born in a higher class does so, after death he is put into the hell known as Läläbhakña. There he is immersed in the river known as Çukra-nadé and forced to drink semen."
