    "translation": "In Ilävåta-varña, Lord Çiva is always encircled by ten billion maidservants of goddess Durgä, who minister to him. The quadruple expansion of the Supreme Lord is composed of Väsudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Saìkarñaëa. Saìkarñaëa, the fourth expansion, is certainly transcendental, but because his activities of destruction in the material world are in the mode of ignorance, He is known as tämasé, the Lord's form in the mode of ignorance. Lord Çiva knows that Saìkarñaëa is the original cause of his own existence, and thus he always meditates upon Him in trance by chanting the following mantra.",

            "content": "Sometimes we see a picture of Lord Çiva engaged in meditation. This verse explains that Lord Çiva is always meditating upon Lord Saìkarñaëa in trance. Lord Çiva is in charge of the destruction of the material world. Lord Brahmä creates the material world, Lord Viñëu maintains it, and Lord Çiva destroys it. Because destruction is in the mode of ignorance, Lord Çiva and his worshipable Deity, Saìkarñaëa, are technically called tämasé. Lord Çiva is the incarnation of tamo-guëa. Since both Lord Çiva and Saìkarñaëa are always enlightened and situated in the transcendental position, they have nothing to do with the modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance—but because their activities involve them with the mode of ignorance, they are sometimes called tämasé."
