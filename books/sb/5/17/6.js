    "translation": "The branch of the Ganges known as the Sétä flows through Brahmapuré atop Mount Meru, and from there it runs down to the nearby peaks of the Kesaräcala Mountains, which stand almost as high as Mount Meru itself. These mountains are like a bunch of filaments around Mount Meru. From the Kesaräcala Mountains, the Ganges falls to the peak of Gandhamädana Mountain and then flows into the land of Bhadräçva-varña. Finally it reaches the ocean of salt water in the west.",
