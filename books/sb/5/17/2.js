    "translation": "Dhruva Mahäräja, the famous son of Mahäräja Uttänapäda, is known as the most exalted devotee of the Supreme Lord because of his firm determination in executing devotional service. Knowing that the sacred Ganges water washes the lotus feet of Lord Viñëu, Dhruva Mahäräja, situated on his own planet, to this very day accepts that water on his head with great devotion. Because he constantly thinks of Kåñëa very devoutly within the core of his heart, he is overcome with ecstatic anxiety. Tears flow from his half-open eyes, and eruptions appear on his entire body.",

            "content": "When a person is firmly fixed in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is described as véra-vrata, fully determined. Such a devotee increases his ecstasy in devotional service more and more. Thus as soon as he remembers Lord Viñëu, his eyes fill with tears. This is a symptom of a mahä-bhägavata. Dhruva Mahäräja maintained himself in that devotional ecstasy, and Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu also gave us a practical example of transcendental ecstasy when He lived at Jagannätha Puré. His pastimes there are fully narrated in Caitanya-caritämåta."
