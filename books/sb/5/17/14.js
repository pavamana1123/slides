In the material world, the Lord is always worshiped as the arcä-vigraha, or Deity in the temple. There is no difference between the arcä-vigraha and the original person, and therefore those who are engaged in worshiping the Deity in the temple in full opulence, even on this planet, should be understood to be directly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead without a doubt. As enjoined in the çästras, arcye viñëau çilä-dhér guruñu nara-matiù: \"No one should treat the Deity in the temple as stone or metal, nor should one think that the spiritual master is an ordinary human being.\" One should strictly follow this çästric injunction and worship the Deity, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without offenses. The spiritual master is the direct representative of the Lord, and no one should consider him an ordinary human being. By avoiding offenses against the Deity and the spiritual master, one can advance in spiritual life, or Kåñëa consciousness."

The same God is represented by the Deity in this material world, which is only one quarter of His creation. Väsudeva, Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are also present in the four directions of this material world. There is a Vaikuëöhaloka covered with water in this material world, and on that planet is a place called Vedavaté, where Väsudeva is located. Another planet known as Viñëuloka is situated above Satyaloka, and there Saìkarñaëa is present. Similarly, in Dvärakä-puré, Pradyumna is the predominator. On the island known as Çvetadvépa, there is an ocean of milk, and in the midst of that ocean is a place called Airävaté-pura, where Aniruddha lies on Ananta. In some of the sätvata-tantras, there is a description of the nine varñas and the predominating Deity worshiped in each: (1) Väsudeva, (2) Saìkarñaëa, (3) Pradyumna, (4) Aniruddha, (5) Näräyaëa, (6) Nåsiàha, (7) Hayagréva, (8) Mahävaräha, and (9) Brahmä. \"The Lord Brahmä mentioned in this connection is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When there is no fit human being to empower as Lord Brahmä, the Lord Himself takes the position of Lord Brahmä. Tatra brahmä tu vijïeyaù pürvokta-vidhayä hariù. That Brahmä mentioned here is Hari Himself."
