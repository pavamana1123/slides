    "translation": "From that Supreme Personality of Godhead appears Lord Brahmä, whose body is made from the total material energy, the reservoir of intelligence predominated by the passionate mode of material nature. From Lord Brahmä, I myself am born as a representation of false ego known as Rudra. By my own power I create all the other demigods, the five elements and the senses. Therefore, I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is greater than any of us and under whose control are situated all the demigods, material elements and senses, and even Lord Brahmä and I myself, like birds bound by a rope. Only by the Lord's grace can we create, maintain and annihilate the material world. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Being.",

            "content": "A summary of creation is given in this verse. From Saìkarñaëa, Mahä-Viñëu expands, and from Mahä-Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu expands. Lord Brahmä, who was born of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, fathers Lord Çiva, from whom all the other demigods gradually evolve. Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu are incarnations of the different material qualities. Lord Viñëu is actually above all material qualities, but He accepts control of sattva-guëa (the mode of goodness) to maintain the universe. Lord Brahmä is born from the mahat-tattva. Brahmä creates the entire universe, Lord Viñëu maintains it, and Lord Çiva annihilates it. The Supreme Personality of Godhead controls all the most important demigods—especially Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva—exactly as the owner of a bird controls it by binding it with a rope. Sometimes vultures are controlled in this way."
