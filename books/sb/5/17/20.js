    "translation": "For persons with impure vision, the Supreme Lord's eyes appear like those of someone who indiscriminately drinks intoxicating beverages. Thus bewildered, such unintelligent persons become angry at the Supreme Lord, and due to their angry mood the Lord Himself appears angry and very fearful. However, this is an illusion. When the wives of the serpent demon were agitated by the touch of the Lord's lotus feet, due to shyness they could proceed no further in their worship of Him. Yet the Lord remained unagitated by their touch, for He is equipoised in all circumstances. Therefore who will not worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead ?",

            "content": "Anyone who remains unagitated, even in the presence of cause for agitation, is called dhéra, or equipoised. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being always in a transcendental position, is never agitated by anything. Therefore someone who wants to become dhéra must take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. In Bhagavad-gétä  Kåñëa says, dhéras tatra na muhyati: a person who is equipoised in all circumstances is never bewildered. Prahläda Mahäräja is a perfect example of a dhéra. When the fierce form of Nåsiàhadeva appeared in order to kill Hiraëyakaçipu, Prahläda was unagitated. He remained calm and quiet, whereas others, including even Lord Brahmä, were frightened by the features of the Lord."
