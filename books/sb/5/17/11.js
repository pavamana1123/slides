    "translation": "Among the nine varñas, the tract of land known as Bhärata-varña is understood to be the field of fruitive activities. Learned scholars and saintly persons declare the other eight varñas to be meant for very highly elevated pious persons. After returning from the heavenly planets, they enjoy the remaining results of their pious activities in these eight earthly varñas.",

            "content": "The heavenly places of enjoyment are divided into three groups: the celestial heavenly planets, the heavenly places on earth, and the bila heavenly places, which are found in the lower regions. Among these three classes of heavenly places (bhauma-svarga-pada-ni), the heavenly places on earth are the eight varñas other than Bhärata-varña. In Bhagavad-gétä  Kåñëa says, kñéëe puëye martya-lokaà viçanti: when the persons living in the heavenly planets exhaust the results of their pious activities, they return to this earth. In this way, they are elevated to the heavenly planets, and then they again fall to the earthly planets. This process is known as brahmäëòa bhramaëa, wandering up and down throughout the universes. Those who are intelligent—in other words, those who have not lost their intelligence—do not involve themselves in this process of wandering up and down. They take to the devotional service of the Lord so that they can ultimately penetrate the covering of this universe and enter the spiritual kingdom. Then they are situated on one of the planets known as Vaikuëöhaloka or, still higher. Kåñëaloka (Goloka Våndävana). A devotee is never caught in the process of being promoted to the heavenly planets and again coming down. Therefore Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu says:"

            "content": "Among all the living entities wandering throughout the universe, one who is most fortunate comes in contact with a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus gets the opportunity to execute devotional service. Those who are sincerely seeking the favor of Kåñëa come in contact with a guru, a bona fide representative of Kåñëa. The Mäyävädés indulging in mental speculation and the karmés desiring the results of their actions cannot become gurus. A guru must be a direct representative of Kåñëa who distributes the instructions of Kåñëa without any change. Thus only the most fortunate persons come in contact with the guru. As confirmed in the Vedic literatures, tad-vijïänärthaà sa gurum eväbhigacchet: [MU 1.2.12] one has to search out a guru to understand the affairs of the spiritual world. Çrémad-Bhägavatam also confirms this point. Tasmäd guruà prapadyeta jijïäsuù çreya uttamam:  one who is very interested in understanding the activities in the spiritual world must search out a guru—a bona fide representative of Kåñëa. From all angles of vision, therefore, the word guru is especially meant for the bona fide representative of Kåñëa and no one else. Padma Puräëa states, avaiñëavo gurur na syät: one who is not a Vaiñëava, or who is not a representative of Kåñëa, cannot be a guru. Even the most qualified brähmaëa cannot become a guru if he is not a representative of Kåñëa. Brähmaëas are supposed to acquire six kinds of auspicious qualifications: they become very learned scholars (paöhana) and very qualified teachers (päöhana); they become expert in worshiping the Lord or the demigods (yajana), and they teach others how to execute this worship (yäjana); they qualify themselves as bona fide persons to receive alms from others (pratigraha), and they distribute the wealth in charity (däna). Yet even a brähmaëa possessing these qualifications cannot become a guru unless he is the representative of Kåñëa (gurur na syät). Vaiñëavaù çva-paco guruù: but a Vaiñëava, a bona fide representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, can become a guru, even if he is çva-paca, a member of a family of dog-eaters. Of the three divisions of heavenly planets (svarga-loka), bhauma-svarga is sometimes accepted as the tract of land in Bhärata-varña known as Kashmir. In this region there are certainly good facilities for material sense enjoyment, but this is not the business of a pure transcendentalist. Rüpa Gosvämé describes the engagement of a pure transcendentalist as follows:"
