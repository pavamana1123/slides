There is also a description of the prayers Lord Çiva offers to Lord Saìkarñaëa, part of the quadruple expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Viñëu once approached Bali Mahäräja while the King was performing a sacrifice. The Lord appeared before him as Trivikrama, or Vämana, and begged alms from the King in the form of three steps of land. With two steps, Lord Vämana covered all three planetary systems and pierced the covering of the universe with the toes of His left foot. A few drops of water from the Causal Ocean leaked through this hole and fell on the head of Lord Çiva, where they remained for one thousand millenniums. These drops of water are the sacred Ganges River. It first flows onto the heavenly planets, which are located on the soles of Lord Viñëu's feet. The Ganges River is known by many names, such as the Bhägérathé and the Jähnavé. It purifies Dhruvaloka and the planets of the seven sages because both Dhruva and the sages have no other desire than to serve the Lord's lotus feet."

            "content": "The Ganges River, emanating from the lotus feet of the Lord, inundates the heavenly planets, especially the moon, and then flows through Brahmapuré atop Mount Meru. Here the river divides into four branches (known as Sétä, Alakanandä, Cakñu and Bhadrä), which then flow down to the ocean of salt water. The branch known as Sétä flows through Çekhara-parvata and Gandhamädana-parvata and then flows down to Bhadräçva-varña, where it mixes with the ocean of salt water in the West. The Cakñu branch flows through Mälyavän-giri and, after reaching Ketumäla-varña, mixes with the ocean of salt water in the West. The branch known as Bhadrä flows onto Mount Meru, Mount Kumuda, and the Néla, Çveta and Çåìgavän mountains before it reaches Kuru-deça, where it flows into the ocean of salt water in the north. The Alakanandä branch flows through Brahmälaya, crosses over many mountains, including Hemaküöa and Himaküöa, and then reaches Bhärata-varña, where it flows into the southern side of the ocean of salt water. Many other rivers and their branches flow through the nine varñas."

If any other male enters that province, Bhaväné curses him to become a woman. Lord Çiva worships Lord Saìkarñaëa by offering various prayers, one of which is as follows: \"My dear Lord, please liberate all Your devotees from material life and bind all the nondevotees to the material world. Without Your mercy, no one can be released from the bondage of material existence.\""
