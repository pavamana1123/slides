    "translation": "Similarly, the branch of the Ganges known as Alakanandä flows from the southern side of Brahmapuré [Brahma-sadana]. Passing over the tops of mountains in various lands, it falls down with fierce force upon the peaks of the mountains Hemaküöa and Himaküöa. After inundating the tops of those mountains, the Ganges falls down onto the tract of land known as Bhärata-varña, which she also inundates. Then the Ganges flows into the ocean of salt water in the south. Persons who come to bathe in this river are fortunate. It is not very difficult for them to achieve with every step the results of performing great sacrifices like the Räjasüya and Açvamedha yajïas.",

            "content": "The place where the Ganges flows into the salt water of the Bay of Bengal is still known as Gaìgä-sägara, or the meeting place of the Ganges and the Bay of Bengal. On Makara-saìkränti, in the month of January-February, thousands of people still go there to bathe, hoping to be liberated. That they can actually be liberated in this way is confirmed herein. For those who bathe in the Ganges at any time, the results of great sacrifices like the Açvamedha and Räjasüya yajïas are not at all difficult to achieve. Most people in India are still inclined to bathe in the Ganges, and there are many places where they can do so. At Prayäga (Allahabad), many thousands of people gather during the month of January to bathe in the confluence of the Ganges and Yamunä. Afterward, many of them go to the confluence of the Bay of Bengal and the Ganges to take bath there. Thus it is a special facility for all the people of India that they can bathe in the water of the Ganges at so many places of pilgrimage."
