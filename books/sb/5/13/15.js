    "translation": "There were and are many political and social heroes who have conquered enemies of equal power, yet due to their ignorance in believing that the land is theirs, they fight one another and lay down their lives in battle. They are not able to take up the spiritual path accepted by those in the renounced order. Although they are big heroes and political leaders, they cannot take to the path of spiritual realization.",

Not being able to conquer these nearby enemies, they simply try to conquer other enemies, and ultimately they die in the struggle for existence. They do not take to the path of spiritual realization or become sannyäsés. Sometimes these big leaders take up the guise of a sannyäsé and call themselves mahätmäs, but their only business is conquering their political enemies. Because they spoil their lives with the illusion of \"this is my land and my family,\" they cannot progress spiritually and attain liberation from the clutches of mäyä."
