    "translation": "Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: My dear King, O son of mother Uttarä, there were some waves of dissatisfaction in the mind of Jaòa Bharata due to his being insulted by King Rahügaëa, who made him carry his palanquin, but Jaòa Bharata neglected this, and his heart again became calm and quiet like an ocean. Although King Rahügaëa had insulted him, he was a great paramahaàsa. Being a Vaiñëava, he was naturally very kindhearted, and he therefore told the King about the constitutional position of the soul. He then forgot the insult because King Rahügaëa pitifully begged pardon at his lotus feet. After this, he began to wander all over the earth, just as before.",

            "content": "In Çrémad-Bhägavatam , Kapiladeva describes the symptoms of great personalities: titikñavaù käruëikäù suhådaù sarva-dehinäm. A saintly devotee is certainly very tolerant. He is the friend of all living entities, and he does not create enemies within the world. A pure devotee has all the qualities of a sädhu. Jaòa Bharata is an example of this. Due to the material body, his senses were certainly agitated when he was insulted by King Rahügaëa, but later, due to the King's humble submission, Jaòa Bharata excused him. It is the duty of everyone desiring to return to Godhead to become submissive like King Rahügaëa and beg pardon of Vaiñëavas one may have offended. Vaiñëavas are generally very kindhearted; therefore if one immediately submits himself at the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava, one is immediately cleared of offensive reactions. If one does not do so, the reactions will remain, and the results will not be very palatable."
