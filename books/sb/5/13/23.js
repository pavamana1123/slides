    "translation": "I offer my respectful obeisances unto the great personalities, whether they walk on the earth's surface as children, young boys, avadhütas or great brähmaëas. Even if they are hidden under different guises, I offer my respects to all of them. By their mercy, may there be good fortune in the royal dynasties that are always offending them.",

            "content": "King Rahügaëa was very repentant because he had forced Jaòa Bharata to carry his palanquin. He therefore began offering prayers to all kinds of brähmaëas and self-realized persons, even though they might be playing like children or hiding in some guises. The four Kumäras walked everywhere in the guise of five-year-old boys, and similarly there are many brähmaëas, knowers of Brahman, who traverse the globe either as young men, children or avadhütas. Being puffed up due to their position, the royal dynasties generally offend these great personalities. Therefore King Rahügaëa began to offer his respectful obeisances unto them so that the offensive royal dynasties might not glide down into a hellish condition. If one offends a great personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not excuse one, although the great personalities themselves might not take offense. Mahäräja Ambaréña was offended by Durväsä, who even approached Lord Viñëu for pardon. Lord Viñëu would not grant him pardon; therefore he had to fall down at the lotus feet of Mahäräja Ambaréña, even though Mahäräja Ambaréña was a kñatriya-gåhastha. One should be very careful not to offend the lotus feet of Vaiñëavas and brähmaëas."
