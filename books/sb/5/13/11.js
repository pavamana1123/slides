    "translation": "Sometimes the living entity is busy counteracting the natural disturbances of freezing cold, scorching heat, strong wind, excessive rainfall and so forth. When he is unable to do so, he becomes very unhappy. Sometimes he is cheated in business transactions one after another. In this way, by cheating, living entities create enmity among themselves.",

This creates enmity in society, and consequently society is filled with envious people. One person is envious of another, and this is the way of the material world. The Kåñëa consciousness movement aims at creating an atmosphere of non-envy. Of course it is not possible for everyone to become Kåñëa conscious, but the Kåñëa consciousness movement can create an exemplary society wherein there is no envy."
