    "translation": "O killer of enemies, Mahäräja Rahügaëa, if the conditioned soul somehow or other gets out of his dangerous position, he again returns to his home to enjoy sex life, for that is the way of attachment. Thus, under the spell of the Lord's material energy, he continues to loiter in the forest of material existence. He does not discover his real interest even at the point of death.",

Therefore Çrémad-Bhägavatam  says, na te viduù svärtha-gatià hi viñëum: generally people do not understand the ultimate goal of life. As stated in the Vedas, oà tad viñëoù paramaà padaà sadä paçyanti sürayaù: those who are spiritually advanced simply look to the lotus feet of Viñëu. The conditioned soul, however, not being interested in reviving his relationship with Viñëu, becomes captivated by material activities and remains in everlasting bondage, being misled by so-called leaders."
