    "translation": "After receiving lessons from the great devotee Jaòa Bharata, King Rahügaëa of the state of Sauvéra became completely aware of the constitutional position of the soul. He thus gave up the bodily conception completely. My dear King, whoever takes shelter of the servant of the servant of the Lord is certainly glorified because he can without difficulty give up the bodily conception (<a href=\"/wiki/CC_Madhya_13.80\" title=\"CC Madhya 13.80\">CC Madhya 13.80</a>).",

It has been our practical experience that the first instruction of our spiritual master infused us with Kåñëa consciousness so that now we are at least on the path of Kåñëa consciousness and can understand the philosophy. As a result, there are many devotees engaged in this Kåñëa consciousness movement. The whole world is revolving under the bodily conception; therefore there must be devotees all over the world to deliver people from the false bodily conception and fully engage them in Kåñëa consciousness."
