    "translation": "One may say that varieties arise from the planet earth itself. However, although the universe may temporarily appear to be the truth, it ultimately has no real existence. The earth was originally created by a combination of atomic particles, but these particles are impermanent. Actually the atom is not the cause of the universe, although some philosophers think so. It is not a fact that the varieties found in this material world simply result from atomic juxtaposition or combination.",

However, the scientists fail to discover the cause of atomic existence itself. Under these circumstances, we cannot accept that the atom is the cause of the universe. Such theories are advanced by unintelligent people. According to real intelligence, the real cause of the cosmic manifestation is the Supreme Lord. Janmädy asya yataù: : ahaà sarvasya prabhavo mattaù sarvaà pravartate. Kåñëa is the original cause. Sarva-käraëa-käraëam: (BS 5.1) He is the cause of all causes. Kåñëa is the cause of atoms, the material energy."
