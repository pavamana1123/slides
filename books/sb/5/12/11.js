    "translation": "What, then, is the ultimate truth? The answer is that nondual knowledge is the ultimate truth. It is devoid of the contamination of material qualities. It gives us liberation. It is the one without a second, all-pervading and beyond imagination. The first realization of that knowledge is Brahman. Then Paramätmä, the Supersoul, is realized by the yogés who try to see Him without grievance. This is the second stage of realization. Finally, full realization of the same supreme knowledge is realized in the Supreme Person. All learned scholars describe the Supreme Person as Väsudeva, the cause of Brahman, Paramätmä and others.",

The impersonal Brahman effulgence of the Absolute Truth consists of the bodily rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ya ätmäntaryämé puruña iti so 'syäàça-vibhavaù. What is known as ätmä and antaryämé, the Supersoul, is but an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sad-aiçvaryaiù pürëo ya iha bhagavän sa svayam ayam . The wise man can understand that ultimately Väsudeva, Kåñëa, is the cause of Brahman, and Paramätmä, the Supersoul. Thus Väsudeva is sarva-käraëa-käraëam (BS 5.1), the cause of all causes. This is confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The real tattva, Absolute Truth, is Bhagavän, but due to incomplete realization of the Absolute Truth, people sometimes describe the same Viñëu as impersonal Brahman or localized Paramätmä."

So-called scholars, Mäyävädés, cannot understand Kåñëa with their poor fund of knowledge. One should therefore approach an authorized person to understand Kåñëa. The spiritual master has actually seen Kåñëa; therefore he can explain Him properly."
