    "translation": "Simply by associating with exalted devotees, anyone can attain perfection of knowledge and with the sword of knowledge can cut to pieces the illusory associations within this material world. Through the association of devotees, one can engage in the service of the Lord by hearing and chanting [çravaëaà kértanam]. Thus one can revive his dormant Kåñëa consciousness and, sticking to the cultivation of Kåñëa consciousness, return home, back to Godhead, even in this life.",

Through the association of devotees, one develops Kåñëa consciousness, which is dormant within. This Kåñëa consciousness movement is giving this chance to everyone. We are giving shelter to everyone who is serious about progressing in Kåñëa consciousness. We arrange for their lodging and board so that they can peacefully cultivate Kåñëa consciousness and return home, back to Godhead, even in this life."
