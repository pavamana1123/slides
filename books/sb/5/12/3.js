The student must approach a spiritual master and surrender unto him fully (praëipätena). He must also question him in order to understand his instructions (paripraçnena). One should not only surrender to the spiritual master but also render loving service unto him (sevayä) so that the spiritual master will be pleased with the student and explain the transcendental subject matter more clearly. A challenging spirit before the spiritual master should be avoided if one is at all interested in learning the Vedic instructions in depth."
