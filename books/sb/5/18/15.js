    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: In the tract of land called Ketumäla-varña, Lord Viñëu lives in the form of Kämadeva, only for the satisfaction of His devotees. These include Lakñméjé [the goddess of fortune], the Prajäpati Saàvatsara and all of Saàvatsara's sons and daughters. The daughters of Prajäpati are considered the controlling deities of the nights, and his sons are considered the controllers of the days. The Prajäpati's offspring number 36,000, one for each day and each night in the lifetime of a human being. At the end of each year, the Prajäpati's daughters become very agitated upon seeing the extremely effulgent disc of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus they all suffer miscarriages.",

            "content": "This Kämadeva, who appears as Kåñëa's son named Pradyumna, is viñëu-tattva. How this is so is explained by Madhväcärya, who quotes from the Brahmäëòa Puräëa: kämadeva-sthitaà viñëum upäste. Although this Kämadeva is viñëu-tattva, His body is not spiritual but material. Lord Viñëu as Pradyumna or Kämadeva accepts a material body, but He still acts spiritually. It does not make any difference whether He accepts a spiritual or a material body; He can act spiritually in any condition of existence. Mäyävädé philosophers regard even Lord Kåñëa's body as material, but their opinions cannot impede the spiritual activity of the Lord."
