For this purpose, the conditioned soul must accept one body after another, and thus his strongly fixed fruitive desires continue. One cannot stop the repetition of birth and death without being completely desireless. Therefore Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé describes pure bhakti (devotional service) as follows:"

That is called pure devotional service.\" Unless one is completely freed of all material desires, which are caused by the dense darkness of ignorance, one cannot fully engage in the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore we should always offer our prayers to Lord Nåsiàhadeva, who killed Hiraëyakaçipu, the personification of material desire. Hiraëya means \"gold,\" and kaçipu means \"a soft cushion or bed.\" Materialistic persons always desire to make the body comfortable, and for this they require huge amounts of gold. Thus Hiraëyakaçipu was the perfect representative of materialistic life. He was therefore the cause of great disturbance to the topmost devotee, Prahläda Mahäräja, until Lord Nåsiàhadeva killed him. Any devotee aspiring to be free of material desires should offer his respectful prayers to Nåsiàhadeva as Prahläda Mahäräja did in this verse."
