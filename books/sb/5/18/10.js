    "translation": "My dear Lord, we pray that we may never feel attraction for the prison of family life, consisting of home, wife, children, friends, bank balance, relatives and so on. If we do have some attachment, let it be for devotees, whose only dear friend is Kåñëa. A person who is actually self-realized and who has controlled his mind is perfectly satisfied with the bare necessities of life. He does not try to gratify his senses. Such a person quickly advances in Kåñëa consciousness, whereas others, who are too attached to material things, find advancement very difficult.",

The first business of a Vaiñëava is to give up the association of persons who are not devotees of Kåñëa and who are too attached to material things—wife, children, bank balance and so on. Prahläda Mahäräja also prays to the Personality of Godhead that he may avoid the association of nondevotees attached to the materialistic way of life. If he must be attached to someone, he prays to be attached only to a devotee."

Of course, as long as one is in this material world, one must have a material body, and it must be maintained for executing devotional service. The body can be maintained very easily by eating kåñëa-prasäda. As Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä :"

Then the real business of life—to advance in Kåñëa consciousness—will stop."
