    "translation": "By manipulating a fire-generating stick, great saints and sages can bring forth the fire lying dormant within wood. In the same way, O Lord, those expert in understanding the Absolute Truth try to see You in everything—even in their own bodies. Yet you remain concealed. You are not to be understood by indirect processes involving mental or physical activities. Because You are self-manifested, only when You see that a person is wholeheartedly engaged in searching for You do You reveal Yourself. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",

            "content": "The word kriyärthaiù means \"by performing ritualistic ceremonies to satisfy the demigods.\" The word vipaçcitaù is explained in the Taittiréya Upaniñad as follows: satyaà jïänam anantaà brahma. yo veda nihitaà guhäyäà parame vyoman. so 'çnute sarvän kämän saha brahmaëä vipaçciteti. As Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä , bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän mäà prapadyate: \"After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me.\" When one understands that the Lord is situated in everyone's heart and actually sees the Lord present everywhere, he has perfect knowledge. The word jäta-vedaù means \"fire which is produced by rubbing wood.\" In Vedic times, learned sages could bring forth fire from wood. Jäta-vedaù also indicates the fire in the stomach, which digests everything we eat and which produces an appetite. The word güòha is explained in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad. Eko devaù sarva-bhüteñu güòhaù: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is understood by chanting the Vedic mantras. Sarva-vyäpé sarva-bhütäntar-ätmä: He is all-pervading, and He is within the heart of living entities. Karmädhyakñaù sarva-bhütädhiväsaù: He witnesses all activities of the living entity. Säkñé cetä kevalo nirguëaç ca: The Supreme Lord is the witness as well as the living force, yet He is transcendental to all material qualities."
