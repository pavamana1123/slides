    "translation": "O unborn one, learned Vedic scholars who are advanced in spiritual knowledge certainly know that this material world is perishable, as do other logicians and philosophers. In trance they realize the factual position of this world, and they preach the truth as well. Yet even they are sometimes bewildered by Your illusory energy. This is Your own wonderful pastime. Therefore, I can understand that Your illusory energy is very wonderful, and I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",

As soon as someone thinks, \"I am this material body (ahaà mameti , mäm eva ye prapadyante mäyäm etäà taranti te: \"Only those who surrender unto Me can overcome the influence of the material energy.\" Therefore no one should think of himself as a liberated person immune to the influence of mäyä. Everyone should very cautiously execute devotional service by rigidly following regulative principles. Thus he will remain fixed at the lotus feet of the Lord. Otherwise, a little inattention will create havoc. We have already seen an example of this in the case of Mahäräja Bharata. Mahäräja Bharata was undoubtedly a great devotee, but because he turned his attention slightly toward a small deer, he had to suffer two more births, one as a deer and another as the brähmaëa Jaòa Bharata. Afterward he was liberated and went back home, back to Godhead."

In other words, theoretical knowledge acquired by studying the Vedas is insufficient to protect one from the clutches of mäyä. One must strongly adhere to the lotus feet of the Lord in devotional service. Then one's position is secure."
