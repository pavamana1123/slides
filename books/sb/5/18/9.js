He prays not for himself, but for all living entities—the gentle, the envious and the mischievous. He always thought of the welfare of mischievous persons like his father, Hiraëyakaçipu. Prahläda Mahäräja did not ask for anything for himself; rather, he prayed for the Lord to excuse his demoniac father. This is the attitude of a Vaiñëava, who always thinks of the welfare of the entire universe."

Therefore Prahläda Mahäräja prays in this verse, khalaù prasédatäm: \"May all the envious persons be pacified.\" The material world is full of envious persons, but if one frees himself of envy, he becomes liberal in his social dealings and can think of others' welfare. Anyone who takes up Kåñëa consciousness and engages himself completely in the service of the Lord cleanses his mind of all envy (manaç ca bhadraà bhajatäd adhokñaje). Therefore we should pray to Lord Nåsiàhadeva to sit in our hearts. We should pray, bahir nåsiàho hådaye nåsiàhaù: \"Let Lord Nåsiàhadeva sit in the core of my heart, killing all my bad propensities. Let my mind become clean so that I may peacefully worship the Lord and bring peace to the entire world.\""

            "content": "\"O son of Mahäräja Nanda [Kåñëa], I am Your eternal servitor, yet somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean of birth and death. Please pick Me up from the ocean of death and place Me as one of the atoms at Your lotus feet.\" In another prayer Lord Caitanya says, mama janmani janmanéçvare bhavatäd bhaktir ahaituké tvayi:  \"Life after life, kindly let Me have unalloyed love and devotion at Your Lordship's lotus feet.\" When Prahläda Mahäräja chants oà namo bhagavate narasiàhäya, he prays for a benediction from the Lord, but because he is also an exalted Vaiñëava, he wants nothing for his personal sense gratification. The first desire expressed in his prayer is svasty astu viçvasya: \"Let there be good fortune throughout the entire universe.\" Prahläda Mahäräja thus requested the Lord to be merciful to everyone, including his father, a most envious person. According to Cäëakya Paëòita, there are two kinds of envious living entities: one is a snake, and the other is the man like Hiraëyakaçipu, who is by nature envious of everyone, even of his father or son. Hiraëyakaçipu was envious of his little son Prahläda, but Prahläda Mahäräja asked a benediction for the benefit of his father. Hiraëyakaçipu was very envious of devotees, but Prahläda wished that his father and other demons like him would give up their envious nature by the grace of the Lord and stop harassing the devotees (khalaù prasédatäm). The difficulty is that the khala (envious living entity) is rarely pacified. One kind of khala, the snake, can be pacified simply by mantras or by the action of a particular herb (mantrauñadhi-vaçaù sarpaù khalakena niväryate). An envious person, however, cannot be pacified by any means. Therefore Prahläda Mahäräja prays that all envious persons may undergo a change of heart and think of the welfare of others."

            "content": "If the Kåñëa consciousness movement spreads all over the world, and if by the grace of Kåñëa everyone accepts it, the thinking of envious people will change. Everyone will think of the welfare of others. Therefore Prahläda Mahäräja prays, çivaà mitho dhiyä. In material activities, everyone is envious of others, but in Kåñëa consciousness, no one is envious of anyone else; everyone thinks of the welfare of others. Therefore Prahläda Mahäräja prays that everyone's mind may become gentle by being fixed at the lotus feet of Kåñëa (bhajatäd adhokñaje). As indicated elsewhere in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (sa vai manaù kåñëa-padäravindayoù ). Materialists always think of sense gratification, but Prahläda Mahäräja prays that the Lord's mercy will change their minds and they will stop thinking of sense gratification. If they think of Kåñëa always, everything will be all right. Some people argue that if everyone thought of Kåñëa in that way, the whole universe would be vacated because everyone would go back home, back to Godhead. However, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says that this is impossible because the living entities are innumerable. If one set of living entities is actually delivered by the Kåñëa consciousness movement, another set will fill the entire universe."
