    "translation": "The objects of material enjoyment [sound, form, taste, touch and smell], the activities of the senses, the controllers of sensory activities [the demigods], the body, eternal time and egotism are all creations of Your material energy. Those whose intelligence has become fixed by perfect execution of mystic yoga can see that all these elements result from the actions of Your external energy. They can also see Your transcendental form as Supersoul in the background of everything. Therefore I repeatedly offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",

A person advanced in spiritual knowledge, or a person expert in the practice of mystic yoga (yama, niyama, äsana and so on) can understand transcendence either as Paramätmä or as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord is the original cause of all natural events. Therefore He is described as sarva-käraëa-käraëam (BS 5.1), the cause of all causes. Behind everything visible to our material eyes is some cause, and one who can see the original cause of all causes, Lord Kåñëa, can actually see. Kåñëa, the sac-cid-änanda-vigraha (BS 5.1), is the background of everything, as He Himself confirms in Bhagavad-gétä :"
