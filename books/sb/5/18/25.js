            "content": "Soon after the cosmic creation, the entire universe was inundated with water. At that time Lord Kåñëa (Keçava) incarnated as a gigantic fish to protect the Vedas. Therefore Manu addresses Lord Matsya as mukhyatama, the first incarnation to appear. Fish are generally considered a mixture of the modes of ignorance and passion, but we must understand that every incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely transcendental. There is never any deterioration of the Supreme Lord's original transcendental quality. Therefore the word sattväya is used here, meaning pure goodness on the transcendental platform. There are many incarnations of the Supreme Lord: Varäha mürti (the boar form), Kürma mürti (the tortoise form), Hayagréva mürti (the form of a horse) and so on. Yet we should never think any of Them material. They are always situated on the platform of çuddha-sattva, pure transcendence."
