    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: My dear King, Lord Nåsiàhadeva resides in the tract of land known as Hari-varña. In the Seventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, I shall describe to you how Prahläda Mahäräja caused the Lord to assume the form of Nåsiàhadeva. Prahläda Mahäräja, the topmost devotee of the Lord, is a reservoir of all the good qualities of great personalities. His character and activities have delivered all the fallen members of his demoniac family. Lord Nåsiàhadeva is very dear to this exalted personality. Thus Prahläda Mahäräja, along with his servants and all the denizens of Hari-varña, worships Lord Nåsiàhadeva by chanting the following mantra.",

Apparently helpless before him, Prahläda Mahäräja called on the Lord, who immediately assumed the gigantic form of Nåsiàhadeva, half-lion and half-man, to kill the gigantic demon. Although Kåñëa is the original person, one without a second, He assumes different forms just to satisfy His devotees or to execute a specific purpose. Therefore Jayadeva Gosvämé always repeats the name of Keçava, the original Personality of Godhead, in his prayers describing the Lord's different incarnations for different purposes."
