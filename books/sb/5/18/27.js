    "translation": "My Lord, from the great leaders of the universe, such as Lord Brahmä and other demigods, down to the political leaders of this world, all are envious of Your authority. Without Your help, however, they could neither separately nor concertedly maintain the innumerable living entities within the universe. You are actually the only maintainer of all human beings, of animals like cows and asses, and of plants, reptiles, birds, mountains and whatever else is visible within this material world.",

When so-called scientists try to manufacture living entities in their laboratories, their only purpose is to defy the talent and ability of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called illusion. It exists even in the higher planetary systems, where great demigods like Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and others reside. In this world everyone is puffed up with false prestige despite the failure of all his endeavors. When so-called philanthropists, who supposedly want to help the poor, are approached by members of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, they say, \"You are simply wasting your time, while I am feeding vast masses of starving people.\" Unfortunately, their meager efforts, either singly or together, do not solve anyone's problems."

            "content": "Sometimes so-called svämés are very eager to feed poor people, thinking them to be daridra-näräyaëa, the Lord's incarnations as beggars. They prefer to serve the manufactured daridra-näräyaëa than the original, supreme Näräyaëa. They say, \"Don't encourage service to Lord Näräyaëa. It is better to serve the starving people of the world.\" Unfortunately such materialists, either singly or combined in the form of the United Nations, cannot fulfill their plans. The truth is that the many millions of human beings, animals, birds and trees—indeed, all living entities—are maintained solely by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän: one person, the Supreme Lord, is supplying the necessities of life for all other living entities. To challenge the authority of Näräyaëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the business of asuras (demons). Yet sometimes suras, or devotees, are also bewildered by the illusory energy and falsely claim to be the maintainer of the entire universe. Such incidents are described in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, where Çukadeva Gosvämé tells how Lord Brahmä and King Indra became puffed up and were eventually chastised by Kåñëa."
