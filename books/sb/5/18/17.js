            "content": "The word mäyämayam used in this verse should not be understood according to the interpretations of the Mäyävädés. Mäyä means affection as well as illusion. When a mother deals with her child affectionately, she is called mäyämaya. In whatever form the Supreme Lord Viñëu appears, He is always affectionate toward His devotees. Thus the word mäyämayam is used here to mean \"very affectionate toward the devotees.\" Çréla Jéva Gosvämé writes in this regard that mäyämayam can also mean kåpä-pracuram, deeply merciful. Similarly, Çréla Véraräghava says, mäyä-pracuranätméya-saìkalpena parigåhétam ity arthaù jïäna-paryäyo'tra mäyä-çabdaù: when one is very affectionate due to an intimate relationship, one is described as mäyämaya. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains mäyämayam by dividing it into the words mäyä and ämayam. He explains these words to indicate that because the living entity is covered by the disease of illusion, the Lord is always eager to deliver His devotee from the clutches of mäyä and cure him of the disease caused by the illusory energy."
