    "translation": "O my Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who have assumed the form of a tortoise. You are the reservoir of all transcendental qualities, and being entirely untinged by matter, You are perfectly situated in pure goodness. You move here and there in the water, but no one can discern Your position. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. Because of Your transcendental position, You are not limited by past, present and future. You are present everywhere as the shelter of all things, and therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You again and again.",

            "content": "In the Brahma-saàhitä it is said, goloka eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù: (BS 5.37) the Lord always remains in Goloka, the topmost planet in the spiritual world. At the same time, He is all-pervading. This paradox is only possible for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is full of all opulences. The Lord's all-pervasiveness is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä  the Lord says, sarvasya cähaà hådi sanniviñöo mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca: \"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.\" Therefore, although the Lord is present everywhere, He cannot be seen with ordinary eyes. As Aryamä says, the Lord is anupalakñita-sthäna: no one can locate Him. This is the greatness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
