    "translation": "At the end of the millennium, ignorance personified assumed the form of a demon, stole all the Vedas and took them down to the planet of Rasätala. The Supreme Lord, however, in His form of Hayagréva retrieved the Vedas and returned them to Lord Brahmä when he begged for them. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, whose determination never fails.",

When the people of this material world become too absorbed in ignorance, the Vedic knowledge disappears. Lord Hayagréva or Lord Matsya, however, always protects the Vedic knowledge, and in due course of time it is again distributed through the medium of Lord Brahmä. Brahmä is the trustworthy representative of the Supreme Lord. Therefore when he again asked for the treasure of Vedic knowledge, the Lord fulfilled his desire."
