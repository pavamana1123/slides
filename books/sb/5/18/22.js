But I do not favor anyone, however great he may be; unless he is always engaged in the service of Your lotus feet. Because I always keep You within my heart, I cannot favor anyone but a devotee.",

Although sometimes a materialist becomes very opulent in the eyes of another materialist, such opulence is bestowed upon him by the goddess Durgädevé, a material expansion of the goddess of fortune, not by Lakñmédevé herself. Those who desire material wealth worship Durgädevé with the following mantra: dhanaà dehi rüpaà dehi rupavati bharyam dehi. \"O worshipable mother Durgädevé, please give me wealth, strength, fame, a good wife and so on.\" By pleasing goddess Durgä one can obtain such benefits, but since they are temporary, they result only in mäyä-sukha (illusory happiness). As stated by Prahläda Mahäräja, mäyä-sukhäya bharam udvahato vimüòhän:  those who work very hard for material benefits are vimüòhas, foolish rascals, because such happiness will not endure. On the other hand, devotees like Prahläda and Dhruva Mahäräja achieved extraordinary material opulences, but such opulences were not mäyä-sukha. When a devotee acquires unparalleled opulences, they are the direct gifts of the goddess of fortune, who resides in the heart of Näräyaëa."

            "content": "The material opulences a person obtains by offering prayers to the goddess Durgä are temporary. As described in Bhagavad-gétä , antavat tu phalaà teñäà tad bhavaty alpa-medhasäm: men of meager intelligence desire temporary happiness. We have actually seen that one of the disciples of Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura wanted to enjoy the property of his spiritual master, and the spiritual master, being merciful toward him, gave him the temporary property, but not the power to preach the cult of Caitanya Mahäprabhu all over the world. That special mercy of the power to preach is given to a devotee who does not want anything material from his spiritual master but wants only to serve him. The story of the demon Rävaëa illustrates this point. Although Rävaëa tried to abduct the goddess of fortune Sétädevé from the custody of Lord Rämacandra, he could not possibly do so. The Sétädevé he forcibly took with him was not the original Sétädevé, but an expansion of mäyä, or Durgädevé. As a result, instead of winning the favor of the real goddess of fortune, Rävaëa and his whole family were vanquished by the power of Durgädevé (såñöi-sthiti-pralaya-sädhana-çaktir ekä (BS 5.44))."
