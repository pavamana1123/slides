            "content": "In this chapter Çukadeva Gosvämé describes the different varñas of Jambüdvépa and the incarnation of the Supreme Lord worshiped in each. The predominating ruler of Bhadräçva-varña is Bhadraçravä. He and his many servants always worship the incarnation known as Lord Hayagréva. At the end of each kalpa, when the demon Ajïäna steals the Vedic knowledge, Lord Hayagréva appears and preserves it. Then He delivers it to Lord Brahmä. In the land known as Hari-varña, the exalted devotee Prahläda Mahäräja worships Lord Nåsiàhadeva. (The appearance of Lord Nåsiàhadeva is described in the  of Çrémad-Bhägavatam.) Following in the footsteps of Prahläda Mahäräja, the inhabitants of Hari-varña always worship Lord Nåsiàhadeva to receive from Him the benediction of being engaged in His loving service. In the tract of land known as Ketumäla-varña, the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Lord Håñékeça) appears in the form of Cupid. The goddess of fortune and the demigods living there engage in His service day and night. Manifesting Himself in sixteen parts, Lord Håñékeça is the source of all encouragement, strength and influence. The conditioned living entity has the defect of being always fearful, but simply by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can rid himself of this defect of material life. Therefore the Lord alone can be addressed as master. In the tract of land known as Ramyaka-varña, Manu and all the inhabitants worship Matsyadeva to this very day. Matsyadeva, whose form is pure goodness, is the ruler and maintainer of the whole universe, and as such He is the director of all the demigods, headed by King Indra. In Hiraëmaya-varña Lord Viñëu has assumed the form of a tortoise (Kürma mürti) and is worshiped there by Aryamä, along with all the other residents. Similarly, in the tract of land known as Uttarakuru-varña, Lord Çré Hari has assumed the form of a boar, and in that form He accepts service from all the inhabitants living there."

            "content": "All the information in this chapter can be fully realized by one who associates with devotees of the Lord. Therefore in the çästras it is recommended that one associate with devotees. This is better than residing on the banks of the Ganges. In the hearts of pure devotees reside all good sentiments as well as all the superior qualities of the demigods. In the hearts of nondevotees, however, there cannot be any good qualities, for such people are simply enchanted by the external, illusory energy of the Lord. Following in the footsteps of devotees, one should know that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only worshipable Deity. Everyone should accept this proposal and worship the Lord. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: the purpose of studying all Vedic literature is to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. If after studying all the Vedic literature, one does not awaken his dormant love for the Supreme Lord, it is to be understood that he has labored for nothing. He has simply wasted his time. Lacking attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he remains attached to family life in this material world. Thus the lesson of this chapter is that one should get out of family life and completely take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord."
