    "translation": "My dear Lord, You are certainly the fully independent master of all the senses. Therefore all women who worship You by strictly observing vows because they wish to acquire a husband to satisfy their senses are surely under illusion. They do not know that such a husband cannot actually give protection to them or their children. Nor can he protect their wealth or duration of life, for he himself is dependent on time, fruitive results and the modes of nature, which are all subordinate to You.",

            "content": "In this verse, Lakñmédevé (Ramä) shows compassion toward women who worship the Lord for the benediction of possessing a good husband. Although such women desire to be happy with children, wealth, a long duration of life and everything dear to them, they cannot possibly do so. In the material world, a so-called husband is dependent on the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of a woman whose husband, being dependent on the result of his own fruitive actions, cannot maintain his wife, her children, her wealth or her duration of life. Therefore, factually the only real husband of all women is Kåñëa, the supreme husband. Because the gopés were liberated souls, they understood this fact. Therefore they rejected their material husbands and accepted Kåñëa as their real husband. Kåñëa is the real husband not only of the gopés, but of every living entity. Everyone should perfectly understand that Kåñëa is the real husband of all living entities, who are described in the Bhagavad-gétä as prakåti (female), not puruña (male). In Bhagavad-gétä , only Kåñëa is addressed as puruña:"

Therefore any woman who seeks a material husband for her protection, or any man who desires to become the husband of a woman, is under illusion. To become a husband means to maintain a wife and children nicely by supplying wealth and security. However, a material husband cannot possibly do this, for he is dependent on his karma. Karmaëä-daiva-netreëa:  the Lord provides everyone with his quota. Actually, however, every living entity is prakåti, or female, and Kåñëa is the only husband."
