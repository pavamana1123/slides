Even the goddess of fortune could not receive the same favor as the gopés, although she underwent severe austerities and penances for many years. Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu discusses this point with Vyeìkaöa Bhaööa in Caitanya-caritämåta : \"The Lord inquired from Vyeìkaöa Bhaööa, 'Your worshipable goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, always remains on the chest of Näräyaëa, and she is certainly the most chaste woman in the creation. However, My Lord is Lord Çré Kåñëa, a cowherd boy engaged in tending cows. Why is it that Lakñmé, being such a chaste wife, wants to associate with My Lord? Just to associate with Kåñëa, Lakñmé abandoned all transcendental happiness in Vaikuëöha and for a long time accepted vows and regulative principles and performed unlimited austerities.'\"Vyeìkaöa Bhaööa replied, 'Lord Kåñëa and Lord Näräyaëa are one and the same, but the pastimes of Kåñëa are more relishable due to their sportive nature. They are very pleasing for Kåñëa's çaktis. Since Kåñëa and Näräyaëa are both the same personality, Lakñmé's association with Kåñëa did not break her vow of chastity. Rather, it was in great fun that the goddess of fortune wanted to associate with Lord Kåñëa. The goddess of fortune considered that her vow of chastity would not be damaged by her relationship with Kåñëa. Rather, by associating with Kåñëa she could enjoy the benefit of the räsa dance. If she wanted to enjoy herself with Kåñëa what fault is there? Why are you joking so about this?'\n\"Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu replied, 'I know that there is no fault in the goddess of fortune, but still she could not enter into the räsa dance. We hear this from revealed scriptures. The authorities of Vedic knowledge met Lord Rämacandra in Daëòakäraëya, and by their penances and austerities, they were allowed to enter into the räsa dance. But can you tell me why the goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, could not get that opportunity? '\n\"To this Vyeìkaöa Bhaööa replied, 'I cannot enter into the mystery of this incident. I am an ordinary living being. My intelligence is limited, and I am always disturbed. How can I understand the pastimes of the Supreme Lord? They are deeper than millions of oceans.'\n\"Lord Caitanya replied, 'Lord Kåñëa has a specific characteristic. He attracts everyone's heart by the mellow of His personal conjugal love. By following in the footsteps of the inhabitants of the planet known as Vrajaloka or Goloka Våndävana, one can attain the shelter of the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa. However, the inhabitants of that planet do not know that Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unaware that Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord, the residents of Våndävana like Nanda Mahäräja, Yaçodädevé and the gopés treat Kåñëa as their beloved son or lover. Mother Yaçodä accepts Him as her son and sometimes binds Him to a grinding mortar. Kåñëa's cowherd boy friends think He is an ordinary boy and get up on His shoulders. In Goloka Våndävana no one has any desire other than to love Kåñëa.' \""

Therefore if one wants to be delivered by Kåñëa directly, he must take to the service of the residents of Våndävana, who are unalloyed devotees of the Lord."
