    "translation": "This great machine, consisting of the stars and planets, resembles the form of a çiçumära [dolphin] in the water. It is sometimes considered an incarnation of Kåñëa, Väsudeva. Great yogés meditate upon Väsudeva in this form because it is actually visible.",

Therefore some yogés contemplate this imaginary çiçumära to be swimming in the sky the way a dolphin swims in water. They meditate upon it as the viräö-rüpa, the gigantic form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
