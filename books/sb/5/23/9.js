    "translation": "The body of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, which forms the Çiçumära-cakra, is the resting place of all the demigods and all the stars and planets. One who chants this mantra to worship that Supreme Person three times a day—morning, noon and evening—will surely be freed from all sinful reactions. If one simply offers his obeisances to this form or remembers this form three times a day, all his recent sinful activities will be destroyed.",

            "content": "Summarizing the entire description of the planetary systems of the universe, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says that one who is able to meditate upon this arrangement as the viräö-rüpa, or viçva-rüpa, the external body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worship Him three times a day by meditation will always be free from all sinful reactions. Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura estimates that Dhruvaloka, the polestar, is 3,800,000 yojanas above the sun. Above Dhruvaloka by 10,000,000 yojanas is Maharloka, above Maharloka by 20,000,000 yojanas is Janaloka, above Janaloka by 80,000,000 yojanas is Tapoloka, and above Tapoloka by 120,000,000 yojanas is Satyaloka. Thus the distance from the sun to Satyaloka is 233,800,000 yojanas, or 1,870,400,000 miles. The Vaikuëöha planets begin 26,200,000 yojanas (209,600,000 miles) above Satyaloka. Thus the Viñëu Puräëa describes that the covering of the universe is 260,000,000 yojanas (2,080,000,000 miles) away from the sun. The distance from the sun to the earth is 100,000 yojanas, and below the earth by 70,000 yojanas are the seven lower planetary systems called Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talätala, Mahätala, Rasätala and Pätäla. Below these lower planets by 30,000 yojanas, Çeña Näga is lying on the Garbhodaka Ocean. That ocean is 249,800,000 yojanas deep. Thus the total diameter of the universe is approximately 500,000,000 yojanas, or 4,000,000,000 miles."
