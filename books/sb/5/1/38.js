    "translation": "By the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mahäräja Priyavrata reawakened to his senses. He divided all his earthly possessions among his obedient sons. He gave up everything, including his wife, with whom he had enjoyed so much sense gratification, and his great and opulent kingdom, and he completely renounced all attachment. His heart, having been cleansed, became a place of pastimes for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus he was able to return to the path of Kåñëa consciousness, spiritual life, and resume the position he had attained by the grace of the great saint Närada.",

However beautiful one's wife and however attractive her bodily features, one is no longer interested in her when her body is dead. We praise a beautiful woman for her body, but that same body, when bereft of a spirit soul, is no longer interesting to any lusty man. Mahäräja Priyavrata was so strong, by the grace of the Lord, that even though his beautiful wife was alive, he could give up her association exactly like one who is forced to give up the association of a dead wife. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu said:"

I only want Your causeless devotional service birth after birth.\" For one who desires to advance in spiritual life, attachment to material opulence and attachment to a beautiful wile are two great impediments. Such attachments are condemned even more than suicide. Therefore anyone desiring to cross beyond material nescience must, by the grace of Kåñëa, be freed from attachment to women and money. When Mahäräja Priyavrata became completely free from these attachments, he could again peacefully follow the principles instructed by the great sage Närada."
