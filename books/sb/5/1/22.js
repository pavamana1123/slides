With the permission of the great sage Närada, he delivered to his son the governmental responsibility for maintaining and protecting all the planets of the universe. He thus achieved relief from the most dangerous, poisonous ocean of material desires.",

Now he was very pleased that Lord Brahmä had interfered by inducing his son to accept the responsibility for ruling the government of the universe. From Bhagavad-gétä we get information that Vaivasvata Manu was the son of the sun-god and that his son, Mahäräja Ikñväku, ruled this planet earth. Sväyambhuva Manu, however, appears to have been in charge of the entire universe, and he entrusted to his son, Mahäräja Priyavrata, the responsibility for maintaining and protecting all the planetary systems. Dharä-maëòala means \"planet.\" This earth, for instance, is called dharä-maëòala. Akhila, however, means \"all\" or \"universal.\" It is therefore difficult to understand where Mahäräja Priyavrata was situated, but from this literature his position certainly appears greater than that of Vaivasvata Manu, for he was entrusted with all the planetary systems of the entire universe."

            "content": "Another significant statement is that Sväyambhuva Manu took great satisfaction from abnegating the responsibility for ruling all the planetary systems of the universe. At present, politicians are very eager to take charge of the government, and they engage their men in canvassing from door to door to get votes to win the post of president or a similar exalted office. On the contrary, however, herein we find that King Priyavrata had to be persuaded by Lord Brahmä to accept the post of emperor of the entire universe. Similarly, his father, Sväyambhuva Manu, felt relieved to entrust the universal government to Priyavrata. Thus it is evident that the kings and executive heads of government in the Vedic age never accepted their positions for sense enjoyment. Such exalted kings, who were known as räjarñis, ruled only to maintain and protect the kingdom for the welfare of the citizens. The history of Priyavrata and Sväyambhuva Manu describes how exemplary, responsible monarchs performed the duties of government with disinterest, keeping themselves always aloof from the contamination of material attachment."

That is the system of Vedic civilization. At the end of life, one must free himself from worldly affairs and completely engage in the service of the Lord."
