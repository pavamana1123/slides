    "translation": "Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: The first created being and most powerful demigod in this universe is Lord Brahmä, who is always responsible for developing universal affairs. Born directly from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he dedicates his activities to the welfare of the entire universe, for he knows the purpose of the universal creation. This supremely powerful Lord Brahmä, accompanied by his associates and the personified Vedas, left his own abode in the highest planetary system and descended to the place of Prince Priyavrata's meditation.",

            "content": "Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Self (ätmä), is the source of everything, as explained in the Vedänta-sütra: janmädy asya yataù . Because Brahmä was born directly from Lord Viñëu, he is called ätma-yoni. He is also called bhagavän, although generally bhagavän refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Viñëu or Lord Kåñëa). Sometimes great personalities—such as demigods like Lord Brahmä, Närada or Lord Çiva—are also addressed as bhagavän because they carry out the purpose of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Brahmä is called bhagavän because he is the secondary creator of this universe. He is always thinking of how to improve the situation of the conditioned souls who have come to the material world to enjoy material activities. For this reason, he disseminates the Vedic knowledge throughout the universe for everyone's guidance."

            "content": "Vedic knowledge is divided into two parts: pravåtti-märga and nivåtti-märga. Nivåtti-märga is the path of negating sense enjoyment, and pravåtti-märga is the path by which the living entities are given a chance to enjoy and at the same time are directed in such a way that they can go back home, back to Godhead. Because ruling over this universe is a great responsibility, Brahmä must force many Manus in different ages to take charge of universal affairs. Under each Manu there are different kings who also execute the purpose of Lord Brahmä. It is understood from previous explanations that the father of Dhruva Mahäräja, King Uttänapäda, ruled over the universe because his elder brother, Priyavrata, practiced austerity from the very beginning of his life. Thus up to the point of the Pracetäs, the kings of the universe were all descendants of Uttänapäda Mahäräja. Since there were no suitable kings after the Pracetäs, Sväyambhuva Manu went to the Gandhamädana Hill to bring back his eldest son, Priyavrata, who was meditating there. Sväyambhuva Manu requested Priyavrata to rule over the universe. When he refused, Lord Brahmä descended from the supreme planetary system, known as Satyaloka, to request Priyavrata to accept the order. Lord Brahmä did not come alone. He came with other great sages like Maréci, Ätreya and Vasiñöha. To convince Priyavrata that it was necessary for him to follow the Vedic injunctions and accept the responsibility of ruling over the world, Lord Brahmä also brought with him the personified Vedas, his constant associates."

            "content": "A significant word in this verse is sva-bhavanät, indicating that Lord Brahmä descended from his own abode. Every demigod has his own abode. Indra, the King of the demigods, has his own abode, as do Candra, the lord of the moon planet, and Sürya, the predominating deity of the sun planet. There are many millions of demigods, and the stars and planets are their respective homes. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä. Yänti deva-vratä devän:  \"Those who worship the demigods go to their different planetary systems.\" Lord Brahmä's abode. the highest planetary system, is called Satyaloka or sometimes Brahmaloka. Brahmaloka usually refers to the spiritual world. The abode of Lord Brahmä is Satyaloka, but because Lord Brahmä resides there, it is also sometimes called Brahmaloka."
