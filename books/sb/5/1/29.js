    "translation": "After Kavi, Mahävéra and Savana were completely trained in the paramahaàsa stage of life, Mahäräja Priyavrata ruled the universe for eleven arbudas of years. Whenever he was determined to fix his arrow upon his bowstring with his two powerful arms, all opponents of the regulative principles of religious life would flee from his presence in fear of the unparalleled prowess he displayed in ruling the universe. He greatly loved his wife Barhiñmaté, and with the increase of days, their exchange of nuptial love also increased. By her feminine behavior as she dressed herself, walked, got up, smiled, laughed, and glanced about, Queen Barhiñmaté increased his energy. Thus although he was a great soul, he appeared lost in the feminine conduct of his wife. He behaved with her just like an ordinary man, but actually he was a great soul.",

            "content": "In this verse, the word dharma-pratipakñaù (\"opponents of religious principles\") refers not to a particular faith, but to varëäçrama-dharma, the division of society, socially and spiritually, into four varëas (brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra) and four äçramas (brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa). To maintain proper social order and help the citizens gradually progress toward the goal of life—namely spiritual understanding—the principles of varëäçrama-dharma must be accepted. From this verse, Mahäräja Priyavrata appears to have been so strict in maintaining this institution of varëäçrama-dharma that anyone neglecting it would immediately flee from his presence as soon as the King warned him by fighting or administering light punishment. Indeed, Mahäräja Priyavrata would not have to fight, for simply because of his strong determination, they dared not disobey the rules and regulations of varëäçrama-dharma. It is said that unless human society is regulated by varëäçrama-dharma, it is no better than a bestial society of cats and dogs. Mahäräja Priyavrata, therefore, strictly maintained varëäçrama-dharma by his extraordinary, unparalleled prowess."

            "content": "To maintain such a life of strict vigilance, one needs encouragement from his wife. In the varëäçrama-dharma system, certain classes, such as the brähmaëas and sannyäsés, do not need encouragement from the opposite sex. Kñatriyas and gåhasthas, however, actually need the encouragement of their wives in order to execute their duties. Indeed, a gåhastha or kñatriya cannot properly execute his responsibilities without the association of his wife. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu personally admitted that a gåhastha must live with a wife. Kñatriyas were even allowed to have many wives to encourage them in discharging the duties of government. The association of a good wife is necessary in a life of karma and political affairs. To execute his duties properly, therefore. Mahäräja Priyavrata took advantage of his good wife Barhiñmaté, who was always very expert in pleasing her great husband by properly dressing herself, smiling, and exhibiting her feminine bodily features. Queen Barhiñmaté always kept Mahäräja Priyavrata very encouraged, and thus he executed his governmental duty very properly. In this verse iva has twice been used to indicate that Mahäräja Priyavrata acted exactly like a henpecked husband and thereby seemed to have lost his sense of human responsibility. Actually, however, he was fully conscious of his position as a spirit soul, although he seemingly behaved like an acquiescent karmé husband. Mahäräja Priyavrata thus ruled the universe for eleven arbudas of years. One arbuda consists of 100,000,000 years, and Mahäräja Priyavrata ruled the universe for eleven such arbudas."
