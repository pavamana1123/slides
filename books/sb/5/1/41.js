There are different types of opulences on earth, in the heavenly planets and even in the lower planetary system, known as Pätäla. A devotee, however, knows that they are all material, and consequently he is not at all interested in them. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, paraà dåñövä nivartate . Sometimes yogés and jïänés voluntarily give up all material opulences to practice their system of liberation and taste spiritual bliss. However, they frequently fall down because artificial renunciation of material opulences cannot endure. One must have a superior taste in spiritual life; then he can give up material opulence. Mahäräja Priyavrata had already tasted spiritual bliss, and therefore he had no interest in any of the material achievements available in the lower, higher or middle planetary systems."
