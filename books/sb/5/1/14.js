    "translation": "My dear boy, all of us are bound by the Vedic injunctions to the divisions of varëäçrama according to our qualities and work. These divisions are difficult to avoid because they are scientifically arranged. We must therefore carry out our duties of varëäçrama-dharma, like bulls obliged to move according to the direction of a driver pulling on ropes knotted to their noses.",

            "content": "In this verse, the words tantyäà guëa-karma-dämabhiù are very important. We each get a body according to our association with the guëas, the qualities or modes of material nature, and we act accordingly. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, the four orders of the social system—namely brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra—are arranged according to guëa and karma, their qualities and work. There is some controversy about this, however, because some say that since one receives a body according to the guëa and karma of his past life, it is one's birth that determines his social status. Others say, however, that one's birth according to the guëa and karma of his past life is not the essential consideration, since one can change his guëa and karma even in this life. Thus they say that the four divisions of the social order—brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra—should be arranged according to the guëa and karma of this life. This version is confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam by Närada Muni. While instructing Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira about the symptoms of guëa and karma, Närada Muni said that these symptoms must govern the division of society. In other words, if a person born in the family of a brähmaëa has the symptoms of a çüdra, he should be designated as a çüdra. Similarly, if a çüdra has brahminical qualities, he should be designated a brähmaëa."

There is no other way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One must be situated in the institution of the four varëas and äçramas.\" All of human society is meant to worship Lord Viñëu. At the present moment, however, human society does not know that this is the ultimate goal or perfection of life. Therefore instead of worshiping Lord Viñëu. People have been educated to worship matter. According to the direction of modern society, men think they can advance in civilization by manipulating matter to build skyscrapers, big roads, automobiles and so on. Such a civilization must certainly be called materialistic because its people do not know the goal of life. The goal of life is to reach Viñëu, but instead of reaching Viñëu, people are bewildered by the external manifestation of the material energy. Therefore progress in material advancement is blind, and the leaders of such material advancement are also blind. They are leading their followers in the wrong way."

            "content": "It is best, therefore, to accept the injunctions of the Vedas, which are mentioned in this verse as yad-väci. In accordance with those injunctions, everyone should find out whether he is a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra and should thus be educated accordingly. Then his life will be successful. Otherwise, all of human society will be confused. If human society is divided scientifically according to varëa and äçrama, and if the Vedic directions are followed, one's life, regardless of his position, will be successful. It is not that brähmaëas will be elevated to the transcendental platform but not the çüdras. If the Vedic injunctions are followed, all of them—brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras—will be elevated to the transcendental platform, and their lives will be successful. The injunctions in the Vedas are explicit directions from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example cited in this verse is that bulls tied by ropes in their nostrils move according to the direction of the driver. Similarly, if we move according to the instructions of the Vedas, the perfect paths for our lives will be set. Otherwise, if we do not move in that way but act according to our whimsical ideas, our lives will be spoiled by confusion and will end in despair. Actually, because people at the present moment are not following the instructions of the Vedas, they are all confused. We must therefore accept this instruction by Lord Brahmä to Priyavrata as the factual scientific direction leading to the success of life. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä :"
