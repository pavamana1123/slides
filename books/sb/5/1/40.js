As indicated here, different classes of men are destined to live in different areas, and therefore the boundaries of various tracts of land, which are described here as islands, should be defined by different rivers, forests and hills. This is also mentioned in relation to Mahäräja Påthu, who was born from the dead body of his father by the manipulation of great sages. Mahäräja Påthu's father was very sinful, and therefore a black man called Niñäda was first born from his dead body. The Naiñäda race was given a place in the forest because by nature they are thieves and rogues. As animals are given places in various forests and hills, men who are like animals are also destined to live there. One cannot be promoted to civilized life unless one comes to Kåñëa consciousness, for by nature one is destined to live in a particular situation according to one's karma and association with the modes of nature. If men want to live in harmony and peace, they must take to Kåñëa consciousness, for they cannot achieve the highest standard while absorbed in the bodily concept of life. Mahäräja Priyavrata divided the surface of the globe into different islands so that each class of men would live peacefully and not clash with the others. The modern idea of nationhood has gradually developed from the divisions made by Mahäräja Priyavrata."
