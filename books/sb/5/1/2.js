            "content": "In Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu it is said that by executing devotional service to the Lord, one can understand the transcendental position of the living being and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be understood by any means except bhakti. The Lord confirms this in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  Lord Kåñëa says, bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti: \"simply by discharging devotional service, one can understand Me.\" Thus for a bhakta to become attached to family affairs is impossible, since a bhakta and his associates are liberated. Everyone is searching after änanda, or bliss, but in the material world there can never be any bliss. It is only possible in devotional service. Attachment for family affairs and devotional service are incompatible. Therefore Mahäräja Parékñit was somewhat surprised to hear that Mahäräja Priyavrata was simultaneously attached to devotional service and to family life."
