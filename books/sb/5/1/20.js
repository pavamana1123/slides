It is the duty of the inferior to carry out the order of the superior with great respect. Priyavrata therefore immediately said, \"Yes, sir. I shall carry out your order.\" Priyavrata is described as a mahä-bhägavata, a great devotee. The duty of a great devotee is to carry out the order of the spiritual master, or the spiritual master of the spiritual master in the paramparä system. As described in Bhagavad-gétä ."
