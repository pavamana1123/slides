All of us, including Lord Çiva, your father and the great sage Mahärñi Närada, must carry out the order of the Supreme. We cannot deviate from His order.",

They were accompanied by many other authoritative sages. Brahmä first wanted to impress upon Priyavrata that although these great personalities are all authorities, they cannot possibly disobey the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described in this verse as deva, which means \"always glorious.\" The power, glory and potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can never be diminished. In the Éçopaniñad, the Lord is described as apäpa-viddha, which indicates that He is never affected by anything materially considered sinful. Similarly, Çrémad-Bhägavatam describes the Supreme Personality of Godhead as being so powerful that nothing we might consider abominable can affect Him. An example sometimes given to explain the position of the Supreme Lord is that of the sun, which evaporates urine from the earth but is never affected by contamination. The Supreme Lord can never be accused of doing anything wrong."

Indeed, Brahmä and other genuine authorities never do anything without His permission. The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart. In the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is said, tene brahma hådä ya ädi-kavaye:  the Lord dictated Vedic knowledge to Brahmä through his heart. The more a living entity is purified by devotional service, the more he comes in direct contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä:"

Thus Lord Brahmä first advised Priyavrata to hear his words with attention and without envy."

One cannot disobey the orders of the Supreme Lord, even if one is as powerful as Lord Çiva. Lord Brahmä. Manu or the great sage Närada. All these authorities are certainly very powerful, but they do not have the power to disobey the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since Lord Brahmä had come to Priyavrata in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Lord, he first wanted to dispel any suspicions that he might be acting as Priyavrata's enemy. Lord Brahmä was following the orders of the Supreme Lord, and therefore it would be worthwhile for Priyavrata to accept Lord Brahmä's order, as the Lord desired."
