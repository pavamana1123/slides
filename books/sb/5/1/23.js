    "translation": "Following the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mahäräja Priyavrata fully engaged in worldly affairs, yet he always thought of the lotus feet of the Lord, which are the cause of liberation from all material attachment. Although Priyavrata Mahäräja was completely freed from all material contamination, he ruled the material world just to honor the orders of his superiors.",

            "content": "The words mäna-vardhano mahatäm (\"just to show honor to superiors\") are very significant. Although Mahäräja Priyavrata was already a liberated person and had no attraction for material things, he engaged himself fully in governmental affairs just to show respect to Lord Brahmä. Arjuna had also acted in the same way. Arjuna had no desire to participate in political affairs or the fighting at Kurukñetra, but when ordered to do so by the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, he executed those duties very nicely. One who always thinks of the lotus feet of the Lord is certainly above all the contamination of the material world. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä:"

This is the proper explanation of why Priyavrata engaged in worldly affairs although he was a liberated person. Also, only because of this principle does a mahä-bhägavata, who has nothing to do with the material world, come down to the second platform of devotional service to preach the glories of the Lord all over the world."
