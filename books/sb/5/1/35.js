    "translation": "My dear King, a devotee who has taken shelter of the dust from the lotus feet of the Lord can transcend the influence of the six material whips—namely hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death—and he can conquer the mind and five senses. However, this is not very wonderful for a pure devotee of the Lord because even a person beyond the jurisdiction of the four castes—in other words, an untouchable—is immediately relieved of bondage to material existence if he utters the holy name of the Lord even once.",

For a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything is possible because the Lord is also known as Urukrama.\" Urukrama is a name for Lord Vämanadeva, who performed the wonderful act of occupying the three worlds with three footsteps. Lord Vämanadeva requested three paces of land from Mahäräja Bali, and when Mahäräja Bali agreed to grant them, the Lord immediately covered the entire world with two footsteps, and for His third step He placed His foot upon Bali Mahäräja's head.

Furthermore, another sad-guëa are the mind and five sense organs. Not to speak of a sanctified devotee, even a caëòäla, an outcaste, who is untouchable, is immediately freed from material bondage if he utters the holy name of the Lord even once. Sometimes caste brähmaëas argue that unless one changes his body he cannot be accepted as a brähmaëa, for since the present body is obtained as a result of past actions, one who has in the past acted as a brähmaëa takes birth in a brähmaëa family. Therefore, they contend, without such a brahminical body, one cannot be accepted as a brähmaëa. Herein it is said, however, that even vidüra-vigata, a caëòäla—a fifth-class untouchable—is freed if he utters the holy name even once. Being freed means that he immediately changes his body. Sanätana Gosvämé confirms this:"

            "content": "When a person, even though a caëòäla, is initiated by a pure devotee into chanting the holy name of the Lord, his body changes as he follows the instructions of the spiritual master. Although one cannot see how his body has changed, we must accept, on the grounds of the authoritative statements of the çästras, that he changes his body. This is to be understood without arguments. This verse clearly says, sa jahäti bandham: \"He gives up his material bondage.\" The body is a symbolic representation of material bondage according to one's karma. Although sometimes we cannot see the gross body changing, chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord immediately changes the subtle body, and because the subtle body changes, the living entity is immediately freed from material bondage. After all, changes of the gross body are conducted by the subtle body. After the destruction of the gross body, the subtle body takes the living entity from his present gross body to another. In the subtle body, the mind is predominant, and therefore if one's mind is always absorbed in remembering the activities or the lotus feet of the Lord, he is to be understood to have already changed his present body and become purified. Therefore it is irrefutable that a caëòäla, or any fallen or lowborn person, can become a brähmaëa simply by the method of bona fide initiation."
