The glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is praised in eloquent, transcendental verses by such exalted personalities as Brahmä, are very pleasing to great devotees and liberated persons. One who is attached to the nectarean honey of the Lord's lotus feet, and whose mind is always absorbed in His glories, may sometimes be checked by some impediment, but he still never gives up the exalted position he has acquired.",

            "content": "According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, there are two kinds of impediments to devotional service. The first is an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava. This is called vaiñëava-aparädha. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu warned His devotees not to commit vaiñëava-aparädha, which He described as the mad elephant offense. When a mad elephant enters a beautiful garden, it destroys everything, leaving a barren field. Similarly, the power of vaiñëava-aparädha is so great that even an advanced devotee becomes almost devoid of his spiritual assets if he commits it. Since Kåñëa consciousness is eternal, it cannot be destroyed altogether, but advancement may be checked for the time being. Thus vaiñëava-aparädha is one kind of impediment to devotional service. Sometimes, however, the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee desires to impede one's devotional service. For example, Hiraëyakaçipu and Hiraëyäkña were formerly Jaya and Vijaya, the gatekeepers in Vaikuëöha, but by the desire of the Lord, they became His enemies for three lives. Thus the desire of the Lord is another kind of impediment. But in both cases, the pure devotee, once advanced in Kåñëa consciousness, cannot be lost. Following the orders of his superiors (Sväyambhuva and Lord Brahmä), Priyavrata accepted family life, but this did not mean he lost his position in devotional service. Kåñëa consciousness is perfect and eternal, and therefore it cannot be lost under any circumstances. Because the material world is full of obstructions to advancement in Kåñëa consciousness, there may appear to be many impediments, yet Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, declares in Bhagavad-gétä , kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati: once one has taken shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, he cannot be lost."

Because of his previous practice, such a perfect devotee naturally becomes attached to devotional service, apparently without cause. Despite all kinds of impediments due to surrounding circumstances, he automatically perseveres in devotional service and gradually advances until he once again becomes perfect. Bilvamaìgala Öhäkura had been an advanced devotee in his previous life, but in his next life he became greatly fallen and was attached to a prostitute. Suddenly, however, his entire behavior was changed by the words of the very prostitute who had so much attracted him, and he became a great devotee. In the lives of exalted devotees, there are many such instances, proving that once one has taken to the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, he cannot be lost (kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati )."
