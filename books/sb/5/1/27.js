    "translation": "Thus situated in the renounced order from the beginning of their lives, all three of them completely controlled the activities of their senses and thus became great saints. They concentrated their minds always upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the resting place of the totality of living entities and who is therefore celebrated as Väsudeva. Lord Väsudeva is the only shelter of those who are actually afraid of material existence. By constantly thinking of His lotus feet, these three sons of Mahäräja Priyavrata became advanced in pure devotional service. By the prowess of their devotional service, they could directly perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone's heart as the Supersoul, and realize that there was qualitatively no difference between themselves and Him.",

            "content": "The paramahaàsa stage is the topmost position in renounced life. In sannyäsa, the renounced order, there are four stages—kuöécaka, bahüdaka, parivräjakäcärya and paramahaàsa. According to the Vedic system, when one accepts the renounced order, he stays outside his village in a cottage, and his necessities, especially his food, are supplied from home. This is called the kuöécaka stage. When a sannyäsé advances further, he no longer accepts anything from home: instead, he collects his necessities, especially his food, from many places. This system is called mädhukaré, which literally means \"the profession of the bumblebees.\" As bumblebees collect honey from many flowers, a little from each, so a sannyäsé should beg from door to door but not accept very much food from any particular house; he should collect a little bit from every house. This is called the bahüdaka stage. When a sannyäsé is still more experienced, he travels all over the world to preach the glories of Lord Väsudeva. He is then known as parivräjakäcärya. The sannyäsé reaches the paramahaàsa stage when he finishes his preaching work and sits down in one place, strictly for the sake of advancing in spiritual life. An actual paramahaàsa is one who completely controls his senses and engages in the unalloyed service of the Lord. Therefore all three of these sons of Priyavrata, namely Kavi, Mahävéra and Savana, were situated in the paramahaàsa stage from the very beginning. Their senses could not disturb them, for their senses were completely engaged in serving the Lord. Therefore the three brothers are described in this verse as upaçama-çéläù. Upaçama means \"completely subdued.\" Because they completely subdued their senses, they are understood to have been great sages and saints."
