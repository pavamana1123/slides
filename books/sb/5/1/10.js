    "translation": "My dear King Parékñit, because Lord Brahmä had finally descended from Satyaloka to Bhüloka, Närada Muni, Prince Priyavrata and Sväyambhuva Manu came forward to offer him objects of worship and to praise him in highly qualified language, according to Vedic etiquette. At that time, Lord Brahmä, the original person of this universe, felt compassion for Priyavrata and, looking upon him with a smiling face, spoke to him as follows.",

            "content": "That Lord Brahmä descended from Satyaloka to see Priyavrata indicates that the matter was very serious. Närada Muni had come to advise Priyavrata about the value of spiritual life, knowledge, renunciation and bhakti, and Lord Brahmä knew that Närada's instructions were very impressive. Therefore unless Lord Brahmä personally went to Gandhamädana Hill to request Priyavrata, Lord Brahmä knew that prince Priyavrata would not accept his father's order. Brahmä's purpose was to break Priyavrata's determination. Therefore Brahmä first looked upon Priyavrata with compassion. His smile and compassionate features also indicated that although Brahmä would request Priyavrata to accept household life, Priyavrata would not be out of touch with devotional service. By the blessings of a Vaiñëava, everything is possible. This is described in Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu as kåpä-siddhi, or perfection attained simply by the blessings of a superior person. One usually becomes liberated and perfect by executing the regulative principles set down in the çästras. Nonetheless, many persons have achieved perfection simply by the blessings of a spiritual master or superior."

Thus Lord Brahmä's affectionate smile and glance meant, \"My dear Priyavrata, you have decided not to accept household life, but I have decided to convince you that you must accept it.\" Actually, Brahmä had come to praise Priyavrata for his high standard of renunciation, austerity, penance and devotion so that he would not be deviated from devotional service, even though he would accept household life."

In the Vedas, there is the following prayer to Lord Brahmä: hiraëyagarbhaù samavartatägre bhütasya jätaù patir eka äsét. Brahmä was received with the appropriate Vedic hymns, and because he was welcomed according to the Vedic etiquette, he was very pleased."
