    "translation": "While enjoying his material opulences with full strength and influence, Mahäräja Priyavrata once began to consider that although he had fully surrendered to the great saint Närada and was actually on the path of Kåñëa consciousness, he had somehow become again entangled in material activities. Thus his mind now became restless, and he began to speak in a spirit of renunciation.",

On the other hand, a nondevotee, though fully engaged in occupational duties, does not gain anything.\" If one somehow or other comes to the shelter of a great Vaiñëava, takes to Kåñëa consciousness because of sentiment or realization, but in course of time falls down because of immature understanding, he is not actually fallen, for his having engaged in Kåñëa consciousness is a permanent asset. If one falls down, therefore, his progress might be checked for a certain time, but it will again become manifest at an opportune moment. Although Priyavrata Mahäräja was serving according to the instructions of Närada Muni meant for going back home, back to Godhead, he returned to material affairs at the request of his father. In due course of time, however, his consciousness for serving Kåñëa reawakened by the grace of his spiritual master, Närada."

One who falls down from the process of bhakti-yoga is again offered the opulence of the demigods, and after enjoying such material opulence, he is given a chance to take birth in a noble family of a pure brähmaëa, or in a rich family, to be given the chance to revive his Kåñëa consciousness. This actually happened in the life of Priyavrata: he is a most glorious example of this truth. In due course of time, he no longer wanted to enjoy his material opulences and his wife, kingdom and sons; instead, he wanted to renounce them all. Therefore, after having described the material opulences of Mahäräja Priyavrata, Çukadeva Gosvämé, in this verse, describes his tendency for renunciation."

In regard to strictly following the regulative principles, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says; daëòavat-praëämäs tän anupatitaù. By immediately offering obeisances (daëòavat) unto the spiritual master and by strictly following his directions, the student becomes advanced. Mahäräja Priyavrata was doing all these things regularly."

It is not that Mahäräja Priyavrata was freed from material influence because he possessed all material opulences. In this material world, both the very poor man and the very rich man are under material influences, for both wealth and poverty are creations of the modes of material nature.
