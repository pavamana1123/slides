    "translation": "Lord Brahmä was then worshiped by Manu, who respectfully satisfied him as well as he could. Priyavrata and Närada also looked upon Brahmä with no tinges of resentment. Having engaged Priyavrata in accepting his father's request, Lord Brahmä returned to his abode, Satyaloka, which is indescribable by the endeavor of mundane mind or words.",

Priyavrata and Närada were also very satisfied. Although Brahmä had forced Priyavrata to accept the management of worldly affairs, thus breaking his vow to remain brahmacäré and completely engage in devotional service, Närada and Priyavrata did not look upon Brahmä with resentment. Närada was not at all sorry that he had been frustrated in making Priyavrata a disciple. Both Priyavrata and Närada were exalted personalities who knew how to respect Lord Brahmä. Therefore instead of looking upon Brahmä with resentment, they very feelingly offered him their respect. Lord Brahmä then returned to his celestial abode, known as Satyaloka, which is described here as being impeccable and being unapproachable by words."

            "content": "It is stated in this verse that Lord Brahmä returned to his residence, which is as important as his own personality. Lord Brahmä is the creator of this universe and the most exalted personality within it. His lifetime is described in Bhagavad-gétä . Sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaëo viduù. The total duration of the four yugas is 4,300,000 years, and when that is multiplied a thousand times, it equals twelve hours in the life of Brahmä. Therefore we cannot factually comprehend even twelve hours of Brahmä's life, to say nothing of the one hundred years that constitute his entire lifetime. How, then, can we understand his abode? The Vedic literatures describe that in Satyaloka there is no birth, death, old age or disease. In other words, since Satyaloka is situated next to Brahmaloka, or the Brahman effulgence, it is almost as good as Vaikuëöhaloka. Lord Brahmä's abode is practically indescribable from our present status. Therefore it has been described as aväì-manasa-gocara, or beyond the description of our words and the imagination of our minds. The Vedic literatures thus describe the abode of Lord Brahmä: yad vai parärdhyaà tad upärameñöhyaà na yatra çoko na jarä na måtyur närtir na codvegaù. \"In Satyaloka, which is situated many millions and billions of years away, there is no lamentation, nor is there old age, death, anxiety or the influence of enemies.\""
