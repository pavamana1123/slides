This is because most gåhavratas are guided by sense gratification and therefore gradually glide down to the darkest regions of material existence (adänta-gobhir viçatäà tamisram ). How can they possibly become perfect in Kåñëa consciousness? Mahäräja Parékñit asked Çukadeva Gosvämé to resolve this great doubt."
