    "translation": "The personal weapon used by Lord Kåñëa, the disc, is called hari-cakra, the disc of Hari. This cakra is the wheel of time. It expands from the beginning of the atoms up to the time of Brahmä's death, and it controls all activities. It is always revolving and spending the lives of the living entities, from Lord Brahmä down to an insignificant blade of grass. Thus one changes from infancy, to childhood, to youth and maturity, and thus one approaches the end of life. It is impossible to check this wheel of time. This wheel is very exacting because it is the personal weapon of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes the conditioned soul, fearing the approach of death, wants to worship someone who can save him from imminent danger. Yet he does not care for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose weapon is the indefatigable time factor. The conditioned soul instead takes shelter of a man-made god described in unauthorized scriptures. Such gods are like buzzards, vultures, herons and crows. Vedic scriptures do not refer to them. Imminent death is like the attack of a lion, and neither vultures, buzzards, crows nor herons can save one from such an attack. One who takes shelter of unauthorized man-made gods cannot be saved from the clutches of death.",

            "content": "It is stated: harià vinä måtià na taranti. No one can save himself from the cruel hands of death without being favored by Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gétä it is stated, mäm eva ye prapadyante mäyäm etäà taranti te:  whoever fully surrenders unto Kåñëa can be saved from the cruel hands of material nature. The conditioned soul, however, sometimes wants to take shelter of a demigod, man-made god, pseudo incarnation or bogus svämé or yogé. All these cheaters claim to follow religious principles, and all this has become very popular in this age of Kali. There are many päñaëòés who, without referring to the çästras, pose themselves as incarnations, and foolish people follow them. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has left behind Him Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä. Not referring to these authorized scriptures, rascals take shelter of man-made scriptures and try to compete with Lord Kåñëa. That is the greatest difficulty one encounters when trying to promote spiritual consciousness in human society. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is trying its best to bring people back to Kåñëa consciousness in its pure form, but the päñaëòés and atheists, who are cheaters, are so numerous that sometimes we become perplexed and wonder how to push this movement forward. In any case, we cannot accept the unauthorized ways of so-called incarnations, gods, cheaters and bluffers, who are described here as crows, vultures, buzzards and herons."
