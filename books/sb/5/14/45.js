    "translation": "Even though in the body of a deer, Mahäräja Bharata did not forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore when he was giving up the body of a deer, he loudly uttered the following prayer: \"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sacrifice personified. He gives the results of ritualistic activity. He is the protector of religious systems, the personification of mystic yoga, the source of all knowledge, the controller of the entire creation, and the Supersoul in every living entity. He is beautiful and attractive. I am quitting this body offering obeisances unto Him and hoping that I may perpetually engage in His transcendental loving service.\" Uttering this, Mahäräja Bharata left his body.",

Whatever way of spiritual realization we accept, the ultimate goal is Näräyaëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entities are eternally connected with Him via devotional service. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, ante näräyaëa-småtiù: , çucénäà çrématäà gehe yoga-bhrañöo 'bhijäyate: \"One who falls from the path of self-realization takes birth in a family of brähmaëas or wealthy aristocrats.\" Although Mahäräja Bharata appeared in the royal family, he became neglectful and took birth as a deer. Because he was very cautious within his deer body, he took birth in a brähmaëa family as Jaòa Bharata. During this lifetime, he remained perfectly Kåñëa conscious and preached the gospel of Kåñëa consciousness directly, beginning with his instructions to Mahäräja Rahügaëa. In this regard, the word yogäya is very significant. The purpose of añöäìga-yoga, as stated by Madhväcärya, is to link or connect with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The goal is not to display some material perfections."
