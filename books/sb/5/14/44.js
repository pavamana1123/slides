    "translation": "Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: My dear King, the activities of Bharata Mahäräja are wonderful. He gave up everything difficult for others to give up. He gave up his kingdom, his wife and his family. His opulence was so great that even the demigods envied it, yet he gave it up. It was quite befitting a great personality like him to be a great devotee. He could renounce everything because he was so attracted to the beauty, opulence, reputation, knowledge, strength and renunciation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Kåñëa is so attractive that one can give up all desirable things for His sake. Indeed, even liberation is considered insignificant for those whose minds are attracted to the loving service of the Lord.",

In this way one increases life's illusions and thinks in terms of 'I and mine.' \" The attraction for material things is certainly due to illusion. There is no value in attraction to material things, for the conditioned soul is diverted by them. One's life is successful if he is absorbed in the attraction of Kåñëa's strength, beauty and pastimes as described in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The Mäyävädés are attracted to merging into the existence of the Lord, but Kåñëa is more attractive than the desire to merge. The word abhavaù means \"not to take birth again in this material world.\" A devotee doesn't care whether he is going to be reborn or not. He is simply satisfied with the Lord's service in any condition. That is real mukti."

That is his ambition. It doesn't matter whether he is in heaven or in hell. This is called uttamaçloka-lälasa."
