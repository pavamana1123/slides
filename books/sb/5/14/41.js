    "synonyms": "karma-vallém—the creeper of fruitive activities; avalambya—taking shelter of; tataù—from that; äpadaù—dangerous or miserable condition; kathaïcit—somehow or other; narakät—from the hellish condition of life; vimuktaù—being freed; punaù api—again; evam—in this way; saàsära-adhvani—on the path of material existence; vartamänaù—existing; nara-loka-sa-artham—the field of self-interested material activities; upayäti—he enters; evam—thus; upari—above (in the higher planetary systems); gataù api—although promoted.",
    "translation": "When the conditioned soul accepts the shelter of the creeper of fruitive activity, he may be elevated by his pious activities to higher planetary systems and thus gain liberation from hellish conditions, but unfortunately he cannot remain there. After reaping the results of his pious activities, he has to return to the lower planetary systems. In this way he perpetually goes up and comes down.",

As a monkey takes shelter of the branch of a banyan tree and thinks he is enjoying, the conditioned soul, not knowing the real interest of his life, takes shelter of the path of karma-käëòa, fruitive activities. Sometimes he is elevated to the heavenly planets by such activities, and sometimes he again descends to earth. This is described by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu as brahmäëòa bhramite. However, if by Kåñëa's grace one is fortunate enough to come under the shelter of the guru, by the mercy of Kåñëa he receives lessons on how to execute devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In this way he receives a clue of how to get out of his continuous struggle up and down within the material world. Therefore the Vedic injunction is that one should approach a spiritual master. The Vedas declare: tad-vijïänärthaà sa gurum eväbhigacchet [MU 1.2.12]. Similarly in Bhagavad-gétä  the Supreme Personality of Godhead advises:"

The qualification of his spiritual master is that he must have realized the conclusion of the scriptures by deliberation and be able to convince others of these conclusions. Such great personalities, who have taken shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all material considerations, are to be understood as bona fide spiritual masters.\" Similarly, Viçvanätha Cakravarté, a great Vaiñëava, also advises, yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädaù: \"By the mercy of the spiritual master one receives the mercy of Kåñëa.\" This is the same advice given by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu (guru-kåñëa-prasäde päya bhakti-latä-béja ). This is essential. One must come to Kåñëa consciousness, and therefore one must take shelter of a pure devotee. Thus one can become free from the clutches of matter."
