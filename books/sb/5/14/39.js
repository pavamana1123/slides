The only way out of it is association with devotees, and this association is very easy. Although unfortunate people also get this opportunity, due to their great misfortune they cannot take shelter of pure devotees, and consequently they continuously suffer. Nonetheless, this Kåñëa consciousness movement insists that everyone take to this path by adopting the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. The preachers of Kåñëa consciousness go from door to door to inform people how they can be relieved from the miserable conditions of material life. As stated by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, guru-kåñëa-prasäde päya bhakti-latä-béja:  by the mercy of Kåñëa and guru, one can get the seed of devotional service. If one is a little intelligent he can cultivate Kåñëa consciousness and be freed from the miserable conditions of material life."
