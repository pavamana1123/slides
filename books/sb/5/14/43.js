    "translation": "While in the prime of life, the great Mahäräja Bharata gave up everything because he was fond of serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Uttamaçloka. He gave up his beautiful wife, nice children, great friends and an enormous empire. Although these things were very difficult to give up, Mahäräja Bharata was so exalted that he gave them up just as one gives up stool after evacuating. Such was the greatness of His Majesty.",

Mahäräja Bharata was an ideal king, instructor and emperor of the world. He possessed all the opulences of the material world, but Kåñëa is so attractive that He attracted Mahäräja Bharata from all his material possessions. Yet somehow or other, the King became affectionate to a little deer and, falling from his position, had to accept the body of a deer in his next life. Due to Kåñëa's great mercy upon him, he could not forget his position, and he could understand how he had fallen. Therefore in the next life, as Jaòa Bharata, Mahäräja Bharata was careful not to spoil his energy, and therefore he presented himself as a deaf and dumb person. In this way he could concentrate on his devotional service. We have to learn from the great King Bharata how to become cautious in cultivating Kåñëa consciousness. A little inattention will retard our devotional service for the time being. Yet any service rendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is never lost: svalpam apy asya dharmasya träyate mahato bhayät :"

Even if one falls down due to immaturity or bad association, his devotional assets are never lost. There are many examples of this—Ajämila, Mahäräja Bharata, and many others. This Kåñëa consciousness movement is giving everyone a chance to engage in devotional service for at least some time. A little service will give one an impetus to advance and thus make one's life successful."

Aiçvaryasya samagrasya véryasya yaçasaù çriyaù (Viñëu Puräëa 6.5.47). Kåñëa's reputation is still expanding. We are spreading the glories of Kåñëa by pushing forward this Kåñëa consciousness movement. Kåñëa's reputation, five thousand years after the Battle of Kurukñetra, is still expanding throughout the world. Every important individual within this world must have heard of Kåñëa, especially at the present moment, due to the Kåñëa consciousness movement. Even people who do not like us and want to suppress the movement are also somehow or other chanting Hare Kåñëa. They say, \"The Hare Kåñëa people should be chastised.\" Such foolish people do not realize the true value of this movement, but the mere fact that they want to criticize it gives them a chance to chant Hare Kåñëa, and this is its success."
