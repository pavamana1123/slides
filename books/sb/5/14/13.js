    "translation": "Sometimes, to mitigate distresses in this forest of the material world, the conditioned soul receives cheap blessings from atheists. He then loses all intelligence in their association. This is exactly like jumping in a shallow river. As a result one simply breaks his head. He is not able to mitigate his sufferings from the heat, and in both ways he suffers. The misguided conditioned soul also approaches so-called sädhus and svämés who preach against the principles of the Vedas. He does not receive benefit from them, either in the present or in the future.",

To get some material benefit, the conditioned soul approaches these pseudo sannyäsés and yogés for cheap blessings, but he does not receive any benefit from them, either spiritual or material. In this age there are many cheaters who show some jugglery and magic. They even create gold to amaze their followers, and their followers accept them as God. This type of cheating is very prominent in Kali-yuga. Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura describes the real guru in this way."

If being able to manufacture gold is a criterion for becoming God, then why not accept Kåñëa, the proprietor of the entire universe, wherein there are countless tons of gold? As mentioned before, the color of gold is compared to the will-o'-the-wisp or yellow stool; therefore one should not be allured by gold-manufacturing gurus but should sincerely approach a devotee like Jaòa Bharata. Jaòa Bharata instructed Rahügaëa Mahäräja so well that the King was relieved from the bodily conception. One cannot become happy by accepting a false guru. A guru should be accepted as advised in Çrémad-Bhägavatam ). He is freed from all material contamination and is fully engaged in Kåñëa's service. If one is able to obtain the dust of the lotus feet of such a guru, his life becomes successful. Otherwise he is baffled both in this life and in the next."
