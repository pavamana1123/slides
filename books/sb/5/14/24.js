    "translation": "Stealing or cheating another person out of his money, the conditioned soul somehow or other keeps it in his possession and escapes punishment. Then another man, named Devadatta, cheats him and takes the money away. Similarly, another man, named Viñëumitra, steals the money from Devadatta and takes it away. In any case, the money does not stay in one place. It passes from one hand to another. Ultimately no one can enjoy the money, and it remains the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

The goddess of fortune cannot stay anywhere but by the side of Näräyaëa; therefore another of her names is Caïcalä, restless. She cannot be peaceful unless she is in the company of her husband, Näräyaëa. For example, Lakñmé was carried away by the materialistic Rävaëa. Rävaëa kidnapped Sétä, the goddess of fortune belonging to Lord Räma. As a result, Rävaëa's entire family, opulence and kingdom were smashed, and Sétä, the goddess of fortune, was recovered from his clutches and reunited with Lord Räma. Thus all property, riches and wealth belong to Kåñëa. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä :"

One person cheats another, and another person cheats someone else; therefore the best way to possess Lakñmé is to keep her by the side of Näräyaëa. This is the point of the Kåñëa consciousness movement. We worship Lakñmé (Rädhäräëé) along with Näräyaëa (Kåñëa). We collect money from various sources, but that money does not belong to anyone but Rädhä and Kåñëa (Lakñmé-Näräyaëa). If money is utilized in the service of Lakñmé-Näräyaëa, the devotee automatically lives in an opulent way. However, if one wants to enjoy Lakñmé the way Rävaëa did, he will be vanquished by the laws of nature, and whatever few possessions he has will be taken away. Finally death will take everything away, and death is the representative of Kåñëa."
