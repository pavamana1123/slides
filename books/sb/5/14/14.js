    "synonyms": "yadä—when; tu—but (because of misfortune); para-bädhayä—in spite of exploiting all others; andhaù—blind; ätmane—for himself; na upanamati—does not fall into one's share; tadä—at that time; hi—certainly; pitå-putra—of the father or sons; barhiñmataù—as insignificant as a piece of grass; pitå-puträn—father or sons; vä—or; saù—he (the conditioned soul); khalu—indeed; bhakñayati—gives trouble to.",
    "translation": "In this material world, when the conditioned soul cannot arrange for his own maintenance, despite exploiting others, he tries to exploit his own father or son, taking away that relative's possessions, although they may be very insignificant. If he cannot acquire things from his father, son or other relatives, he is prepared to give them all kinds of trouble.",

When a conditioned soul needs something, he forgets his relationship with his relatives and exploits his own father or son. We also receive information from Çrémad-Bhägavatam that in this age of Kali the time is quickly approaching when a relative will kill another relative for a small farthing. Without Kåñëa consciousness, people will deteriorate further and further into a hellish condition wherein they will perform abominable acts."
