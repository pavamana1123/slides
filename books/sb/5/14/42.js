    "translation": "Having summarized the teachings of Jaòa Bharata, Çukadeva Gosvämé said: My dear King Parékñit, the path indicated by Jaòa Bharata is like the path followed by Garuòa, the carrier of the Lord, and ordinary kings are just like flies. Flies cannot follow the path of Garuòa, and to date none of the great kings and victorious leaders could follow this path of devotional service, not even mentally.",

Although these kings were victorious on the battlefield, they could not conquer the bodily conception. There are many big leaders, yogés, svämés and so-called incarnations who are very much addicted to mental speculation and who advertise themselves as perfect personalities, but they are not ultimately successful. The path of devotional service is undoubtedly very difficult to follow, but it becomes very easy if the candidate actually wants to follow the path of the mahäjana. In this age there is the path of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who appeared to deliver all fallen souls. This path is so simple and easy that everyone can take to it by chanting the holy name of the Lord."
