    "translation": "Sometimes the conditioned soul is attracted by illusion personified (his wife or girl friend) and becomes eager to be embraced by a woman. Thus he loses his intelligence as well as knowledge of life's goal. At that time, no longer attempting spiritual cultivation, he becomes overly attached to his wife or girl friend and tries to provide her with a suitable apartment. Again, he becomes very busy under the shelter of that home and is captivated by the talks, glances and activities of his wife and children. In this way he loses his Kåñëa consciousness and throws himself in the dense darkness of material existence.",

            "content": "When the conditioned soul is embraced by his beloved wife, he forgets everything about Kåñëa consciousness. The more he becomes attached to his wife, the more he becomes implicated in family life. One Bengali poet, Bankim Chandra, says that to the eyes of the lover the beloved is always very beautiful, even though ugly. This attraction is called deva-mäyä. The attraction between man and woman is the cause of bondage for both. Actually both belong to the parä prakåti, the superior energy of the Lord, but both are actually prakåti (female). However, because both want to enjoy one another, they are sometimes described as puruña (male). Actually neither is puruña, but both can be superficially described as puruña. As soon as man and woman are united, they become attached to home, hearth, land, friendship and money. In this way they are both entrapped in material existence. The word bhuja-latä-upagüòha, meaning \"being embraced by beautiful arms which are compared to creepers,\" describes the way the conditioned soul is bound within this material world. The products of sex life—sons and daughters—certainly follow. This is the way of material existence."
