    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead replied: O great sages, I am certainly very pleased with your prayers. You are all truthful. You have prayed for the benediction of a son like Me for King Näbhi, but this is very difficult to obtain. Since I am the Supreme Person without a second and since no one is equal to Me, another personality like Me is not possible to find. In any case, because you are all qualified brähmaëas, your vibrations should not prove untrue. I consider the brähmaëas who are well qualified with brahminical qualities to be as good as My own mouth.",

            "content": "The word avitatha-gérbhiù means \"they whose spoken vibrations cannot be nullified.\" The brähmaëas (dvija, the twice-born), are given a chance by the çästric regulations to become almost as powerful as the Supreme Lord. Whatever a brähmaëa speaks cannot be nullified or changed in any circumstance. According to the Vedic injunctions, a brähmaëa is the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore in all rituals a brähmaëa is offered food (brähmaëa-bhojana) because when a brähmaëa eats, it is considered that the Supreme Lord Himself eats. Similarly, whatever a brähmaëa speaks cannot be changed. It must act. The learned sages who were priests at Mahäräja Näbhi's sacrifice were not only brähmaëas but were so qualified that they were like devas, demigods, or God Himself. If this were not the case, how could they invite Lord Viñëu to come to the sacrificial arena? God is one, and God does not belong to this or that religion. In Kali-yuga, different religious sects consider their God to be different from the God of others, but that is not possible. God is one, and He is appreciated according to different angles of vision. In this verse the word kaivalyät means that God has no competitor. There is only one God. In the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (6.8) it is said, na tat-samaç cäbhyadhikaç ca dåçyate: \"No one is found to be equal to Him or greater than Him.\" That is the definition of God."
