He performed many sacrifices along with his wife and worshiped Lord Viñëu, master of all sacrifices. Being very kind to His devotees, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was very pleased with the austerities of Mahäräja Näbhi. He personally appeared before the King in His four-handed feature, and the priests, who were performing the sacrifices, began to offer their prayers unto Him. They prayed for a son like the Lord, and Lord Viñëu agreed to take birth in the womb of Merudevé, the wife of King Näbhi, and incarnate as King Åñabhadeva."
