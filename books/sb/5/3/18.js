Although He is one without a second, He expands Himself by sväàça, His personal expansion, and sometimes by vibhinnäàça, or His separated expansion. Lord Viñëu herein agrees to send His personal expansion as the son of Merudevé, the wife of Mahäräja Näbhi, who is the son of Ägnédhra. The åtvijaù, the priests, knew that God is one, yet they prayed for the Supreme Lord to become the son of Mahäräja Näbhi to let the world know that the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is one without a second. When He incarnates, He expands Himself in different potencies."
