    "translation": "O Viñëudatta, Parékñit Mahäräja, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was pleased by the great sages at that sacrifice. Consequently the Lord decided to personally exhibit the method of executing religious principles [as observed by brahmacärés, sannyäsés, vänaprasthas and gåhasthas engaged in rituals] and also satisfy Mahäräja Näbhi's desire. Consequently He appeared as the son of Merudevé in His original spiritual form, which is above the modes of material nature.",

Mäyävädé philosophers say that the impersonal God appears in this material world by accepting a body in the sattva-guëa. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté states that the word çukla means \"consisting of çuddha-sattva.\" Lord Viñëu descends in His çuddha-sattva form. Çuddha-sattva refers to the sattva-guëa which is never contaminated. In this material world, even the mode of goodness (sattva-guëa) is contaminated by tinges of rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa. When sattva-guëa is never contaminated by rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa, it is called çuddha-sattva. Sattvaà viçuddhaà vasudeva-çabditam  Çré Kåñëa Himself says:"

He appears dharmän darçayitu-käma—to show how to execute the functions of a human being. The word dharma is meant for human beings and is never used in connection with beings inferior to human beings, such as animals. Unfortunately, without being guided by the Supreme Lord, human beings sometimes manufacture a process of dharma by concoction. Actually dharma cannot be made by man. Dharmaà tu säkñäd bhagavat-praëétam. . The son of Mahäräja Näbhi, Åñabhadeva, appeared on this earth to preach the principles of religion. That will be explained in the Fifth Chapter of this Fifth Canto."
