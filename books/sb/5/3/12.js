Please help us remember You and utter Your holy names, attributes and activities, which can dispel all the reactions of our sinful lives.",

Although we may be engaged in the Lord's devotional service in the temple, material conditions are so tough and inevitable that we may forget the Lord at the time of death due to a diseased condition or mental derangement. Therefore we should pray to the Lord to be able to remember His lotus feet without fail at the time of death, when we are in such a precarious condition. In this regard, one may also see Çrémad-Bhägavatam ."
