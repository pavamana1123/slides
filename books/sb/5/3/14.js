    "translation": "Dear Lord, unless one worships the lotus feet of great devotees, one will be conquered by the illusory energy, and his intelligence will be bewildered. Indeed, who has not been carried away by the waves of material enjoyment, which are like poison? Your illusory energy is unconquerable. No one can see the path of this material energy or tell how it is working.",

The son might be as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but such a material desire—be it great or insignificant—is brought about by the influence of mäyä. A devotee does not at all desire anything for sense gratification. Devotion is therefore explained as devoid of material desires (anyäbhiläñitä-çünya). Everyone is subjected to the influence of mäyä and entangled in all kinds of material desire, and Mahäräja Näbhi was no exception. Freedom from mäyä's influence is possible when one engages in the service of the great devotees (mahac-caraëa-sevä). Without worshiping the lotus feet of a great devotee, one cannot be freed from mäyä's influence. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura therefore says, chäòiyä vaiñëava-sevä nistära päyeche kebä: \"Who has been freed from mäyä's clutches without serving the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava?\" Mäyä is aparäjita, and her influence is also aparäjita. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä :"
